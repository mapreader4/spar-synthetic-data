Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ann, Becky, and Julia each serve 7 customers per hour
* They work for 8 hours each day, except for Julia who worked for 6 hours
* To find the total number of customers served, we need to calculate the number of customers served by each person and then add them together

For Ann and Becky:
* They each serve 7 customers per hour
* They work for 8 hours
* So, Ann and Becky each serve 7 customers x 8 hours = 56 customers

For Julia:
* She serves 7 customers per hour
* She works for 6 hours
* So, Julia serves 7 customers x 6 hours = 42 customers

Now, we add up the total number of customers served by all three:
* Ann: 56 customers
* Becky: 56 customers
* Julia: 42 customers
* Total: 56 + 56 + 42 = 154 customers

Answer: 154
