Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary has 4 times as many towels as Frances.
2) Mary has 24 towels.
3) Since Mary has 4 times as many towels as Frances, we can divide Mary's towels by 4 to find how many towels Frances has:
24 towels / 4 = 6 towels
4) The total weight of their towels is 60 pounds.
5) To find the weight of Frances's towels, we need to subtract Mary's towels' weight from the total weight:
60 pounds - (24 towels * weight per towel) = weight of Frances's towels
6) We don't know the weight per towel, but we can use the total weight of 60 pounds to solve for it:
60 pounds / (24 towels + 6 towels) = 2 pounds per towel
7) Now we can calculate the weight of Frances's towels:
6 towels * 2 pounds per towel = 12 pounds
8) To convert the weight of Frances's towels to ounces, we multiply by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
12 pounds * 16 ounces/pound = 192 ounces

Answer: 192 ounces
