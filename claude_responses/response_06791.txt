Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers.
2) She shared them between Susan, Andrew, and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively.
   - This means Susan and Andrew each got 1 part, and Sam got 3 parts.
   - To find the number of stickers each person got, we divide the total (1500) by the total number of parts (5), which gives us 300 stickers per part.
   - So Susan and Andrew each got 300 stickers, and Sam got 900 stickers.
3) Sam then gave two-thirds of his share to Andrew.
   - Sam's share was 900 stickers.
   - Two-thirds of 900 is 600 stickers.
   - So Andrew now has his original 300 stickers, plus the 600 stickers from Sam, for a total of 900 stickers.

Answer: 900
