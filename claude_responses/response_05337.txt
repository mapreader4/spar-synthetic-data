Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. This means that if Evan earned E dollars, then Markese earned E - 5 dollars.
2) Together, Markese and Evan earned $37. So we can write this as an equation:
E + (E - 5) = 37
3) Simplifying the equation, we get:
2E - 5 = 37
4) Adding 5 to both sides, we get:
2E = 42
5) Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
E = 21
6) Since Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan, we can calculate Markese's earnings as:
Markese's earnings = E - 5 = 21 - 5 = 16

Answer: 16
