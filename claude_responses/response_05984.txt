Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Debby takes 25% of the total amount
* Maggie takes the remaining 75% of the total amount
* Maggie's share is $4,500
* To find the total amount they agreed to share, we need to find the value of the 75% that Maggie received
* We can do this by dividing Maggie's share ($4,500) by 0.75 (75% expressed as a decimal)
* $4,500 / 0.75 = $6,000
* Therefore, the total amount they agreed to share is $6,000

Answer: $6,000
