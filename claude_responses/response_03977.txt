Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jane sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each. So, the total number of blue sequins is:
   6 rows x 8 sequins per row = 48 blue sequins
2) Jane sews 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each. So, the total number of purple sequins is:
   5 rows x 12 sequins per row = 60 purple sequins
3) Jane sews 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. So, the total number of green sequins is:
   9 rows x 6 sequins per row = 54 green sequins
4) To get the total number of sequins, we add up the blue, purple, and green sequins:
   48 + 60 + 54 = 162 sequins

Answer: 162
