Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 200.
2) Thomas takes 10% of the jelly beans, which is 0.10 * 200 = 20 jelly beans.
3) The remaining jelly beans are 200 - 20 = 180.
4) Barry and Emmanuel are to share the remaining 180 jelly beans in the ratio 4:5 respectively.
5) The total ratio is 4 + 5 = 9.
6) Emmanuel's share is 5/9 of the remaining 180 jelly beans, which is (5/9) * 180 = 100 jelly beans.

Answer: 100
