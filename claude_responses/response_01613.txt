Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John visits 50 houses a day
* 20% of the houses he visits buy something from him
* Of those who buy something, half buy a $50 set of knives and the other half buy a $150 set of knives
* He works 5 days a week

First, let's calculate how many houses buy something from him per day:
* 20% of 50 houses = 0.20 * 50 = 10 houses

Now, let's calculate how much he sells per day:
* Half of the 10 houses buy the $50 set of knives, so that's 5 * $50 = $250
* The other half buy the $150 set of knives, so that's 5 * $150 = $750
* Total sales per day = $250 + $750 = $1,000

Finally, let's calculate his weekly sales:
* He works 5 days a week
* His daily sales are $1,000
* Weekly sales = $1,000 * 5 = $5,000

Answer: $5,000
