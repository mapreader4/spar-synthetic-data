Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The president has raised $10,000 in campaign funds
* His friends raised 40% of this amount
* To calculate 40% of $10,000:
    - 40% of $10,000 = 0.4 * $10,000 = $4,000
* The remaining amount after the friends' contribution is:
    - $10,000 - $4,000 = $6,000
* His family raised 30% of the remaining $6,000
* To calculate 30% of $6,000:
    - 30% of $6,000 = 0.3 * $6,000 = $1,800
* The remaining amount after the family's contribution is:
    - $6,000 - $1,800 = $4,200
* This remaining $4,200 is the amount the president saved for the presidency.

Answer: $4,200
