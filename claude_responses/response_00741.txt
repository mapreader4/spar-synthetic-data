Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Angelina is 4 years older than Justin is now.
2) In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old.
3) To find Angelina's current age, we can subtract 5 years from 40 years:
   Angelina's current age = 40 - 5 = 35 years old
4) Since Angelina is 4 years older than Justin, we can subtract 4 years from Angelina's current age to find Justin's current age:
   Justin's current age = 35 - 4 = 31 years old.

Answer: 31
