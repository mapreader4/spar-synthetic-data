Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Debra interviews 3 singers each week
* The first interview segment is twice as long as the other two segments combined
* The third interview segment is half as long as the second
* The third segment is 10 minutes long

Let's start with the third segment, which is 10 minutes long.
* The third segment is half as long as the second segment
* So the second segment must be 2 x 10 = 20 minutes long

Now, the first segment is twice as long as the other two segments combined.
* The other two segments are 10 minutes and 20 minutes, so they are 30 minutes combined
* The first segment is twice as long, so it must be 2 x 30 = 60 minutes long

Now we can calculate the total length of the show:
* First segment: 60 minutes
* Second segment: 20 minutes
* Third segment: 10 minutes
* Total length of the show: 60 + 20 + 10 = 90 minutes

Answer: 90
