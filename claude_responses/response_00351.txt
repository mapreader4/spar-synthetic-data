Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 36 weeks of school
* Jackson's mom packs him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on Wednesdays and Fridays
* Jackson has missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays

First, let's calculate the number of Wednesdays and Fridays in the school year:
* There are 36 weeks of school
* Jackson has 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays missed
* So, there are 36 - 1 = 35 Wednesdays and 36 - 2 = 34 Fridays

Now, let's add up the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches he ate:
* 35 Wednesdays + 34 Fridays = 69 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

Answer: 69
