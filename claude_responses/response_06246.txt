Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 600 cookies in the box originally.
2) Nicole ate 2/5 of the total number of cookies. 
   * 2/5 of 600 = 2/5 * 600 = 240 cookies
   * So Nicole ate 240 cookies.
3) The remaining number of cookies after Nicole ate 240 is 600 - 240 = 360 cookies.
4) Eduardo ate 3/5 of the remaining 360 cookies.
   * 3/5 of 360 = 3/5 * 360 = 216 cookies
   * So Eduardo ate 216 cookies.
5) The remaining number of cookies after Eduardo ate 216 is 360 - 216 = 144 cookies.
6) The percentage of the original 600 cookies that remained is:
   * (144 / 600) * 100 = 24%

Answer: 24
