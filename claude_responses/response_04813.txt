Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Laura needs to buy window treatments for 3 windows
* For each window, she needs to buy a set of sheers and a set of drapes
* The sheers cost $40.00 per pair
* The drapes cost $60.00 per pair
* To calculate the total cost, we need to:
  1. Calculate the cost of the sheers for all 3 windows
  2. Calculate the cost of the drapes for all 3 windows
  3. Add the cost of the sheers and the drapes together

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the sheers for all 3 windows
* Sheers cost $40.00 per pair
* Laura needs 3 pairs of sheers (one for each window)
* 3 pairs of sheers x $40.00 per pair = $120.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the drapes for all 3 windows
* Drapes cost $60.00 per pair
* Laura needs 3 pairs of drapes (one for each window)
* 3 pairs of drapes x $60.00 per pair = $180.00

Step 3: Add the cost of the sheers and the drapes together
* $120.00 (sheers) + $180.00 (drapes) = $300.00

Answer: $300
