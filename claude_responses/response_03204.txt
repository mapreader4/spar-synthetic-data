Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark has two dozen eggs
* A dozen is 12 eggs
* So, Mark has 2 x 12 = 24 eggs
* Mark has to split the 24 eggs with his 3 siblings
* To split the eggs evenly, we need to divide the total number of eggs (24) by the total number of people (4, including Mark)
* 24 รท 4 = 6
* Therefore, each person gets 6 eggs.
