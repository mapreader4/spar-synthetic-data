Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bert had only half the stamps he bought before the purchase.
2) He bought 300 stamps.
3) So, before the purchase, he had 300 / 2 = 150 stamps.
4) After the purchase, he has the 150 stamps he had before, plus the 300 stamps he bought.
5) Therefore, the total number of stamps Bert has after the purchase is 150 + 300 = 450.

Answer: 450
