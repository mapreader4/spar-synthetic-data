Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of the 4-pack of fancy, sliced meat is $40.00.
2) Fred wants to add rush delivery, which is an additional 30% of the $40.00 cost.
3) To calculate the additional cost of rush delivery, we take 30% of $40.00, which is $12.00.
4) The total cost of the 4-pack of fancy, sliced meat with rush delivery is $40.00 + $12.00 = $52.00.
5) To calculate the cost of each type of sliced meat, we divide the total cost of $52.00 by 4, since there are 4 types of meat in the pack.

Answer: $13.00
