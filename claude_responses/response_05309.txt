Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vivian's students get 2 recess breaks a day, each 15 minutes long
* So the total time for the two recess breaks is:
  * 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes
* Vivian's students also get a 30-minute lunch break
* And they get another 20-minute recess break
* To calculate the total time spent outside of class, we add up all these times:
  * 30 minutes (2 recess breaks) + 30 minutes (lunch) + 20 minutes (1 recess break)
  * = 80 minutes

Answer: 80
