Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The book club has 3 couples and 5 single people, plus Ron and his wife.
* That means there are 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 members in the club.
* Each member gets to pick a new book every week.
* There are 52 weeks in a year.
* Therefore, Ron gets to pick a new book 52 / 10 = 5.2 times per year.

Since the question is asking for an integer, we need to round down the answer to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 5
