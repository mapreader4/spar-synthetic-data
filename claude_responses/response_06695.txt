Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lighters cost $1.75 each at the gas station
* Lighters cost $5.00 per pack of 12 on Amazon
* Amanda wants to buy 24 lighters

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 24 lighters at the gas station:
* 24 lighters x $1.75 per lighter = $42.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 24 lighters on Amazon:
* 24 lighters / 12 lighters per pack = 2 packs
* 2 packs x $5.00 per pack = $10.00

To calculate the savings, we take the gas station cost and subtract the Amazon cost:
* $42.00 - $10.00 = $32.00

Answer: $32.00
