Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Eugene used 75 toothpicks for each card in the deck of playing cards.
2) The deck of playing cards had 52 cards.
3) Eugene used all but 16 of the cards to build his house.
4) So, the number of cards he used is 52 - 16 = 36 cards.
5) For each of the 36 cards, he used 75 toothpicks.
6) So, the total number of toothpicks used is 36 cards * 75 toothpicks per card = 2,700 toothpicks.
7) A box of toothpicks contains 450 toothpicks.
8) To find the number of boxes of toothpicks Eugene used, we divide the total number of toothpicks used (2,700) by the number of toothpicks in a box (450).
9) 2,700 / 450 = 6 boxes of toothpicks.
