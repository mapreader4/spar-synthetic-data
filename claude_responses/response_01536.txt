Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cost of a movie ticket is $5.
* The cost of the popcorn is 80% of the cost of the ticket, which means the cost of the popcorn is $4 (80% of $5).
* The cost of a can of soda is 50% of the cost of the popcorn, which means the cost of a can of soda is $2 (50% of $4).
* The family bought:
  - 4 tickets at $5 each, so the total cost of the tickets is $20.
  - 2 sets of popcorn at $4 each, so the total cost of the popcorn is $8.
  - 4 cans of soda at $2 each, so the total cost of the soda is $8.
* To calculate the total amount spent, we add up the costs of the tickets, popcorn, and soda:
  - $20 + $8 + $8 = $36.
