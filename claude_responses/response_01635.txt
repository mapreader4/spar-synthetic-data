Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. To find Janet's semester 1 average, we need to calculate the average of her four grades: 90, 80, 70, and 100.
2. To calculate the average, we add up the four grades and divide by 4:
   (90 + 80 + 70 + 100) / 4 = 340 / 4 = 85
3. So Janet's semester 1 average was 85 percent.
4. Janet's semester 2 average was 82 percent.
5. To find the difference between her semester 1 and semester 2 averages, we subtract the semester 2 average from the semester 1 average:
   85 - 82 = 3
