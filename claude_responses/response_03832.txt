Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The florist planted 125 seeds for each color of flower (red, yellow, orange, and purple).
2) The fungus killed 45 red flowers, 61 yellow flowers, 30 orange flowers, and 40 purple flowers.
3) To calculate the number of flowers remaining, we subtract the number of flowers killed from the number of flowers planted:
   - Red flowers: 125 - 45 = 80 remaining
   - Yellow flowers: 125 - 61 = 64 remaining
   - Orange flowers: 125 - 30 = 95 remaining
   - Purple flowers: 125 - 40 = 85 remaining
4) Each bouquet contains 9 flowers of any color combinations.
5) To calculate the number of bouquets the florist can make, we need to find the minimum number of flowers available across all colors.
6) The minimum number of flowers available is 64 (yellow flowers).
7) Since each bouquet requires 9 flowers, the maximum number of bouquets the florist can make is:
   - 64 flowers / 9 flowers per bouquet = 7.11 bouquets
8) Since we can only make whole bouquets, we round down to the nearest integer.

Answer: 7 bouquets
