Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kiki buys twice as many hats as scarves.
2) She spends 60% of her money on hats and the rest on scarves.
3) She currently has $90.

Let's start by finding out how much she spends on hats:
* 60% of $90 = 0.6 * $90 = $54

Now, we know that she spends the remaining 40% on scarves:
* 40% of $90 = 0.4 * $90 = $36

Since she buys twice as many hats as scarves, we can say that the number of scarves she buys is half the number of hats.
* Let x be the number of scarves she buys.
* Then the number of hats she buys is 2x.

We know that she spends $54 on hats, and each hat costs the same amount as each scarf, which is $2.
* 2x * $2 = $54
* x = 13.5

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a scarf, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 13 scarves.
