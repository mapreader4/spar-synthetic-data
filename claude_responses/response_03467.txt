Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* George has been given a special $1 bill from his parents since his 15th birthday.
* He has been given these bills for 10 years (from his 15th to 24th birthday).
* He has spent 20% of these bills.
* On his 25th birthday, his parents will give him $1.5 for every bill he still has.

First, we need to calculate how many special bills he has received in total:
* 10 years x 1 bill per year = 10 bills

Next, we need to calculate how many bills he has spent:
* 20% of 10 bills = 2 bills

Now, we can calculate how many bills he has left:
* 10 bills - 2 bills = 8 bills

Finally, we can calculate how much he will receive from his parents:
* 8 bills x $1.5 per bill = $12

Answer: 12
