Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Max asks for 1 train for every birthday
* He asks for 2 trains each Christmas
* He asks for these gifts every year for 5 years
* At the end of the 5 years, his parents give him double the number of trains he already has

First, let's calculate the number of trains he gets each year:
* Birthdays: 1 train per year for 5 years = 5 trains
* Christmases: 2 trains per year for 5 years = 10 trains
* Total trains per year = 5 + 10 = 15 trains

Now, let's calculate the total number of trains he has after 5 years:
* Total trains after 5 years = 15 trains per year x 5 years = 75 trains

Finally, his parents give him double the number of trains he already has:
* Double the number of trains he already has = 75 x 2 = 150 trains

Answer: 150 trains
