Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maci needs 10 blue pens and 15 red pens.
2) Each blue pen costs 10 cents.
3) Each red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, which is 20 cents.
4) To calculate the total cost of the blue pens, we multiply the number of blue pens (10) by the cost of each blue pen (10 cents):
   10 blue pens x 10 cents per pen = 100 cents = $1.00
5) To calculate the total cost of the red pens, we multiply the number of red pens (15) by the cost of each red pen (20 cents):
   15 red pens x 20 cents per pen = 300 cents = $3.00
6) To get the total cost, we add the cost of the blue pens and the cost of the red pens:
   $1.00 + $3.00 = $4.00

Answer: $4.00
