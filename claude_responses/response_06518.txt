Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dani gets 4 pairs of two pants each year as pay for winning the best Amazon buyer of the season.
* This means he gets 4 x 2 = 8 pants per year.
* He initially had 50 pants.
* We want to calculate the number of pants he'll have in 5 years.

To do this, we can calculate the number of pants he'll have after each year:
* Year 1: 50 + 8 = 58 pants
* Year 2: 58 + 8 = 66 pants
* Year 3: 66 + 8 = 74 pants
* Year 4: 74 + 8 = 82 pants
* Year 5: 82 + 8 = 90 pants

Answer: 90 pants.
