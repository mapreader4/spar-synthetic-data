Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Bodhi has 20 cows, 15 foxes, and three times as many zebras as foxes.
2) To find the number of zebras, we take 3 times the number of foxes, which is 3 * 15 = 45 zebras.
3) The total number of animals currently in the yacht is 20 cows + 15 foxes + 45 zebras = 80 animals.
4) The total number of animals needed in the yacht to balance it is 100.
5) To find the number of sheep Mr. Bodhi needs to add, we subtract the current number of animals (80) from the required number of animals (100).
6) 100 - 80 = 20 sheep.

Answer: 20
