Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Christine picked 10 pounds of strawberries.
2) Rachel picked twice as much as Christine, which means she picked 20 pounds of strawberries.
3) Together, they picked a total of 10 + 20 = 30 pounds of strawberries.
4) They need 3 pounds of strawberries per pie.
5) To calculate the number of pies they can make, we divide the total pounds of strawberries by the pounds needed per pie:
30 pounds of strawberries / 3 pounds per pie = 10 pies.
