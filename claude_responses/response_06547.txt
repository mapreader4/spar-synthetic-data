Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sally sewed 4 shirts on Monday
* Sally sewed 3 shirts on Tuesday
* Sally sewed 2 shirts on Wednesday
* So the total number of shirts she sewed is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 shirts
* Each shirt has 5 buttons
* To find the total number of buttons, we need to multiply the total number of shirts by the number of buttons per shirt:
* 9 shirts x 5 buttons per shirt = 45 buttons

Answer: 45
