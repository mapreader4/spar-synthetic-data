Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 2 puppies, 2 kittens, and 3 parakeets for sale
* The puppies are 3 times more expensive than the parakeets
* The parakeets are half as expensive as the kittens
* The cost of one parakeet is $10

First, let's find the cost of the parakeets:
* Since the parakeets are half as expensive as the kittens, the cost of one kitten is 2 x $10 = $20
* The cost of the 3 parakeets is 3 x $10 = $30

Next, let's find the cost of the puppies:
* Since the puppies are 3 times more expensive than the parakeets, the cost of one puppy is 3 x $10 = $30
* The cost of the 2 puppies is 2 x $30 = $60

Finally, let's add up the cost of all the pets:
* Total cost = Cost of parakeets + Cost of kittens + Cost of puppies
* Total cost = $30 + (2 x $20) + $60 = $130

Answer: $130
