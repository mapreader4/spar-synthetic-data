Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. John's monthly income is $2000
* He spends approximately 5% of this amount on public transport to and from the mall
* To calculate the amount he spends on public transport, we take 5% of his monthly income:
* 5% of $2000 = 0.05 x $2000 = $100
* Now, to calculate the amount he has left after deducting his monthly transport fare, we subtract the transport fare from his monthly income:
* $2000 - $100 = $1900

Answer: $1900
