Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack goes up 3 flights of stairs
* Each flight of stairs has 12 steps
* Each step is 8 inches high
* So, the total height Jack climbs up is:
    - 3 flights x 12 steps/flight x 8 inches/step = 288 inches
* Then, Jack goes down 6 flights of stairs
* The total height Jack goes down is:
    - 6 flights x 12 steps/flight x 8 inches/step = 576 inches
* The difference between the height Jack goes up and the height he goes down is:
    - 576 inches - 288 inches = 288 inches
* To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 inches/foot:
    - 288 inches / 12 inches/foot = 24 feet

Answer: 24 feet
