Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The firefighter is paid $30 per hour for a 48-hour workweek.
2) To calculate his weekly pay, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours worked per week: $30 x 48 = $1,440 per week.
3) To calculate his monthly pay, we multiply his weekly pay by 4 weeks per month: $1,440 x 4 = $5,760 per month.
4) The firefighter pays 1/3 of his monthly pay on rent. 1/3 of $5,760 is $1,920.
5) The firefighter also pays $500 on food and $1,000 on taxes per month.
6) To calculate the total monthly expenses, we add up the rent, food, and taxes: $1,920 + $500 + $1,000 = $3,420.
7) To calculate the amount of money the firefighter has after paying his monthly expenses, we subtract the total monthly expenses from his monthly pay: $5,760 - $3,420 = $2,340.

Answer: $2,340
