Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt can write 10 words per minute with his right hand
* Matt can write 7 words per minute with his left hand
* We want to find the difference in the number of words written in 5 minutes with the right hand versus the left hand

First, let's calculate the number of words written in 5 minutes with the right hand:
* 10 words per minute x 5 minutes = 50 words

Next, let's calculate the number of words written in 5 minutes with the left hand:
* 7 words per minute x 5 minutes = 35 words

Finally, to find the difference, we subtract the number of words written with the left hand from the number of words written with the right hand:
* 50 words - 35 words = 15 words

Answer: 15
