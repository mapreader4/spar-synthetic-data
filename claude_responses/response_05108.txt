Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Benjamin bought a salad, a burger, and two packs of fries
* He paid a total of $15
* We know that one pack of fries costs $2
* We also know that the salad costs three times the price of one pack of fries

First, let's calculate the cost of the salad:
* The salad costs three times the price of one pack of fries
* So, the salad costs 3 x $2 = $6

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fries:
* There are two packs of fries, and each pack costs $2
* So, the total cost of the fries is 2 x $2 = $4

Now, we can calculate the cost of the burger:
* The total amount paid is $15
* The cost of the salad is $6
* The cost of the fries is $4
* So, the cost of the burger must be $15 - $6 - $4 = $5

Answer: $5
