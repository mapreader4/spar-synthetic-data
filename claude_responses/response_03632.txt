Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 2 notebooks
* Each notebook has 50 pages
* So the total number of pages is 2 * 50 = 100 pages
* James pays $5 for the 2 notebooks
* To find the cost per page, we divide the total cost by the total number of pages:
* $5 / 100 pages = $0.05 per page
* Converting to cents, $0.05 per page = 5 cents per page
