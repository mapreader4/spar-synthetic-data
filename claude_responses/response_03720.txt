Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The baker sells pastries for $5 each
* He works 7 days a week
* On Monday, he sold 2 pastries
* Every day, the number of sales increases by 1 compared to the previous day

To find the average number of pastries sold per day, we need to calculate the total number of pastries sold in a week and divide it by 7.

The number of pastries sold each day is:
* Monday: 2
* Tuesday: 2 + 1 = 3
* Wednesday: 3 + 1 = 4
* Thursday: 4 + 1 = 5
* Friday: 5 + 1 = 6
* Saturday: 6 + 1 = 7
* Sunday: 7 + 1 = 8

The total number of pastries sold in a week is:
2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 35

To find the average, we divide the total by 7 days:
35 / 7 = 5
