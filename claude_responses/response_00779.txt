Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The flowers cost $9
* The clay pot costs $20 more than the flowers, so the clay pot costs $9 + $20 = $29
* The bag of soil costs $2 less than the flowers, so the bag of soil costs $9 - $2 = $7

Now, to calculate the total cost to plant the flowers, we add up the costs of the flowers, the clay pot, and the bag of soil:
* Total cost = $9 + $29 + $7 = $45

Answer: $45
