Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The factory was planning to produce 200 cars
* Each car has 5 doors
* Due to metal shortages, they decreased production by 50 cars
* So the new planned production is 200 - 50 = 150 cars
* Due to a pandemic, they had to cut production by another 50%
* 50% of 150 cars is 0.5 * 150 = 75 cars
* So the final production is 150 - 75 = 75 cars
* Each car has 5 doors
* Therefore, the total number of doors produced is 75 cars * 5 doors per car = 375 doors

Answer: 375
