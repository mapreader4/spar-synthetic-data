Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Burmese python was 1.4 meters long initially.
* The alligator it swallowed was 50 centimeters long.
* It took the snake 1 week to completely digest the alligator.
* The snake continues to eat 50-centimeter-long alligators at a constant rate of one alligator per week.
* We need to find the maximum number of alligators the snake can eat in 616 days.

To calculate this, we need to first convert the time period from days to weeks:
* 616 days = 616 / 7 = 88 weeks

Now, we can calculate the maximum number of alligators the snake can eat in 88 weeks:
* 88 weeks x 1 alligator per week = 88 alligators

Therefore, the maximum number of alligators the snake can eat in 616 days is:

Answer: 88
