Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom buys 20 shares of a stock that costs $3 each. So, the total cost of the shares is:
20 shares x $3 per share = $60
2) Tom then sells 10 of those shares for $4 each. So, the total revenue from the sale is:
10 shares x $4 per share = $40
3) The remaining 10 shares double in value, so each share is now worth $6. The total value of the remaining shares is:
10 shares x $6 per share = $60
4) To calculate the total profit, we take the total revenue ($40 from the sale) and add the final value of the remaining shares ($60), and subtract the initial cost ($60):
$40 + $60 - $60 = $40
Answer: $40
