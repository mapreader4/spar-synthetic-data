Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John assembles computers and sells them as a business
* The parts for each computer cost $800
* He sells the computers for 1.4 times the value of the components
* He builds and sells 60 computers a month
* He has to pay $5000 a month in rent
* He has to pay $3000 a month in non-rent extra expenses

First, let's calculate the selling price of each computer:
* Selling price = 1.4 x $800 = $1120

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60 computers per month:
* Total revenue = 60 x $1120 = $67,200

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the components for 60 computers:
* Total cost of components = 60 x $800 = $48,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly expenses:
* Rent = $5,000
* Non-rent expenses = $3,000
* Total monthly expenses = $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000

Finally, let's calculate the monthly profit:
* Monthly profit = Total revenue - Total cost of components - Total monthly expenses
* Monthly profit = $67,200 - $48,000 - $8,000 = $11,200

Answer: $11,200
