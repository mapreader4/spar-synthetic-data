Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brady will make $450 more in a year than Dwayne.
2) Dwayne makes $1,500 in a year.
3) To find how much Brady makes in a year, we add $450 to Dwayne's income:
   Dwayne's income: $1,500
   Brady's income: $1,500 + $450 = $1,950
4) To find the combined income of Brady and Dwayne in a year, we add their individual incomes:
   Brady's income: $1,950
   Dwayne's income: $1,500
   Combined income: $1,950 + $1,500 = $3,450

Answer: $3,450
