Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 12 lions and 14 tigers at the feline sanctuary
* The number of cougars was half the combined number of lions and tigers
* To find the number of cougars, we first need to find the combined number of lions and tigers:
  - 12 lions + 14 tigers = 26 lions and tigers
* Since the number of cougars is half the combined number of lions and tigers, we can calculate the number of cougars as:
  - 26 lions and tigers / 2 = 13 cougars
* Now we can find the total number of big cats at the feline sanctuary by adding up the number of lions, tigers, and cougars:
  - 12 lions + 14 tigers + 13 cougars = 39 big cats

Answer: 39
