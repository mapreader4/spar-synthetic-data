Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Michael's chickens increase by 150 chickens annually.
2) The number of chickens on his farm now is 550.
3) We need to find the number of chickens he will have after 9 years.
4) To do this, we can calculate the increase in chickens over 9 years:
   - 150 chickens per year x 9 years = 1,350 additional chickens
5) Then, we can add this increase to the current number of chickens:
   - 550 chickens + 1,350 chickens = 1,900 chickens

Answer: 1,900
