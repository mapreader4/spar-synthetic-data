Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 12 more green apples than red apples.
2) We also know that there are 16 red apples.
3) So, the number of green apples is 16 + 12 = 28.
4) The total number of apples in the bowl is the sum of the red apples and the green apples.
5) The total number of apples is 16 + 28 = 44.

Answer: 44
