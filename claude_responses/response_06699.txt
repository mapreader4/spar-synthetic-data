Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Replacing the 20 rose bushes:
   * Each rose bush costs $150
   * 20 rose bushes x $150 per bush = $3,000

2. Hiring the gardener:
   * The gardener charges $30 per hour
   * The gardener works 5 hours each day for 4 days
   * 5 hours x 4 days = 20 hours
   * 20 hours x $30 per hour = $600

3. Purchasing the soil:
   * 100 cubic feet of soil is needed
   * The soil costs $5 per cubic foot
   * 100 cubic feet x $5 per cubic foot = $500

Now, we can add up all the expenses to get the total cost of the gardening project:
* $3,000 (rose bushes) + $600 (gardener) + $500 (soil) = $4,100

Answer: $4,100
