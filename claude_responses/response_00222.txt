Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bekah had to read 408 pages for her history class
* She read 113 pages over the weekend
* She has 5 days left to finish her reading

To find how many pages she needs to read each day for the remaining 5 days, we need to:
1. Calculate how many pages are left to read:
   * Total pages: 408
   * Pages read: 113
   * Pages left to read: 408 - 113 = 295

2. Divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
   * Pages left to read: 295
   * Days left: 5
   * Pages to read per day: 295 / 5 = 59

Therefore, Bekah will need to read 59 pages each day for the remaining 5 days to complete her assignment.

Answer: 59
