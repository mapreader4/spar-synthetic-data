Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Meso can type 15 pages in 5 minutes, which means Meso can type 3 pages per minute (15 pages / 5 minutes = 3 pages/minute)
* Tyler can type 15 pages in 3 minutes, which means Tyler can type 5 pages per minute (15 pages / 3 minutes = 5 pages/minute)
* Together, Meso and Tyler can type 3 + 5 = 8 pages per minute
* To type 40 pages, it would take them 40 pages / 8 pages per minute = 5 minutes

Answer: 5 minutes
