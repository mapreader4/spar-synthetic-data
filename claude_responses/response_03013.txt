Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John bench presses 15 pounds for 10 reps
* He does 3 sets of this
* To calculate the total weight moved, we need to:
  1. Calculate the weight moved in one set
  2. Multiply that by the number of sets

Step 1: Calculate the weight moved in one set
* John bench presses 15 pounds for 10 reps
* So, in one set, he moves 15 pounds x 10 reps = 150 pounds

Step 2: Multiply the weight moved in one set by the number of sets
* John does 3 sets
* So, the total weight moved is 150 pounds x 3 sets = 450 pounds

Answer: 450 pounds
