Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The dragon originally had an unknown number of jewels in its hoard.
* The king stole 3 of the dragon's prize jewels.
* The dragon then stole back its 3 jewels, plus twice as many of the king's crown jewels.
* The new jewels the dragon stole were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before.

Let's use variables to represent the unknown quantities:
* Let x = the original number of jewels the dragon owned.
* The king stole 3 of the dragon's jewels, so the dragon now has x - 3 jewels.
* The dragon then stole back its 3 jewels, plus twice as many of the king's crown jewels. So the dragon now has x - 3 + 3 + 2(3) = x + 3 jewels.
* The new jewels the dragon stole were a third of the original number, so x + 3 = x/3.

Solving this equation:
* x + 3 = x/3
* 3x + 9 = x
* 2x = 9
* x = 4.5

However, since the number of jewels must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 4 jewels
