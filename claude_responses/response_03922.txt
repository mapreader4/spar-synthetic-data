Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The car manufacturing company currently produces 100 cars per month.
2) The target is to produce 1800 cars per year.
3) To calculate the current annual production, we multiply the monthly production by 12 months:
100 cars per month x 12 months = 1200 cars per year.
4) To reach the target of 1800 cars per year, the company needs to increase its annual production by 1800 - 1200 = 600 cars.
5) To increase the annual production by 600 cars, the company needs to increase its monthly production by 600 / 12 = 50 cars per month.
