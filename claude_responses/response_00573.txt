Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bert sold 8 toy phones for $18 each. To calculate Bert's total earnings, we multiply the number of phones (8) by the price per phone ($18):
   8 phones x $18 per phone = $144

2. Tory sold 7 toy guns for $20 each. To calculate Tory's total earnings, we multiply the number of guns (7) by the price per gun ($20):
   7 guns x $20 per gun = $140

3. To find the difference between Bert's and Tory's earnings, we subtract Tory's earnings from Bert's earnings:
   $144 - $140 = $4

Therefore, Bert earned $4 more than Tory.
