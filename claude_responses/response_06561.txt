Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Bob buys 50 feet of rope.
2. He uses a 5th of it to make a small piece of art. 
   * 50 feet / 5 = 10 feet used for the art piece.
   * 50 feet - 10 feet = 40 feet remaining.
3. He takes the remaining 40 feet and gives half of it to his friend.
   * 40 feet / 2 = 20 feet given to the friend.
   * 40 feet - 20 feet = 20 feet remaining.
4. He cuts the remaining 20 feet into 2-foot sections.
   * 20 feet / 2 feet per section = 10 sections.

Answer: 10 sections.
