Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The total number of people in Nantucket is 300.
2) Half of all the people in Nantucket will attend the meeting.
3) So the total number of people attending the meeting is 300 / 2 = 150.
4) The number of males going to the meeting is twice the number of females.
5) Let's call the number of females going to the meeting x.
6) Then the number of males going to the meeting is 2x.
7) The total number of people going to the meeting is the sum of the males and females, which is 2x + x = 3x.
8) We know the total number of people going to the meeting is 150, so 3x = 150.
9) Solving for x, we get x = 50.

Answer: 50 females are going to the meeting.
