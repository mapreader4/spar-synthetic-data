To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage discount on the original price of the dress.

Given information:
- The original price of the dress is $350.
- The sale price of the dress is $140.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of discount.
Amount of discount = Original price - Sale price
Amount of discount = $350 - $140 = $210

Step 2: Calculate the percentage discount.
Percentage discount = (Amount of discount / Original price) × 100
Percentage discount = ($210 / $350) × 100 = 60%

Answer: 60%
