Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has 3 children
* John bought 2 notebooks for each of his 3 children
* So, John bought a total of 2 x 3 = 6 notebooks
* John's wife bought 5 notebooks for each of the 3 children
* So, John's wife bought a total of 5 x 3 = 15 notebooks
* To find the total number of notebooks bought, we add the number of notebooks bought by John and his wife:
* Total notebooks bought = 6 + 15 = 21

Answer: 21
