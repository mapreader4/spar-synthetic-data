Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joe saved $6,000 for his trip to Australia.
2) He spent $1,200 on the flight.
3) He spent $800 on a hotel.
4) He spent $3,000 on food.
5) To calculate the amount of money he has left, we need to subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he saved.
6) Total amount spent = $1,200 + $800 + $3,000 = $5,000
7) Amount saved - Total amount spent = $6,000 - $5,000 = $1,000

Answer: $1,000
