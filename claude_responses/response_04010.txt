* Beth bakes 4, 2 dozen batches of cookies in a week
* 1 dozen = 12 cookies
* So, 4 batches of 2 dozen each = 4 x 2 x 12 = 96 cookies
* These cookies are shared amongst 16 people equally
* To find how many cookies each person consumes, we divide the total number of cookies (96) by the number of people (16)
