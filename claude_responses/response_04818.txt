Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Peggy initially has 6 dolls.
2) Her grandmother gives her 30 dolls.
3) Over the year, Peggy receives half the amount of dolls that her grandmother gave her, which is 30 / 2 = 15 dolls.
4) To calculate the total number of dolls Peggy now has, we add up the initial 6 dolls, the 30 dolls from her grandmother, and the 15 dolls she received over the year:
6 + 30 + 15 = 51 dolls.

Answer: 51
