Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The initial thickness of the blanket is 3 inches.
2) Each time Janet folds the blanket, its thickness doubles.
3) We want to find the thickness after 4 foldings.
4) After the first folding, the thickness will be 3 inches x 2 = 6 inches.
5) After the second folding, the thickness will be 6 inches x 2 = 12 inches.
6) After the third folding, the thickness will be 12 inches x 2 = 24 inches.
7) After the fourth folding, the thickness will be 24 inches x 2 = 48 inches.

Answer: 48 inches
