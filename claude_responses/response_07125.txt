Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pete owes $90 on the bike
* He has two $20 bills, which is $40
* He has four $10 bills, which is $40
* So the total amount of cash he has is $40 + $40 = $80
* He is still short $90 - $80 = $10
* The store pays 50 cents for each bottle
* To get the $10 he needs, he will have to return enough bottles to get $10
* To calculate the number of bottles, we divide $10 by 50 cents per bottle
* $10 / $0.50 = 20 bottles

Answer: 20
