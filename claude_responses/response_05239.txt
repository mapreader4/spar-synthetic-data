Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Uncle Lou was given 4 bags of peanuts
* Each bag contains 30 peanuts
* So the total number of peanuts is 4 * 30 = 120 peanuts
* The flight is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes
* If he eats all the peanuts during the flight, one at a time, consumed at equally spaced intervals, then the time between eating each peanut is the total flight time divided by the total number of peanuts.
* 120 minutes / 120 peanuts = 1 minute per peanut

Answer: 1 minute
