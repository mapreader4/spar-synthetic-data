Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Heath planted 400 rows of carrots
* Each row had 300 plants
* So, the total number of carrots planted is 400 rows x 300 plants per row = 120,000 carrots
* He spent 20 hours planting the carrots
* To find the number of carrots he planted per hour, we divide the total number of carrots by the number of hours:
* 120,000 carrots / 20 hours = 6,000 carrots per hour

Answer: 6,000
