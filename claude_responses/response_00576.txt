Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile
* Cecile bought 15 apples
* To find the total number of apples they bought, we need to add Cecile's apples and Diane's apples

First, let's find out how many apples Diane bought:
* Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile
* Cecile bought 15 apples
* So, Diane bought 15 + 20 = 35 apples

Now, we can find the total number of apples they bought:
* Cecile bought 15 apples
* Diane bought 35 apples
* Total apples = 15 + 35 = 50 apples

Answer: 50
