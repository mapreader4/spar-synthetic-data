Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The lorry weighs 500 pounds when empty.
2) The lorry is loaded with 20 bags of apples.
3) Each bag of apples weighs 60 pounds.
4) To calculate the total weight of the loaded lorry, we need to add the weight of the empty lorry (500 pounds) to the weight of the 20 bags of apples.
5) The weight of the 20 bags of apples is 20 * 60 = 1200 pounds.
6) Therefore, the total weight of the loaded lorry is 500 + 1200 = 1700 pounds.

Answer: 1700
