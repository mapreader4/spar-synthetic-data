Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marcy has a 2-liter bottle of water
* Each sip is 40 ml
* She takes a sip every 5 minutes

First, we need to convert the 2-liter bottle to milliliters (ml):
* 2 liters = 2000 ml

Next, we need to calculate how many sips it will take to drink the entire 2000 ml bottle:
* 2000 ml / 40 ml per sip = 50 sips

Now, we need to calculate how long it will take Marcy to take 50 sips, given that she takes a sip every 5 minutes:
* 50 sips x 5 minutes per sip = 250 minutes

Answer: 250 minutes
