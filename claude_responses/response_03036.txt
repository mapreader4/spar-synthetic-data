Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lovely has 10 books in total.
2) Two-fifths of the books can be sold for $2.50 each.
3) To calculate two-fifths of 10 books, we can do: 2/5 * 10 = 4 books.
4) So 4 books can be sold for $2.50 each.
5) The remaining 6 books can be sold for $2 each.
6) For the 4 books sold at $2.50 each, the total earnings would be: 4 * $2.50 = $10.
7) For the 6 books sold at $2 each, the total earnings would be: 6 * $2 = $12.
8) The total earnings from selling all 10 books would be the sum of the earnings from the two groups: $10 + $12 = $22.

Answer: $22
