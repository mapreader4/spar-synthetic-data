Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenna needs to make an overskirt and two petticoats
* Each skirt uses a rectangle of material that measures 12 feet by 4 feet
* The area of each skirt is 12 feet x 4 feet = 48 square feet
* She needs to make 3 skirts, so the total area of the skirts is 3 x 48 square feet = 144 square feet
* She also needs to make a bodice that uses 2 square feet of material for the shirt and 5 square feet of fabric for each of the sleeves
* The total area for the bodice is 2 square feet + (2 x 5 square feet) = 12 square feet
* The total area of material needed is 144 square feet + 12 square feet = 156 square feet
* The material costs $3 per square foot
* So the total cost of the material is 156 square feet x $3 per square foot = $468

Answer: $468
