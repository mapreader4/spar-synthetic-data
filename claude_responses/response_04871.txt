Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mrs. Fredrickson has 80 chickens in total.
2) 1/4 of the 80 chickens are roosters. To find the number of roosters, we take 1/4 of 80, which is 20 roosters.
3) The remaining 60 chickens are hens (80 - 20 = 60).
4) Only three-fourths of the 60 hens lay eggs. To find the number of hens that lay eggs, we take 3/4 of 60, which is 45 hens that lay eggs.
5) The remaining 15 hens (60 - 45 = 15) do not lay eggs.
6) In total, the number of chickens that do not lay eggs is the 20 roosters plus the 15 hens that do not lay eggs, which is 35 chickens.

Answer: 35
