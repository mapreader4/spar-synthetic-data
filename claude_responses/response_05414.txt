Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peter has to walk a total of 2.5 miles to get to the grocery store
* He has already walked 1 mile
* So, he has 1.5 miles left to walk
* It takes him 20 minutes to walk 1 mile
* Therefore, to walk the remaining 1.5 miles, it will take him:
* 1.5 miles x 20 minutes/mile = 30 minutes
