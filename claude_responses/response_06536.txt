Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first game, 20 fewer people watched than the second game, which had 80 people.
* So, the first game had 80 - 20 = 60 people.
* In the third game, 15 more people watched than the second game, which had 80 people.
* So, the third game had 80 + 15 = 95 people.
* The total number of people who watched the games this week is 60 + 80 + 95 = 235.
* The total number of people who watched the games last week was 200.
* The difference between the number of people who watched the games this week and last week is 235 - 200 = 35.

Answer: 35
