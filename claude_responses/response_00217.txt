Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) When Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude.
2) We know that Maude will be 8 years old.
3) So if Emile is six times as old as Maude, and Maude is 8 years old, then Emile will be 6 * 8 = 48 years old.
4) And if Anne is two times as old as Emile, and Emile is 48 years old, then Anne will be 2 * 48 = 96 years old.

Answer: 96
