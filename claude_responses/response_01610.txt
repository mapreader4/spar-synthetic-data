Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Micah drank 1.5 liters of water in the morning.
* In the afternoon, she drank three times as much water as she did in the morning.
* To calculate the amount of water she drank in the afternoon, we multiply the amount she drank in the morning by 3:
  * 1.5 liters x 3 = 4.5 liters
* To calculate the total amount of water Micah drank from the morning until the afternoon, we add the amount she drank in the morning to the amount she drank in the afternoon:
  * 1.5 liters + 4.5 liters = 6 liters

Answer: 6 liters
