Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 lions and 2 rhinos that escaped from the zoo
* It takes 2 hours to recover each animal
* To find the total time spent recovering the animals, we need to add up the time for each animal

First, let's calculate the time for the lions:
* 3 lions x 2 hours per lion = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time for the rhinos:
* 2 rhinos x 2 hours per rhino = 4 hours

Now, we add the time for the lions and the rhinos:
* 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

Answer: 10 hours
