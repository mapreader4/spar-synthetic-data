Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that the jar has 14 blue jellybeans, 26 purple jellybeans, and 40 orange jellybeans.
2) We are also told that the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 200.
3) To find the number of red jellybeans, we need to subtract the number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.
4) The total number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans is 14 + 26 + 40 = 80.
5) Subtracting 80 from the total of 200 jellybeans, we get 200 - 80 = 120.

Answer: 120
