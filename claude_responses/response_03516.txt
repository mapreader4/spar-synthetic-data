Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The class needs to contribute $90 for the school activity
* The class has $14 in class funds
* The remaining amount needs to be divided among 19 students

First, we need to calculate the remaining amount that needs to be contributed:
* Total contribution required: $90
* Class funds available: $14
* Remaining amount to be contributed: $90 - $14 = $76

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount of $76 among the 19 students:
* Remaining amount: $76
* Number of students: 19
* Amount each student needs to contribute: $76 / 19 = $4

Therefore, each student will need to contribute $4.
