Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Tony has the following ropes:
   - 8-foot rope
   - 20-foot rope
   - Three 2-foot ropes (6 feet total)
   - 7-foot rope
2) To make the longest rope, he will need to tie all these ropes together.
3) Each knot between the ropes causes him to lose 1.2 feet.
4) The total length of the ropes is 8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41 feet.
5) He will need to tie 4 knots to connect all the ropes.
6) The total length lost due to the knots is 4 * 1.2 = 4.8 feet.
7) The final length of the rope is 41 feet - 4.8 feet = 36.2 feet.
