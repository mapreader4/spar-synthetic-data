Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Palmer originally had 100 photos under her bed
* In the first week, she took 50 new photos
* In the second week, she took twice as many photos as the first week, which is 2 x 50 = 100 new photos
* In the third and fourth weeks, she took a total of 80 new photos
* To find the total number of photos she has now, we add up the original 100 photos and the new photos from Bali:
* Original photos: 100
* Photos from first week: 50
* Photos from second week: 100
* Photos from third and fourth weeks: 80
* Total photos = 100 + 50 + 100 + 80 = 330

Answer: 330
