Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) It takes 50 large jelly beans to fill up a large drinking glass.
2) It takes half that amount, which is 25 jelly beans, to fill up a small drinking glass.
3) There are 5 large drinking glasses and 3 small drinking glasses.
4) To fill up the 5 large drinking glasses, it will take 5 * 50 = 250 large jelly beans.
5) To fill up the 3 small drinking glasses, it will take 3 * 25 = 75 jelly beans.
6) The total number of jelly beans required is the sum of the large and small glasses:
250 + 75 = 325 jelly beans.

Answer: 325
