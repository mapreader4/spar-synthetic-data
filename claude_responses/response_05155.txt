Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 forks in the cutlery drawer.
* There are 9 more knives than forks, so the number of knives is 6 + 9 = 15.
* There are twice as many spoons as knives, so the number of spoons is 2 x 15 = 30.
* There are half as many teaspoons as forks, so the number of teaspoons is 6 / 2 = 3.
* After 2 of each cutlery is added to the drawer, the new totals are:
    - Forks: 6 + 2 = 8
    - Knives: 15 + 2 = 17
    - Spoons: 30 + 2 = 32
    - Teaspoons: 3 + 2 = 5
* Adding up all the pieces of cutlery, the total is:
    - 8 forks + 17 knives + 32 spoons + 5 teaspoons = 62 pieces of cutlery

Answer: 62
