Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The factory made 320 caps the first week, 400 caps the second week, and 300 caps the third week.
2) To find the average number of caps made per week, we add up the number of caps made in the first 3 weeks and divide by 3:
   (320 + 400 + 300) / 3 = 1020 / 3 = 340 caps per week on average.
3) If the company makes their average number of caps from the first 3 weeks during the fourth week, they will make 340 caps.
4) To find the total number of caps made, we add up the caps made in the first 3 weeks and the 4th week:
   320 + 400 + 300 + 340 = 1360 total caps.

Answer: 1360
