Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We are given that Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank.
2) We are also given that the current total of their ages is 17.
3) Let's represent Frank's age as x.
4) Since Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank, Gabriel's age can be represented as x - 3.
5) The total of their ages is 17, so we can write the equation:
   x + (x - 3) = 17
6) Simplifying the equation:
   2x - 3 = 17
7) Adding 3 to both sides:
   2x = 20
8) Dividing both sides by 2:
   x = 10
9) Therefore, Frank's age is 10.

Answer: 10
