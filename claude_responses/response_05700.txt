Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Initially, there were 200 people at the town hall.
* 100 people decided to have a snack.
* Then, 20 new outsiders joined in to have a snack, so the total number of snack eaters is now 100 + 20 = 120.
* Half of these snack eaters got full and left, so the number of snack eaters is now 120 / 2 = 60.
* 10 new outsiders came to have snacks, so the total number of snack eaters is now 60 + 10 = 70.
* 30 more snack eaters got their fill and left, so the number of snack eaters is now 70 - 30 = 40.
* Finally, half of the remaining snack eaters left later on, so the number of snack eaters left is 40 / 2 = 20.

Answer: 20
