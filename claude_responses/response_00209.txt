Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 coaster vans used to transport the students
* Each van carries 28 students
* So the total number of students transported is:
  * 5 vans x 28 students per van = 140 students
* We are told that 60 of the students are boys
* To find the number of girls, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
  * 140 students - 60 boys = 80 girls

Answer: 80
