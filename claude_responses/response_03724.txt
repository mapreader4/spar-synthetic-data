Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bruce received $75 from his aunt
* Bruce received $150 from his grandfather
* So the total amount of money Bruce received for his birthday is $75 + $150 = $225
* Bruce wants to put one-fifth of the money he got for his birthday in the bank
* To calculate one-fifth of $225, we divide $225 by 5:
* $225 / 5 = $45

Answer: $45
