Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first ball is half the size of the second ball
* The third ball is three times as large as the first ball
* The third ball used 27 feet of yarn

First, we can find the size of the first ball:
* The third ball is three times as large as the first ball
* So, the first ball used 1/3 of the 27 feet of yarn used for the third ball
* 27 feet / 3 = 9 feet of yarn used for the first ball

Next, we can find the size of the second ball:
* The first ball is half the size of the second ball
* So, the second ball used 2 times the amount of yarn as the first ball
* 9 feet x 2 = 18 feet of yarn used for the second ball

Answer: 18 feet
