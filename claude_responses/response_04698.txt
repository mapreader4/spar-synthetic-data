Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Andrew's father buys a package of 100 masks
* Andrew lives with 2 parents and 2 siblings, so there are 5 people in the family
* Each member of the family changes masks every 4 days
* To find how many days it will take to finish the pack of 100 masks, we need to calculate how many mask changes will occur in total

First, let's calculate the number of mask changes per day:
* 5 people in the family
* Each person changes masks every 4 days
* So, there are 5 / 4 = 1.25 mask changes per day

Now, let's calculate the total number of mask changes until the pack is finished:
* 100 masks in the pack
* 1.25 mask changes per day
* 100 / 1.25 = 80 days

Therefore, it will take 80 days to finish the pack of 100 masks.

Answer: 80
