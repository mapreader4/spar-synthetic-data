Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John can read a book 60% faster than his brother.
2) His brother takes 8 hours to read a book.
3) We want to find how long it would take John to read 3 books.

First, let's calculate how long it takes John to read one book:
* If his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, and John is 60% faster, that means John takes 40% less time to read a book.
* 40% of 8 hours is 3.2 hours.
* So, John takes 8 hours - 3.2 hours = 4.8 hours to read one book.

Now, to find how long it takes John to read 3 books:
* John takes 4.8 hours to read one book.
* To read 3 books, it would take John 3 * 4.8 hours = 14.4 hours.

Answer: 14 hours.
