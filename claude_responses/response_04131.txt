Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill's take-home salary is $40,000
* He pays $2,000 in property taxes
* He pays $3,000 in sales taxes
* He pays 10% of his gross salary in income taxes

To find his gross salary, we need to work backwards from his take-home salary.

First, we need to calculate the income taxes he pays:
* 10% of his gross salary = income taxes
* Let's call his gross salary 'x'
* Income taxes = 0.10 * x = $4,000

Now we can calculate his total deductions:
* Property taxes = $2,000
* Sales taxes = $3,000
* Income taxes = $4,000
* Total deductions = $2,000 + $3,000 + $4,000 = $9,000

Finally, we can calculate his gross salary:
* Take-home salary = Gross salary - Total deductions
* $40,000 = Gross salary - $9,000
* Gross salary = $40,000 + $9,000 = $49,000

Answer: $49,000
