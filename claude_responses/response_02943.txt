Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerry finds the thermostat set to 40 degrees.
2) Jerry sets the thermostat to double the initial temperature, which is 40 x 2 = 80 degrees.
3) Jerry's dad notices and reduces the temperature by 30 degrees, so the temperature is now 80 - 30 = 50 degrees.
4) Jerry's mother then reduces the temperature by 30%, which is 50 x 0.7 = 35 degrees.
5) Finally, Jerry's sister increases the temperature by 24 degrees, so the final temperature is 35 + 24 = 59 degrees.

Answer: 59 degrees.
