Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The train comes every 5 minutes, so there are 12 trains in an hour (60 minutes / 5 minutes per train = 12 trains).
2) Each train leaves with 200 passengers and takes on 320 passengers.
3) To find the total number of different passengers, we need to add up the number of passengers leaving and the number of passengers boarding for all 12 trains.
4) Passengers leaving: 200 passengers per train x 12 trains = 2,400 passengers
5) Passengers boarding: 320 passengers per train x 12 trains = 3,840 passengers
6) Total different passengers = Passengers leaving + Passengers boarding = 2,400 + 3,840 = 6,240 passengers.

Answer: 6,240
