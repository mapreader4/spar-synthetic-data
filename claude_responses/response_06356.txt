Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Morgan orders a hamburger for $4, onion rings for $2, and a smoothie for $3.
2) To calculate the total cost of his order, we add up the individual costs:
   $4 (hamburger) + $2 (onion rings) + $3 (smoothie) = $9 total
3) Morgan pays with a $20 bill.
4) To calculate the change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
   $20 (amount paid) - $9 (total cost) = $11 change
