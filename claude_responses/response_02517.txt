Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mrs. Choi purchased the house for $80,000.
2) Five years later, she sold the house for a 20% profit.
3) To calculate the selling price, we need to find 20% of the original price ($80,000) and add it to the original price.
4) 20% of $80,000 is $16,000.
5) $80,000 + $16,000 = $96,000.
6) However, Mrs. Choi also had to pay a 5% broker's commission from the original price.
7) 5% of $80,000 is $4,000.
8) So the final selling price is $96,000 - $4,000 = $92,000.

Answer: $92,000
