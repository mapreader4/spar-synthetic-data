Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joey plans to mow 3 neighbors' lawns for $8 each, so his earnings from that will be:
3 lawns x $8 per lawn = $24
* He also plans to sell 2 collectible figures for $9 each, so his earnings from that will be:
2 figures x $9 per figure = $18
* Finally, he plans to work an after-school job for 10 hours at $5 per hour, so his earnings from that will be:
10 hours x $5 per hour = $50
* Now, we add up all of his earnings:
$24 + $18 + $50 = $92
* The question states that his earnings "just cover the price of the High Jump sneakers", so the cost of the sneakers must be $92.

Answer: 92
