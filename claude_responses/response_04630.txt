Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 models in the show
* Each model will wear 2 sets of bathing suits and 3 sets of evening wear
* It takes 2 minutes for a model to walk out to the end of the runway and back
* Models take turns, one at a time, walking the runway

First, let's calculate the total number of runway trips:
* Each model will have 2 bathing suit trips and 3 evening wear trips
* 2 bathing suit trips + 3 evening wear trips = 5 trips per model
* With 6 models, that's a total of 6 * 5 = 30 runway trips

Now, we know that each runway trip takes 2 minutes, so:
* 30 runway trips * 2 minutes per trip = 60 minutes

Therefore, the total time to complete all of the runway trips during the show is:

Answer: 60 minutes
