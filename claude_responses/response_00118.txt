Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeanette starts out juggling 3 objects
* Each week, she can juggle 2 more objects than the week before
* She practices for 5 weeks

So, we can calculate the number of objects she can juggle each week:
* Week 1: 3 objects
* Week 2: 3 + 2 = 5 objects
* Week 3: 5 + 2 = 7 objects
* Week 4: 7 + 2 = 9 objects
* Week 5: 9 + 2 = 11 objects

Therefore, after 5 weeks of practice, Jeanette can juggle 11 objects.

Answer: 11
