Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lefty scores 20 points
* Righty scores half as many as Lefty, so Righty scores 20 / 2 = 10 points
* The other teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty, so the other teammate scores 10 * 6 = 60 points
* The total points scored by the team is 20 + 10 + 60 = 90 points
* There are 3 players on the team
* To find the average points scored per player, we divide the total points by the number of players:
* 90 points / 3 players = 30 points per player on average

Answer: 30
