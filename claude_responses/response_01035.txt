Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know the difference between the number of boys and girls is 400.
2) We also know that there are 600 boys at the event.
3) Since the number of girls is more than the number of boys, we can say that the number of girls is 600 + 400 = 1000.
4) The total number of boys and girls at the event is 600 + 1000 = 1600.
5) 60% of the total number of boys and girls is 0.6 * 1600 = 960.

Answer: 960
