Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 5 advertisements shown during the race
* Each advertisement lasted 3 minutes
* So the total duration of the advertisements was 5 advertisements x 3 minutes per advertisement = 15 minutes
* The cost of 1 minute of advertising is $4000
* Therefore, the total cost of transmitting the advertisements during the race was 15 minutes x $4000 per minute = $60,000

Answer: $60,000
