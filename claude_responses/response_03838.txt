Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kim orders a $10 meal and a drink for $2.5, so the total cost of the order is $10 + $2.5 = $12.5
2) She gives a 20% tip, which means the tip amount is 20% of $12.5, which is 0.2 * $12.5 = $2.5
3) The total amount Kim pays is the cost of the order ($12.5) plus the tip ($2.5), which is $12.5 + $2.5 = $15
4) Kim pays with a $20 bill, so the change she receives is $20 - $15 = $5
Answer: $5
