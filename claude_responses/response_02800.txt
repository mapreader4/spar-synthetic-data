Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) In the second grade, there are 20 boys and 11 girls, for a total of 20 + 11 = 31 students.

2) In the third grade, there are twice as many students as in the second grade. So, the number of students in the third grade is 2 x 31 = 62.

3) To find the total number of students in grades 2 and 3, we add the number of students in each grade:
   31 (second grade) + 62 (third grade) = 93 students.

Answer: 93
