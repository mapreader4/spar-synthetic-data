Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The plumber bought 10 meters of copper pipe.
2) The plumber also bought 5 more meters of plastic pipe.
3) Each meter of pipe, whether copper or plastic, cost $4.
4) To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of meters of each type of pipe by the cost per meter.
5) For the copper pipe, the cost is 10 meters x $4 per meter = $40.
6) For the plastic pipe, the cost is 5 meters x $4 per meter = $20.
7) To get the total cost, we add the cost of the copper pipe and the plastic pipe:
$40 + $20 = $60.

Answer: 60
