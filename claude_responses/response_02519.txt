Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The sneakers cost $90
* Lee already has $15 saved
* He plans to sell 10 action figures to make the rest
* After buying the sneakers, he has $25 left

First, we need to calculate how much money Lee needs to make from selling the action figures:
* Cost of sneakers: $90
* Amount Lee already has: $15
* Amount needed from selling action figures: $90 - $15 = $75

Now, we know that Lee has $25 left after buying the sneakers, so we can calculate the total amount he made from selling the action figures:
* Total amount made from selling action figures: $75 + $25 = $100

Finally, we can calculate the amount he charged per action figure:
* Number of action figures sold: 10
* Amount charged per action figure: $100 / 10 = $10

Answer: $10
