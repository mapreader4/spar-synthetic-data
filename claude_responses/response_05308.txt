Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Trace has 5 shopping bags that weigh the same amount as Gordon's 2 shopping bags.
2) One of Gordon's shopping bags weighs 3 pounds, and the other weighs 7 pounds.
3) So the total weight of Gordon's 2 shopping bags is 3 + 7 = 10 pounds.
4) Since Trace's 5 bags weigh the same as Gordon's 2 bags, the total weight of Trace's 5 bags is also 10 pounds.
5) Since Trace's 5 bags weigh the same amount, we can divide the total weight (10 pounds) by the number of bags (5) to get the weight of one of Trace's bags.
6) 10 pounds / 5 bags = 2 pounds per bag.

Answer: 2 pounds
