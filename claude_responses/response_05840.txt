Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Phil initially had 10 books
* Each book is 100 pages
* So the total number of pages in the 10 books is:
  * 10 books x 100 pages per book = 1,000 pages
* During the move, 2 books were lost
* So the number of books Phil has left is:
  * 10 books - 2 lost books = 8 books
* Therefore, the total number of pages in the 8 books Phil has left is:
  * 8 books x 100 pages per book = 800 pages

Answer: 800
