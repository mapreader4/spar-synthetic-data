Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John scores 2 shots worth 2 points and 1 shot worth 3 points every 4 minutes
* Each period is 12 minutes
* He plays for 2 periods

First, let's calculate how many sets of 4 minutes are in 12 minutes:
* 12 minutes / 4 minutes per set = 3 sets per period

Now, let's calculate the points scored per period:
* 2 shots worth 2 points each = 4 points
* 1 shot worth 3 points = 3 points
* Total points per 4 minute set = 4 + 3 = 7 points
* Points scored per period = 7 points x 3 sets = 21 points

Finally, since he plays for 2 periods, the total points scored is:
* 21 points per period x 2 periods = 42 points

Answer: 42
