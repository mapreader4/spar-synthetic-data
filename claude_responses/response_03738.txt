Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Julieta originally planned to buy:
   - 1 backpack at $50
   - 3 ring-binders at $20 each
2. The original total cost would have been:
   - Backpack: $50
   - 3 ring-binders: 3 x $20 = $60
   - Total: $50 + $60 = $110
3. However, the prices changed:
   - Backpack price increased by $5, so now it costs $50 + $5 = $55
   - Ring-binder price decreased by $2, so now it costs $20 - $2 = $18 each
4. With the new prices, the total cost would be:
   - Backpack: $55
   - 3 ring-binders: 3 x $18 = $54
   - Total: $55 + $54 = $109

Answer: 109
