Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Tuesday, 12,000 ice cream cones were sold.
* On Wednesday, the number of ice cream cones sold was double the amount sold on Tuesday.
* To find the number of ice cream cones sold on Wednesday, we take the amount sold on Tuesday (12,000) and double it:
* 12,000 x 2 = 24,000 ice cream cones sold on Wednesday.
* To find the total number of ice cream cones sold, we add the amounts sold on Tuesday and Wednesday:
* 12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 ice cream cones sold in total.

Answer: 36,000
