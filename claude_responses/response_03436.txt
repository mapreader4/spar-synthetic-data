Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Cristine bought a dozen lemons, which is 12 lemons.
2) She gave 1/4 of the lemons to her neighbor.
3) To find how many lemons she gave to her neighbor, we take 1/4 of 12 lemons:
1/4 of 12 = 12 / 4 = 3 lemons.
4) To find how many lemons Cristine has left, we subtract the number of lemons she gave to her neighbor from the total number of lemons she bought:
12 lemons - 3 lemons = 9 lemons.

Answer: 9
