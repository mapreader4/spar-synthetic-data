Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Miss Darlington has a basket of 20 blueberries.
2) She picked 9 more baskets with the same amount of berries.
3) To find the total number of blueberries, we need to add the number of blueberries in the first basket to the number of blueberries in the 9 additional baskets.
4) The first basket has 20 blueberries.
5) Each of the 9 additional baskets also has 20 blueberries.
6) So the total number of blueberries is 20 + (9 x 20) = 20 + 180 = 200.

Answer: 200
