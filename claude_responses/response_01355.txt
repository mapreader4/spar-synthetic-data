Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Jones has 6 shirts for every pair of pants
* He has 40 pants
* To find the total number of pieces of clothes he owns, we need to calculate the number of shirts and the number of pants, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of shirts:
* He has 6 shirts for every pair of pants
* He has 40 pants
* So, the number of shirts he has is 6 x 40 = 240 shirts

Now, let's find the total number of pieces of clothes:
* He has 40 pants
* He has 240 shirts
* The total number of pieces of clothes is 40 + 240 = 280

Answer: 280
