Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Meghan had 2 $100 bills
* Each $100 bill is worth $100
* So, the value of the 2 $100 bills is 2 x $100 = $200

* Meghan had 5 $50 bills
* Each $50 bill is worth $50
* So, the value of the 5 $50 bills is 5 x $50 = $250

* Meghan had 10 $10 bills
* Each $10 bill is worth $10
* So, the value of the 10 $10 bills is 10 x $10 = $100

* To calculate the total amount of money Meghan had, we add up the values of the different denominations:
* $200 + $250 + $100 = $550

Answer: 550
