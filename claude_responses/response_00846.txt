Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kurt's old refrigerator cost $0.85 per day in electricity
* The new energy-efficient refrigerator costs $0.45 per day in electricity
* We want to calculate the savings in a 30-day month

To calculate the savings, we need to find the difference in cost between the old and new refrigerators over the 30-day period.

Cost of old refrigerator over 30 days:
* $0.85 per day x 30 days = $25.50

Cost of new refrigerator over 30 days:
* $0.45 per day x 30 days = $13.50

Savings:
* $25.50 - $13.50 = $12.00

Answer: $12
