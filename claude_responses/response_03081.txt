Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The pea patch is twice as big as the radish patch.
2) One sixth of the pea patch is 5 square feet.
3) To find the total size of the pea patch, we need to multiply 5 square feet by 6 (since one sixth is 5 square feet).
4) 5 square feet x 6 = 30 square feet, which is the total size of the pea patch.
5) Since the pea patch is twice as big as the radish patch, the radish patch must be half the size of the pea patch.
6) 30 square feet / 2 = 15 square feet, which is the total size of the radish patch.

Answer: 15 square feet.
