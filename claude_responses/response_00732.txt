Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A tarantula has 8 legs
* One tarantula egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas
* The question asks for the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs

First, let's calculate the number of baby tarantulas in 4 egg sacs:
* 4 egg sacs x 1000 tarantulas per sac = 4000 baby tarantulas

Now, we can calculate the total number of baby tarantula legs:
* 4000 baby tarantulas x 8 legs per tarantula = 32,000 baby tarantula legs

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 32,000
