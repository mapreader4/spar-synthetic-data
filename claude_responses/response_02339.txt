Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hazel received 6 shirts.
2) Razel received twice the number of shirts as Hazel, which means Razel received 2 x 6 = 12 shirts.
3) Hazel and Razel share everything they receive, so the total number of shirts they have is the sum of the shirts they each received.
4) The total number of shirts they have is 6 + 12 = 18 shirts.

Answer: 18
