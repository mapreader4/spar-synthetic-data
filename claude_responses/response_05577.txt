Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The 24oz barrel has 60 servings
* Each serving has 12 cheese balls
* So, the total number of cheese balls in the 24oz barrel is:
    - 60 servings x 12 cheese balls per serving = 720 cheese balls
* The question states that the 35oz barrel is being asked about
* To find the number of cheese balls in the 35oz barrel, we need to set up a proportion:
    - 24oz barrel has 720 cheese balls
    - 35oz barrel has x cheese balls
    - 24/720 = 35/x
    - Solving for x, we get:
        x = (35 * 720) / 24 = 1,050 cheese balls

Answer: 1,050 cheese balls
