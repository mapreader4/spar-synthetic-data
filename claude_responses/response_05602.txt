Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carmen originally had 28 cats and 18 dogs.
2) She gave up 3 of the cats for adoption.
3) So, the number of cats she has now is 28 - 3 = 25 cats.
4) The number of dogs she has is still 18.
5) To find the difference between the number of cats and dogs, we subtract the number of dogs from the number of cats.
6) 25 cats - 18 dogs = 7 more cats than dogs.
