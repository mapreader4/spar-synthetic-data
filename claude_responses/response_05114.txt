Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jaron needs 2000 points to win the Nintendo Switch
* He has already sold 8 chocolate bunnies that are worth 100 points each
* So the points he has already earned from the chocolate bunnies is:
    - 8 bunnies x 100 points per bunny = 800 points
* Now, he needs to earn the remaining points through selling Snickers bars
* Each Snickers bar earns 25 points
* To calculate how many Snickers bars he needs to sell, we take the remaining points needed (2000 - 800 = 1200) and divide it by the points per Snickers bar (25)
* 1200 points / 25 points per Snickers bar = 48 Snickers bars

Answer: 48 Snickers bars
