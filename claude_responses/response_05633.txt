Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Thomas has a total of 25 drawings to display
* 14 of the drawings were made using colored pencils
* 7 of the drawings were made using blending markers
* The rest of the drawings were made with charcoal
* To find the number of charcoal drawings, we need to subtract the number of colored pencil drawings and blending marker drawings from the total number of drawings
* 14 colored pencil drawings + 7 blending marker drawings = 21 drawings
* 25 total drawings - 21 drawings = 4 charcoal drawings
