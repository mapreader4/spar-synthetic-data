Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Galileo is currently renting a car that costs $20 per month
* He is planning to buy a brand new car that costs $30 per month
* He will have to pay for the new car for a year

To calculate the difference, we need to find the total cost of renting the car for a year and the total cost of buying the new car for a year, then find the difference.

Renting the car for a year:
* $20 per month x 12 months = $240

Buying the new car for a year:
* $30 per month x 12 months = $360

Difference:
* $360 (buying the new car) - $240 (renting the car) = $120

Answer: $120
