Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gloria has five times as many dimes as quarters in her graduation money.
2) This means that if she has 350 dimes, then the number of quarters she has is 350 / 5 = 70 quarters.
3) She decides to put 2/5 of the quarters aside for future use. This means she is putting aside 2/5 * 70 = 28 quarters.
4) After putting aside 28 quarters, she has 70 - 28 = 42 quarters remaining.
5) The combined number of quarters and dimes she has after putting aside 2/5 of the quarters is 42 quarters + 350 dimes = 392.

Answer: 392
