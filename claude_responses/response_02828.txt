Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adam originally had 18 magnets.
2) He gave away a third of the magnets. To find how many he gave away, we take one-third of 18, which is 6.
3) So Adam had 18 - 6 = 12 magnets left.
4) We are told that Adam still had half as many magnets as Peter. So if Adam had 12 magnets, Peter must have had 2 * 12 = 24 magnets.

Answer: 24
