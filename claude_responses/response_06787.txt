Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Koby has 2 boxes of fireworks
* Each of Koby's boxes contains 3 sparklers and 5 whistlers
* So, Koby has a total of 2 * 3 = 6 sparklers and 2 * 5 = 10 whistlers
* Cherie has 1 box of fireworks
* Cherie's box contains 8 sparklers and 9 whistlers
* So, Cherie has a total of 8 sparklers and 9 whistlers
* To find the total number of fireworks, we add up Koby's and Cherie's fireworks:
* Total sparklers = 6 + 8 = 14
* Total whistlers = 10 + 9 = 19
* Total fireworks = 14 + 19 = 33

Answer: 33
