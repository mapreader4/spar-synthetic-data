Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill
* Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth to climb the hill
* To find how long it takes Tom to climb the hill, we need to multiply Elizabeth's time by 4
* Elizabeth's time is 30 minutes
* 30 minutes x 4 = 120 minutes
* To convert 120 minutes to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour
* 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
