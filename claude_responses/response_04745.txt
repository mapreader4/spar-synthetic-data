Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerry has three times as many stickers as George.
2) George has 6 fewer stickers than his brother Fred.
3) Fred has 18 stickers.

So, we can start by finding out how many stickers George has:
* Fred has 18 stickers
* George has 6 fewer stickers than Fred
* Therefore, George has 18 - 6 = 12 stickers

Now, we can find out how many stickers Jerry has:
* Jerry has three times as many stickers as George
* George has 12 stickers
* Therefore, Jerry has 3 x 12 = 36 stickers

Answer: 36
