Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The plot of land is rectangular, with long sides and short sides.
2) The long sides are 3 times the length of the short sides.
3) The total length of all the sides of the fence is 640 feet.
4) One of the short sides of the fence needs to be replaced.
5) Let's call the length of the short sides 'x'.
6) Then the length of the long sides is 3x.
7) The total length of the fence is the sum of the two long sides and the two short sides:
2(3x) + 2x = 640
8(x) = 640
x = 80
9) Since one of the short sides is 80 feet, the length of fence that needs to be replaced is 80 feet.

Answer: 80 feet
