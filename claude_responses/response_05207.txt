Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kyla has 2 fewer bills than Jessa
* Geric has twice as many bills as Kyla
* Jessa has 7 bills left after giving 3 bills to Geric

First, let's find out how many bills Jessa had originally:
* Jessa has 7 bills left after giving 3 to Geric
* So Jessa originally had 7 + 3 = 10 bills

Next, we can find out how many bills Kyla had:
* Kyla has 2 fewer bills than Jessa
* So Kyla had 10 - 2 = 8 bills

Now, we can find out how many bills Geric had:
* Geric has twice as many bills as Kyla
* So Geric had 8 x 2 = 16 bills

Answer: 16
