Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We have a tree and Jane, both casting shadows.
2) The tree's shadow is 10 meters long.
3) Jane's shadow is 0.5 meters long.
4) Jane is 1.5 meters tall.
5) We can use similar triangles to find the height of the tree.
6) The ratio of the tree's height to the tree's shadow length is the same as the ratio of Jane's height to Jane's shadow length.
7) So, the tree's height divided by 10 meters is equal to 1.5 meters divided by 0.5 meters.
8) Solving for the tree's height, we get:
Tree's height = (1.5 meters / 0.5 meters) * 10 meters = 30 meters.

Answer: 30
