Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Natalie had $26 to go shopping.
2) She bought a jumper for $9.
3) She bought a T-shirt for $4.
4) She bought a pair of heels for $5.
5) To calculate the total amount she spent, we add up the costs of the items:
$9 + $4 + $5 = $18
6) To calculate the amount of money Natalie has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial $26:
$26 - $18 = $8
