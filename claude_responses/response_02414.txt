Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that Amanda can run 2000 meters in 2 hours.
2) This means her speed is 2000 meters / 2 hours = 1000 meters per hour.
3) We want to know how long it would take her to run 10000 meters at the same speed.
4) To calculate this, we divide the distance (10000 meters) by the speed (1000 meters per hour).
5) 10000 meters / 1000 meters per hour = 10 hours.

Answer: 10 hours.
