Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martine has 6 more than twice as many peaches as Benjy.
   * Let's call the number of peaches Benjy has as "x".
   * Then, Martine has 2x + 6 peaches.
2) We know that Martine has 16 peaches.
   * So, 2x + 6 = 16
   * Solving for x, we get x = 5.
3) Benjy has one-third as many peaches as Gabrielle.
   * Let's call the number of peaches Gabrielle has as "y".
   * Then, Benjy has y/3 peaches.
4) We know that Benjy has 5 peaches.
   * So, y/3 = 5
   * Solving for y, we get y = 15.

Answer: 15
