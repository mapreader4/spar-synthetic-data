Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carla is using 500 ml of watermelon puree
* She is also using 100 ml of cream
* The serving size for the smoothie is 150 ml
* To calculate the total volume of the smoothie, we add the watermelon puree and cream:
    - 500 ml + 100 ml = 600 ml
* To find the number of 150 ml servings, we divide the total volume by the serving size:
    - 600 ml / 150 ml = 4 servings
