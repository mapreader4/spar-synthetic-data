Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jim has a total of 301 model cars
2) Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords
   * Let's call the number of Fords 'x'
   * Then the number of Buicks is 4x
3) Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys
   * The number of Chevys is 2x - 3
4) Now we can set up an equation to solve for the number of Fords (x):
   * Total cars = Buicks + Fords + Chevys
   * 301 = 4x + x + 2x - 3
   * 301 = 7x - 3
   * 304 = 7x
   * x = 43 (the number of Fords)
5) Now we can calculate the number of Buicks:
   * Buicks = 4x = 4 * 43 = 172

Answer: 172
