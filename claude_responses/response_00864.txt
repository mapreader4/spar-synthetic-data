Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The coffee shop is open 5 hours a day, every single day
* On a weekday, the coffee shop brews 10 coffee cups per hour
* So on a weekday, the coffee shop brews 10 cups per hour x 5 hours = 50 coffee cups
* On the weekend, the coffee shop brews 120 coffee cups in total
* There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday)
* So on each weekend day, the coffee shop brews 120 / 2 = 60 coffee cups
* In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days
* So the total number of coffee cups brewed in a week is:
* (5 days x 50 cups per day) + (2 days x 60 cups per day) = 250 + 120 = 370 coffee cups

Answer: 370
