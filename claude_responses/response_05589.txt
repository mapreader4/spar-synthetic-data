Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael saved 5 cookies to give to Sarah
* Sarah saved a third of her 9 cupcakes to give to Michael
* To find how many cupcakes Sarah saved for Michael, we need to calculate a third of 9:
    - 1/3 of 9 = 3
* So Sarah saved 3 cupcakes to give to Michael
* Now, we need to find how many desserts Sarah ends up with
* Sarah started with 9 cupcakes
* She gave 3 cupcakes to Michael
* So the number of cupcakes Sarah ends up with is 9 - 3 = 6
