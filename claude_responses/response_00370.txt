Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nurse Missy has 12 patients in her ward
* One-third of the patients (1/3 of 12 = 4) have special dietary requirements
* The serving time for the special dietary patients is increased by 20%
* It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient

First, let's calculate the time it takes to serve the standard care patients:
* 12 patients - 4 special dietary patients = 8 standard care patients
* 8 standard care patients x 5 minutes per patient = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to serve the special dietary patients:
* The serving time for special dietary patients is increased by 20%
* 5 minutes per patient x 1.2 = 6 minutes per special dietary patient
* 4 special dietary patients x 6 minutes per patient = 24 minutes

Finally, we add the time for the standard care patients and the special dietary patients:
* 40 minutes + 24 minutes = 64 minutes

Answer: 64 minutes
