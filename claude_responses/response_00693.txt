Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ian had 20 roses initially
* He gave 6 roses to his mother
* He gave 9 roses to his grandmother
* He gave 4 roses to his sister
* To find the number of roses he kept, we need to subtract the number of roses he gave away from the total number of roses he had
* The number of roses he gave away is 6 + 9 + 4 = 19
* Therefore, the number of roses he kept is 20 - 19 = 1
