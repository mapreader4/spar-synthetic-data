Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeff has twice as many cars as trucks
* Let's represent the number of trucks as 'x'
* Then, the number of cars is '2x'
* The total number of vehicles is 60
* So, the total number of vehicles is the sum of the cars and trucks:
* 2x + x = 60
* 3x = 60
* x = 20

Therefore, the number of trucks Jeff has is:
Answer: 20
