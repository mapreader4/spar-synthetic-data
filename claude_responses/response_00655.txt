Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hawkeye has to charge his battery 4 times.
2) Each charge costs $3.5.
3) To calculate the total cost of the battery charges, we multiply the number of charges (4) by the cost per charge ($3.5):
   4 x $3.5 = $14
4) Hawkeye's battery charging budget was $20.
5) To calculate how much money he was left with, we subtract the total cost of the battery charges ($14) from his budget ($20):
   $20 - $14 = $6

Answer: $6
