Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Theon's ship can move 15 nautical miles per hour
* Yara's ship can move 30 nautical miles per hour
* The destination is 90 nautical miles away

To find how many hours ahead Yara will be, we need to calculate the time it takes for each ship to reach the destination.

For Theon's ship:
* Time taken = Distance / Speed
* Time taken = 90 nautical miles / 15 nautical miles per hour
* Time taken = 6 hours

For Yara's ship:
* Time taken = Distance / Speed
* Time taken = 90 nautical miles / 30 nautical miles per hour
* Time taken = 3 hours

Now, to find how many hours ahead Yara will be, we subtract the time taken by Yara's ship from the time taken by Theon's ship:
* Time difference = 6 hours - 3 hours
* Time difference = 3 hours
