Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A small pizza has 6 slices
* You ordered 4 small pizzas
* So, the number of slices from the small pizzas is: 4 x 6 = 24 slices

* A medium pizza has 8 slices
* You ordered 5 medium pizzas
* So, the number of slices from the medium pizzas is: 5 x 8 = 40 slices

* We don't know how many large pizzas you ordered, but we know the total number of pizzas is 15
* We can calculate the number of large pizzas by subtracting the small and medium pizzas from the total:
* 15 total pizzas - 4 small pizzas - 5 medium pizzas = 6 large pizzas

* A large pizza has 12 slices
* So, the number of slices from the large pizzas is: 6 x 12 = 72 slices

* To get the total number of slices, we add up the slices from the small, medium, and large pizzas:
* 24 + 40 + 72 = 136 slices

Answer: 136
