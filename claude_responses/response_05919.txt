Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janet spends 8 minutes every day looking for her keys
* She then spends another 3 minutes complaining after she finds them
* So, the total time she spends on this every day is 8 minutes + 3 minutes = 11 minutes
* There are 7 days in a week
* Therefore, the total time she spends on this every week is 11 minutes x 7 days = 77 minutes
* If Janet stops losing her keys, she will save 77 minutes every week.

Answer: 77
