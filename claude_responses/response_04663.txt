Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Deane decides to fill his gas tank with 10 liters of gas today
* The cost per liter of gas today is $1.4
* So, the cost for the 10 liters of gas today is:
10 liters x $1.4 per liter = $14
* On Friday, there is a $0.4 oil price rollback
* So, the new cost per liter of gas on Friday will be $1.4 - $0.4 = $1.0 per liter
* Mr. Deane decides to fill his gas tank with another 25 liters on Friday
* So, the cost for the 25 liters of gas on Friday is:
25 liters x $1.0 per liter = $25
* The total amount Mr. Deane will spend for his 35 liters of gas is:
$14 + $25 = $39
