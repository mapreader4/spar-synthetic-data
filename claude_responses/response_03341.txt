Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first week, there were 5000 new coronavirus cases recorded.

2. In the second week, half as many new cases were recorded compared to the first week. That means the number of new cases in the second week was 5000 / 2 = 2500.

3. In the third week, 2000 more cases were recorded compared to the second week. That means the number of new cases in the third week was 2500 + 2000 = 4500.

Now, to find the total number of recorded new coronavirus cases in the state after the three weeks, we add up the new cases from each week:

Total new cases = 5000 + 2500 + 4500 = 12000

Answer: 12000
