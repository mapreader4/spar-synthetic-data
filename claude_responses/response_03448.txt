Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barney owns 18 towels
* He uses 2 towels per day
* He washes his towels once a week
* He missed one week of laundry

First, let's calculate how many towels he used during the week he missed laundry:
* 2 towels per day x 7 days in a week = 14 towels used

Now, let's calculate how many clean towels he has left:
* 18 towels - 14 towels used = 4 clean towels

Since he uses 2 towels per day, the number of days he will not have clean towels is:
* 4 clean towels / 2 towels per day = 2 days

Answer: 2 days
