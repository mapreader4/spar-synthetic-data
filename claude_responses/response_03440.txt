Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mica bought 2 kilograms of pasta that costs $1.5 per kilogram.
   * 2 kilograms x $1.5 per kilogram = $3 for the pasta

2. Mica bought 1/4 kilogram of ground beef, which costs $8 per kilogram.
   * 1/4 kilogram x $8 per kilogram = $2 for the ground beef

3. Mica bought two jars of pasta sauce that cost $2 per jar.
   * 2 jars x $2 per jar = $4 for the pasta sauce

4. Mica also wants to buy a $6 Quesadilla for snacks.

Now, to calculate the total amount of money Mica should have with her:
* Total cost = $3 (pasta) + $2 (ground beef) + $4 (pasta sauce) + $6 (Quesadilla)
* Total cost = $15

Answer: $15
