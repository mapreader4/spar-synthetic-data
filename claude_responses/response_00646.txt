Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2) On the first trip from city A to city B, the bus carried 3/4 of its capacity.
   * 3/4 of 200 = 150 people
3) On the return trip from city B to city A, the bus carried 4/5 of its capacity.
   * 4/5 of 200 = 160 people
4) To find the total number of people the bus carried on the two trips, we add the number of people carried on the first trip and the number of people carried on the second trip.
   * 150 + 160 = 310 people

Answer: 310
