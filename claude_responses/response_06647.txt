To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cans collected yesterday and today, and then calculate the difference.

Yesterday's cans collected:
* Sarah collected 50 cans
* Lara collected 30 more cans than Sarah, which is 50 + 30 = 80 cans
* Total cans collected yesterday = 50 + 80 = 130 cans

Today's cans collected:
* Sarah collected 40 cans
* Lara collected 70 cans
* Total cans collected today = 40 + 70 = 110 cans

Difference in cans collected:
* Total cans collected yesterday - Total cans collected today = 130 - 110 = 20 cans

Answer: 20
