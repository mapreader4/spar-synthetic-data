Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Zander collected 100 stickers.
2) He gave some of his stickers to his two friends, Andrew and Bill.
3) Andrew received 1/5 of Zander's stickers.
   * To calculate how many stickers Andrew received, we take 1/5 of 100 stickers:
   * 1/5 of 100 = 100 * 1/5 = 20 stickers
4) After giving 20 stickers to Andrew, Zander had the remaining 80 stickers left.
5) Bill received 3/10 of the remaining 80 stickers.
   * To calculate how many stickers Bill received, we take 3/10 of 80 stickers:
   * 3/10 of 80 = 80 * 3/10 = 24 stickers
6) In total, Zander gave 20 stickers to Andrew and 24 stickers to Bill.
   * The total number of stickers Zander gave to his two friends is 20 + 24 = 44 stickers.

Answer: 44
