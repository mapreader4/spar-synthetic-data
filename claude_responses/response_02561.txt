Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Happy Island has 60 turtles.
2) The number of turtles on Happy Island is 10 more than 2 times the number of turtles on Lonely Island.
3) Let's represent the number of turtles on Lonely Island as x.
4) The number of turtles on Happy Island is 2x + 10.
5) We know that the number of turtles on Happy Island is 60, so we can set up an equation:
2x + 10 = 60
6) Solving for x, we get:
2x = 50
x = 25
Therefore, the number of turtles on Lonely Island is 25.
