Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sunnyvale School had 4.5 liters of orange punch.
2) They had twice as much cherry punch as orange punch. So, the amount of cherry punch is 2 x 4.5 = 9 liters.
3) They had 1.5 liters less of apple juice than cherry punch. So, the amount of apple juice is 9 - 1.5 = 7.5 liters.
4) To find the total amount of fruit punch, we add up the amounts of the three juices:
   4.5 liters of orange punch
   + 9 liters of cherry punch
   + 7.5 liters of apple juice
   = 21 liters of total fruit punch.
