Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The jar can fit 100 toenails in total
* The big toenails from Hilary's two big toes are twice as big as the regular toenails
* Hilary has already filled the jar with 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails
* To find how many more regular toenails can fit in the remainder of the jar, we need to:
1) Calculate the total space taken up by the 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails already in the jar:
   * 20 big toenails = 40 regular toenails (since big toenails are twice as big)
   * 40 regular toenails + 40 regular toenails = 80 regular toenails total
2) Subtract the 80 regular toenails already in the jar from the total capacity of 100 toenails:
   * 100 toenails - 80 toenails = 20 toenails remaining

Answer: 20 regular toenails can fit into the remainder of the jar.
