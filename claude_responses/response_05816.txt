Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that 8 movie tickets cost 2 times as much as 1 football game ticket.
2) Each movie ticket is sold at $30.
3) To find the cost of 1 football game ticket, we can use the following equation:
   8 * $30 = 2 * (cost of 1 football game ticket)
   Solving for the cost of 1 football game ticket, we get:
   Cost of 1 football game ticket = $120 / 2 = $60
4) Now, we can calculate the total amount Chandler will pay:
   Cost of 8 movie tickets = 8 * $30 = $240
   Cost of 5 football game tickets = 5 * $60 = $300
   Total amount Chandler will pay = $240 + $300 = $540

Answer: 540
