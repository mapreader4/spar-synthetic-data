Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Phantom's mom gave him $50 to buy printer inks
* He bought:
    - 2 black printer inks at $11 each, so 2 x $11 = $22
    - 3 red printer inks at $15 each, so 3 x $15 = $45
    - 2 yellow printer inks at $13 each, so 2 x $13 = $26
* The total cost of all the printer inks is:
    - $22 + $45 + $26 = $93
* Phantom's mom gave him $50, but the total cost is $93
* To find how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has ($50) from the total cost ($93):
    - $93 - $50 = $43

Answer: $43
