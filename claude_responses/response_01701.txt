Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sandra has a box of apples that weighs 120 pounds.
2) She's going to use half the weight in apples to make applesauce, which means the other half will be used to make apple pies.
3) The weight of the apples used for the pies is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.
4) She needs 4 pounds of apples per pie.
5) To calculate the number of pies she can make, we divide the total weight of the apples for the pies (60 pounds) by the amount of apples needed per pie (4 pounds).
6) 60 pounds / 4 pounds per pie = 15 pies.
