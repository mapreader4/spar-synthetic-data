Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jessy plans to read a 140-page book in one week
* She initially decides to read 3 times daily, 6 pages each time, every day of the week
* To calculate the total number of pages she would read in a week with this plan:
    - 3 times daily x 6 pages per time = 18 pages per day
    - 18 pages per day x 7 days in a week = 126 pages per week
* The book has 140 pages, so she needs to read 140 pages in total
* The difference between the total pages in the book (140) and the total pages she would read in a week with her initial plan (126) is:
    - 140 pages - 126 pages = 14 pages
* Therefore, Jessy should read 14 more pages per day to achieve her goal.

Answer: 14
