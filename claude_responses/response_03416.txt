Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The temperatures for the week were:
   - Sunday: 40 degrees
   - Monday: 50 degrees
   - Tuesday: 65 degrees
   - Wednesday: 36 degrees
   - Thursday: 82 degrees
   - Friday: 72 degrees
   - Saturday: 26 degrees

2. To calculate the average temperature, we need to add up all the temperatures and divide by the number of days (7).

3. Adding up the temperatures:
   40 + 50 + 65 + 36 + 82 + 72 + 26 = 371

4. Dividing by the number of days:
   371 / 7 = 53

Therefore, the average temperature for that week was 53 degrees.

Answer: 53
