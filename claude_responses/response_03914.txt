Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony did a warm-up puzzle that took 10 minutes
* After that, he did 2 puzzles that each took 3 times as long as the warm-up puzzle
* To calculate the time for each of the 2 puzzles:
  - The warm-up puzzle took 10 minutes
  - Each of the 2 puzzles took 3 times as long, so 3 x 10 = 30 minutes per puzzle
* Now we can calculate the total time spent solving puzzles:
  - Warm-up puzzle: 10 minutes
  - 2 puzzles at 30 minutes each: 2 x 30 = 60 minutes
* Total time spent solving puzzles = 10 minutes + 60 minutes = 70 minutes

Answer: 70
