Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Brian has a total of 100 stones in his first collection.
2) The percentage of white stones and black stones in the first collection is the same as the percentage of grey stones and green stones in the second collection.
3) In the second collection, Brian has 40 grey stones and 60 green stones.
4) The total number of stones in the second collection is 40 + 60 = 100.
5) The percentage of grey stones in the second collection is 40/100 = 40%.
6) The percentage of green stones in the second collection is 60/100 = 60%.
7) Therefore, the percentage of white stones and black stones in the first collection must also be 40% and 60% respectively.
8) Since Brian has 100 stones in the first collection, and the percentage of white stones is 40%, the number of white stones must be 40% of 100, which is 40.
9) Since Brian has more white stones than black stones, the number of black stones must be less than 40.

Answer: 40
