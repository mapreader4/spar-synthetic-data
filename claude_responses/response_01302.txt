Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kevin has 40 counters
* Reina has three times the number of counters as Kevin
* So, Reina has 3 x 40 = 120 counters
* Kevin has 50 marbles
* Reina has four times the number of marbles as Kevin
* So, Reina has 4 x 50 = 200 marbles

Answer: Reina has 120 counters and 200 marbles.
