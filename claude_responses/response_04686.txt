Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Darcy washes and dries 20 shirts and 8 pairs of shorts.
2) He folds 12 of the shirts and 5 of the shorts.
3) To find the number of remaining pieces of clothing he has to fold, we need to subtract the number of items he has already folded from the total number of items.
4) Total number of items: 20 shirts + 8 pairs of shorts = 20 + 16 = 36 items
5) Number of items already folded: 12 shirts + 5 pairs of shorts = 12 + 10 = 22 items
6) Number of remaining items to fold: 36 - 22 = 14 items

Answer: 14
