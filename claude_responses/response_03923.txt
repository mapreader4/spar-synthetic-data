Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Reginald sells each apple for $1.25.
2) His bike cost $80 and the repairs cost 25% of what his bike cost.
   * Repairs cost = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
   * Total cost of bike and repairs = $80 + $20 = $100
3) After the repairs are paid for, 1/5 of the money he'd earned remains.
   * Let's call the total amount of money he earned "x".
   * After repairs are paid for, 4/5 of x remains.
   * 4/5 of x = $100
   * x = $100 / (4/5) = $125
4) Now we can calculate how many apples he sold:
   * Each apple sells for $1.25
   * Total earnings = $125
   * Number of apples sold = $125 / $1.25 = 100 apples

Answer: 100 apples
