Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Tamtam collected a total of 65 shells.
2) She got 13 purple shells, 8 pink shells, 18 yellow shells, and 12 blue shells.
3) To find the number of orange shells, we need to subtract the number of colored shells from the total number of shells.
4) The total number of colored shells is 13 + 8 + 18 + 12 = 51.
5) The number of orange shells is the total number of shells (65) minus the number of colored shells (51).
6) 65 - 51 = 14.

Answer: 14
