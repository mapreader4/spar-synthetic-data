Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Betsy won 5 games of Monopoly
* Helen won twice as many games as Betsy
* So, Helen won 2 x 5 = 10 games
* Susan won three times as many games as Betsy
* So, Susan won 3 x 5 = 15 games
* To find the total number of games won between them, we add up the games won by each person:
* Betsy won 5 games
* Helen won 10 games
* Susan won 15 games
* 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 games

Answer: 30
