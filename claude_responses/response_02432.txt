Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Annie brought 20 brownies to school
* She gave half of them to the school administrator, which is 20 / 2 = 10 brownies
* So, she had 20 - 10 = 10 brownies remaining
* Of the remaining 10 brownies, she gave half to her best friend Carl, which is 10 / 2 = 5 brownies
* So, she had 10 - 5 = 5 brownies remaining
* She then gave 2 more brownies to her friend Simon
* So, the number of brownies she had left is 5 - 2 = 3 brownies
