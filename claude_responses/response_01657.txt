Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sheila has offered to pay five times Purity's share of the rent
* Rose can only afford thrice what Purity pays
* Rose's share is $1,800

First, let's find Purity's share of the rent:
* Rose's share is $1,800, and Rose can only afford thrice what Purity pays
* So, Purity's share = $1,800 / 3 = $600

Next, let's find Sheila's share of the rent:
* Sheila has offered to pay five times Purity's share
* Purity's share is $600, so Sheila's share = 5 x $600 = $3,000

Now, we can find the total house rent:
* Purity's share is $600
* Sheila's share is $3,000
* Rose's share is $1,800
* Total house rent = $600 + $3,000 + $1,800 = $5,400

Answer: $5,400
