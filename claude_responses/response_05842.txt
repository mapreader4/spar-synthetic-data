Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James had 150 subscribers initially
* Someone gifted 50 additional subscribers
* So the total number of subscribers is 150 + 50 = 200 subscribers
* James gets $9 per subscriber per month
* To calculate his monthly earnings, we multiply the total number of subscribers (200) by the amount per subscriber ($9)
* 200 subscribers x $9 per subscriber = $1,800 per month

Answer: $1,800
