Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Crocker made 11 pieces of fried chicken
* Lyndee ate 1 piece
* Each of Lyndee's friends ate 2 pieces
* We need to find out how many friends Lyndee had over

First, let's calculate how many pieces of chicken were eaten by Lyndee's friends:
* Each friend ate 2 pieces
* So the total number of pieces eaten by Lyndee's friends = 2 x (number of friends)

Now, we know that the total number of pieces made was 11, and Lyndee ate 1 piece. So the remaining pieces were eaten by her friends:
* Remaining pieces = 11 - 1 = 10
* 10 = 2 x (number of friends)
* Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
* Number of friends = 10 / 2 = 5

Therefore, Lyndee had 5 friends over.

Answer: 5
