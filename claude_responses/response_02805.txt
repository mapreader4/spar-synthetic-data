Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Scruffy weighs 12 ounces.
2) Muffy weighs 3 ounces less than Scruffy, so Muffy weighs 12 - 3 = 9 ounces.
3) Puffy weighs 5 ounces more than Muffy, so Puffy weighs 9 + 5 = 14 ounces.
4) If Brittany puts Puffy and Muffy on the scale, the scale would indicate the total weight of the two gerbils.
5) The total weight of Puffy and Muffy is 14 ounces + 9 ounces = 23 ounces.

Answer: 23 ounces
