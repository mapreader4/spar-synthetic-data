Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jade earns $1600 per month
* She spends 75% of her income on living expenses
* 75% of $1600 = 0.75 * $1600 = $1200 on living expenses
* She spends one-fifth of her income on insurance
* One-fifth of $1600 = 0.2 * $1600 = $320 on insurance
* The remaining amount is what she saves
* $1600 - $1200 - $320 = $80 saved per month

Answer: $80
