Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Martha is knitting for 3 grandchildren, who are all the same size
* Each set of clothes consists of:
  - 1 woolen hat
  - 1 scarf
  - 1 sweater
  - 2 mittens
  - 2 wooly socks
* Time required for each item:
  - Hat: 2 hours
  - Scarf: 3 hours
  - Each mitten: 1 hour (so 2 mittens = 2 hours)
  - Each sock: 1.5 hours (so 2 socks = 3 hours)
  - Sweater: 6 hours
* To calculate the total time:
  - 3 hats x 2 hours = 6 hours
  - 3 scarves x 3 hours = 9 hours
  - 3 sweaters x 6 hours = 18 hours
  - 6 mittens x 1 hour = 6 hours
  - 6 socks x 1.5 hours = 9 hours
* Adding all these together:
  - 6 + 9 + 18 + 6 + 9 = 48 hours

Answer: 48 hours
