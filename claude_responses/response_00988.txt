Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The height of the box is 12 inches.
2) The length of the box is 3 times its height, which means the length is 3 x 12 = 36 inches.
3) The width of the box is 1/4 the length, which means the width is 36 / 4 = 9 inches.
4) To calculate the volume of the box, we multiply the length, width, and height:
Volume = Length x Width x Height
Volume = 36 inches x 9 inches x 12 inches
Volume = 3,888 cubic inches

Answer: 3,888
