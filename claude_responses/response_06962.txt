Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Keanu gave his dog 40 fish.
2) He gave his cat half as many fish as he gave to his dog. 
   * So, he gave his cat 40 / 2 = 20 fish.
3) The total number of fish he bought is the sum of the fish given to his dog and his cat.
   * Total fish = 40 + 20 = 60 fish.
4) Each fish cost $4.
5) To calculate the total amount of money spent, we multiply the total number of fish by the cost per fish.
   * Total amount spent = 60 fish * $4 per fish = $240.

Answer: 240
