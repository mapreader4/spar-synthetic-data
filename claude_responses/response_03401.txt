Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jack says he has 13 more notebooks than Gerald.
2) Gerald has 8 notebooks.
3) Therefore, Jack has 8 + 13 = 21 notebooks.
4) Jack gives 5 notebooks to Paula and 6 notebooks to Mike.
5) So, Jack has given away a total of 5 + 6 = 11 notebooks.
6) Therefore, the number of notebooks Jack has left is 21 - 11 = 10.
