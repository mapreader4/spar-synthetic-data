Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each tire repair costs $7
* There is an additional 50 cents for sales tax per tire
* Juan needs all 4 tires repaired

First, let's calculate the cost of repairing one tire:
* Cost of tire repair: $7
* Sales tax: $0.50
* Total cost per tire: $7 + $0.50 = $7.50

Now, to find the total cost for all 4 tires, we multiply the cost per tire by the number of tires:
* Total cost = $7.50 x 4 = $30

Therefore, the final cost for Juan to have all 4 tires repaired is:

Answer: $30
