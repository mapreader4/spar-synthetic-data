Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marco uses 1/5 of an ounce of dry tea leaves per day
* Each box of tea leaves contains 28 ounces
* We need to find out how many days' worth of tea leaves are in a box

First, let's calculate how many days' worth of tea leaves are in a box:
* 28 ounces / (1/5 ounce per day) = 28 * 5 = 140 days' worth of tea leaves

Now, to find out how many weeks of daily tea Marco gets from a box, we divide the number of days by 7 days per week:
* 140 days / 7 days per week = 20 weeks

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 20
