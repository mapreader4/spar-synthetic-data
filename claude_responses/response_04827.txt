Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 360 balls in the ball pit.
2) A quarter of the balls are red. To find the number of red balls, we take 1/4 of 360, which is 90 red balls.
3) The remaining balls are non-red. We can find the number of non-red balls by subtracting the red balls from the total: 360 - 90 = 270 non-red balls.
4) A fifth of the non-red balls are blue. To find the number of blue balls, we take 1/5 of 270, which is 54 blue balls.
5) The remaining balls are neither red nor blue. To find the number of balls that are neither red nor blue, we subtract the red and blue balls from the total: 360 - 90 - 54 = 216 balls that are neither red nor blue.

Answer: 216
