Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

In the first week:
* They normally pack 40 apples in a box
* They produce 50 full boxes per day
* So in one day, they pack 40 * 50 = 2,000 apples
* In one week (7 days), they pack 2,000 * 7 = 14,000 apples

In the second week:
* They packed 500 fewer apples per day
* So they packed 2,000 - 500 = 1,500 apples per day
* In one week (7 days), they packed 1,500 * 7 = 10,500 apples

Now, to find the total number of apples packed in the two weeks:
* Total apples packed = apples packed in first week + apples packed in second week
* Total apples packed = 14,000 + 10,500 = 24,500 apples

Answer: 24,500
