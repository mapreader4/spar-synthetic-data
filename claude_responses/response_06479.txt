Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cheyenne made 80 clay pots in a particular week.
2) 2/5 of the 80 pots cracked and could not be sold.
3) To find the number of pots that cracked, we multiply 80 by 2/5:
   80 * 2/5 = 160/5 = 32 pots cracked
4) To find the number of pots that were not cracked and could be sold, we subtract the number of cracked pots from the total number of pots:
   80 - 32 = 48 pots
5) Cheyenne sold each pot for $40.
6) To find the total amount of money Cheyenne made, we multiply the number of pots sold (48) by the price per pot ($40):
   48 * $40 = $1,920

Answer: $1,920
