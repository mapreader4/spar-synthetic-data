Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Amber has $7 to spend.
2) The candy costs $1 per bag and contains 12 ounces per bag.
3) The chips cost $1.40 per bag and contain 17 ounces per bag.
4) To find the most ounces, we need to calculate how many bags of each item she can buy with $7.
5) For the candy, she can buy 7 bags ($7 / $1 per bag = 7 bags).
6) For the chips, she can buy 5 bags ($7 / $1.40 per bag = 5 bags).
7) 7 bags of candy at 12 ounces per bag is 84 ounces.
8) 5 bags of chips at 17 ounces per bag is 85 ounces.
9) Since 85 ounces is greater than 84 ounces, the item that gives her the most ounces is the chips.

Answer: 85
