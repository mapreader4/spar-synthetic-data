Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of a slice of cake is three-fourths of the cost of a cup of milk tea.
2) The cost of a cup of milk tea is $2.40.
3) To find the cost of a slice of cake, we take three-fourths of $2.40:
   * 3/4 * $2.40 = $1.80
4) Now, we need to find the total cost of 2 slices of cake and 1 cup of milk tea.
   * 2 slices of cake at $1.80 each = $3.60
   * 1 cup of milk tea at $2.40 = $2.40
   * Total cost = $3.60 + $2.40 = $6.00

Answer: $6
