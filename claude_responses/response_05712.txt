Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The airline company owns 5 airplanes.
2) Each airplane has 20 rows with 7 seats in each row.
3) To calculate the total number of seats per airplane, we multiply the number of rows (20) by the number of seats per row (7):
20 rows x 7 seats per row = 140 seats per airplane
4) Since the airline company owns 5 airplanes, the total number of seats across all airplanes is:
5 airplanes x 140 seats per airplane = 700 seats
5) Each airplane makes 2 flights per day.
6) Therefore, the total number of passengers the airline company can accommodate each day is:
700 seats x 2 flights per day = 1,400 passengers

Answer: 1,400
