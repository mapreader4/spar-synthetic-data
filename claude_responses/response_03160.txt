Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James had two browsers on his computer
* In each browser, he opened three windows
* Each window had ten tabs
* So, for each browser:
  - 3 windows
  - 10 tabs per window
  - 3 windows x 10 tabs per window = 30 tabs per browser
* Since James had two browsers, the total number of tabs is:
  - 2 browsers x 30 tabs per browser = 60 tabs

Answer: 60
