Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pet store can buy a goldfish for $0.25 and sell it for $0.75
* The owner plans to use the profits from goldfish sales to buy a new tank, which costs $100
* After one week, he is 45% short of the price

To find the number of goldfish he sold, we need to:
1. Calculate the profit per goldfish
2. Calculate the total profit needed to buy the $100 tank
3. Calculate the amount of profit he has after one week
4. Calculate the number of goldfish he sold to get that amount of profit

1. Profit per goldfish = $0.75 - $0.25 = $0.50

2. Total profit needed to buy the $100 tank = $100

3. After one week, he is 45% short of the price, so he has 55% of the $100 tank price, which is $55

4. To find the number of goldfish sold, we divide the amount of profit he has ($55) by the profit per goldfish ($0.50):
   $55 / $0.50 = 110 goldfish

Answer: 110
