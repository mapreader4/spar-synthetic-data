Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 6 white daisies.
2) There are nine times as many pink daisies as white daisies. So, the number of pink daisies is 9 x 6 = 54.
3) There are three less than four times as many red daisies as pink daisies. So, the number of red daisies is (4 x 54) - 3 = 213.
4) To find the total number of daisies, we add the number of white, pink, and red daisies:
6 + 54 + 213 = 273

Answer: 273
