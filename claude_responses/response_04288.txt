Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wilson buys 2 hamburgers at $5 each, so the total cost of the hamburgers is 2 x $5 = $10.
2) Wilson buys 3 bottles of cola at $2 each, so the total cost of the cola is 3 x $2 = $6.
3) The total cost of the items before the discount is $10 + $6 = $16.
4) Wilson has a $4 discount coupon, so the final amount he pays is $16 - $4 = $12.
