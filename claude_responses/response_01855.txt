Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 60% of the citizens own a pet
* Half of the pet owners own a dog
* 30 citizens own a cat

First, let's find the number of citizens who own a dog:
* If half of the pet owners own a dog, and 60% of the citizens own a pet, then the number of dog owners is 60% / 2 = 30% of the total citizens.

Now, let's find the total number of citizens in the town:
* We know that 30 citizens own a cat, and this represents 30% of the total citizens (since 30% of citizens own a pet, and half of those own a cat).
* Therefore, the total number of citizens is 30 / 0.3 = 100.

Answer: 100
