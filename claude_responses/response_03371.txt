Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* The book has 5 chapters
* The total number of pages in the book is 95
* Each chapter has 3 more pages than the previous one

Let's represent the number of pages in the first chapter as x.
Then, the number of pages in the second chapter is x + 3, the third chapter is x + 6, the fourth chapter is x + 9, and the fifth chapter is x + 12.

The total number of pages in the book is the sum of the pages in each chapter:
x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 95

Simplifying this equation:
5x + 30 = 95
5x = 65
x = 13

Therefore, the first chapter has 13 pages.

Answer: 13
