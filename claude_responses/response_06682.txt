Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beth originally had 125 gold coins.
2) Carl gave Beth an additional 35 gold coins.
3) So, the total number of coins Beth had after receiving the gift from Carl is 125 + 35 = 160 coins.
4) Beth decided to sell half of her coins.
5) Half of 160 coins is 160 / 2 = 80 coins.

Answer: 80
