Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michelle originally made 20 sandwiches
* She gave 4 sandwiches to one of her co-workers
* She kept twice the amount she gave to her co-worker for herself
* To find the amount she kept for herself, we multiply the 4 sandwiches she gave to her co-worker by 2, which is 8 sandwiches

Now, to find the number of sandwiches she has left to give to her other co-workers, we need to subtract the number of sandwiches she gave to her co-worker and the number of sandwiches she kept for herself from the original 20 sandwiches.

* 20 sandwiches - 4 sandwiches (given to co-worker) - 8 sandwiches (kept for herself) = 8 sandwiches

Answer: 8
