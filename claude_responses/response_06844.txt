Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Julia's internet speed is 20 MBps (megabytes per second)
* The size per song is 5MB (megabytes)
* We want to know how many songs she can download in half an hour

First, let's calculate how many megabytes she can download in half an hour:
* 20 MBps x 1800 seconds (half an hour) = 36,000 MB

Now, we can calculate how many songs she can download in half an hour:
* 36,000 MB / 5 MB per song = 7,200 songs

Answer: 7,200
