Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Charlie owns:
* 1 flute
* 2 horns
* 1 harp

Carli owns:
* Twice as many flutes as Charlie, which is 2 flutes
* Half as many horns as Charlie, which is 1 horn
* No harps

Now, we can add up the total number of instruments owned by Charlie and Carli:

Charlie's instruments:
* 1 flute
* 2 horns
* 1 harp
* Total: 4 instruments

Carli's instruments:
* 2 flutes
* 1 horn
* 0 harps
* Total: 3 instruments

The combined total number of instruments owned by Charlie and Carli is:
4 + 3 = 7 instruments
