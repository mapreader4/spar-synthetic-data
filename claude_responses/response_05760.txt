Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The original price of the tub of ice cream is $12.
2. During the anniversary sale, the tub of ice cream costs $2 less than the original price, which means the sale price is $12 - $2 = $10.
3. The juice is sold at $2 for 5 cans, which means the price per can is $2 / 5 = $0.40.
4. If you buy 10 cans of juice, the total cost of the juice will be 10 cans x $0.40 per can = $4.
5. If you buy two tubs of ice cream, the total cost of the ice cream will be 2 tubs x $10 per tub = $20.
6. The total cost of the purchase will be the cost of the ice cream plus the cost of the juice:
   $20 (ice cream) + $4 (juice) = $24.
