Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Omar takes 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet
* This means Omar's rate of raising the kite is 240 feet / 12 minutes = 20 feet per minute
* Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar
* Jasper's rate of raising the kite is 3 x 20 feet per minute = 60 feet per minute
* Jasper needs to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet
* To calculate the time it takes Jasper to raise his kite 600 feet, we divide the height by the rate:
* 600 feet / 60 feet per minute = 10 minutes

Answer: 10 minutes
