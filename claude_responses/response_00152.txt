Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The normal cost of the subscription is $80.
2) The subscription is offered with a 45% discount.
3) To calculate the discounted price, we need to find 45% of $80.
4) 45% of $80 is 0.45 * $80 = $36.
5) The discounted price is the normal price ($80) minus the discount ($36).
6) $80 - $36 = $44.
Answer: $44.
