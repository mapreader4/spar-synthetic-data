Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jack and Rose made 1,236 flyers to hand out around their neighborhood.
2) Jack handed out 120 flyers.
3) Rose handed out 320 flyers.
4) To find the number of flyers left to be handed out, we need to subtract the number of flyers handed out from the total number of flyers made.
5) The total number of flyers handed out is 120 (by Jack) + 320 (by Rose) = 440.
6) The total number of flyers made was 1,236.
7) So the number of flyers left to be handed out is 1,236 - 440 = 796.

Answer: 796
