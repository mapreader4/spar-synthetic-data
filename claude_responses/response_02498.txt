Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark ordered 100 chicken nuggets
* A box of 20 chicken nuggets costs $4
* To calculate the total cost, we need to find how many boxes of 20 chicken nuggets Mark needs to buy to get 100 chicken nuggets
* 100 chicken nuggets / 20 chicken nuggets per box = 5 boxes
* 5 boxes x $4 per box = $20

Answer: $20
