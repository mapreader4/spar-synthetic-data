Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Grace's tower is 8 times the size of Clyde's tower.
2) Grace's tower is 40 inches tall.
3) To find Clyde's tower height, we divide Grace's tower height by 8:
   * Clyde's tower height = 40 inches / 8 = 5 inches
4) To find the difference in height between Grace's and Clyde's towers, we subtract Clyde's height from Grace's height:
   * Difference in height = 40 inches - 5 inches = 35 inches

Answer: 35 inches
