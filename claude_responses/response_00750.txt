Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jamal bought 4 half dozen colored crayons.
2) A half dozen is 6 crayons.
3) So, Jamal bought 4 x 6 = 24 crayons.
4) Each crayon costs $2.
5) To find the total cost, we multiply the number of crayons (24) by the cost per crayon ($2):
24 crayons x $2 per crayon = $48.

Answer: 48
