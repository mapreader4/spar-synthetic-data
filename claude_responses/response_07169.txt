Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Annie picked 8 pints of blueberries
* Kathryn picked 2 pints more than Annie
* To find how many pints Kathryn picked, we add 2 to the number of pints Annie picked:
    * Kathryn picked 8 + 2 = 10 pints
* Ben picked 3 pints fewer than Kathryn
* To find how many pints Ben picked, we subtract 3 from the number of pints Kathryn picked:
    * Ben picked 10 - 3 = 7 pints
* To find the total number of pints picked by the three, we add up the individual amounts:
    * Total pints picked = Annie's 8 + Kathryn's 10 + Ben's 7
    * Total pints picked = 8 + 10 + 7 = 25 pints

Answer: 25
