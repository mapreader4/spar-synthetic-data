Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom gets 10 points for killing each enemy
* He killed 150 enemies
* So his base score is:
    - 150 enemies x 10 points per enemy = 1,500 points
* If he kills at least 100 enemies, he gets a 50% bonus to his score
* Since he killed 150 enemies, which is more than 100, he gets the 50% bonus
* The bonus is 50% of his base score of 1,500 points
    - 50% of 1,500 = 0.5 x 1,500 = 750 points
* His total score is his base score plus the bonus:
    - 1,500 points + 750 points = 2,250 points

Answer: 2,250
