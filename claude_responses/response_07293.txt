Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brenda needs to spay some cats and twice as many dogs
* The total number of animals she needs to spay is 21
* Let's represent the number of cats as x
* Since Brenda needs to spay twice as many dogs as cats, the number of dogs would be 2x
* The total number of animals is the sum of the cats and dogs, which is x + 2x = 3x
* We know the total number of animals is 21, so we can set up the equation:
3x = 21
* Solving for x, we get:
x = 21 / 3
x = 7

Answer: 7
