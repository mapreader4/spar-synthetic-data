Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pie shop charges $3 per slice of custard pie
* Each whole pie is cut into 10 slices
* The pie shop makes 6 whole custard pies

To calculate the total money the pie shop will earn, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of slices made from the 6 whole pies:
   * 6 pies x 10 slices per pie = 60 slices
2. Multiply the number of slices by the price per slice to get the total earnings:
   * 60 slices x $3 per slice = $180

Answer: $180
