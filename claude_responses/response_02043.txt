Okay, let's break this down step by step:

Last month:
- William read 6 books
- Brad read thrice as many books as William, which is 3 x 6 = 18 books

This month:
- William read twice as many books as Brad, who read 8 books
- So, William read 2 x 8 = 16 books this month

Total books read across the two months:
- William: 6 + 16 = 22 books
- Brad: 18 + 8 = 26 books

Therefore, Brad has read more books across the two months than William by:
26 - 22 = 4 books

Answer: 4
