Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Grady has 20 red numbered cubes and 15 blue numbered cubes.
2) Grady gives Gage 2/5 of his red numbered cubes and 1/3 of his blue numbered cubes.
3) To find the number of red numbered cubes Gage received, we take 2/5 of 20, which is 8 red numbered cubes.
4) To find the number of blue numbered cubes Gage received, we take 1/3 of 15, which is 5 blue numbered cubes.
5) Gage already had 10 red numbered cubes and 12 blue numbered cubes.
6) So the total number of cubes Gage has is:
   - Red numbered cubes: 10 + 8 = 18
   - Blue numbered cubes: 12 + 5 = 17
7) The total number of cubes Gage has is 18 + 17 = 35.

Answer: 35
