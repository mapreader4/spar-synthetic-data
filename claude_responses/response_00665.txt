Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill picked 50 apples from the orchard with his wife and two children
* He sends each of his two kids to school with 3 apples for their two favorite teachers
* So, he sends 2 kids x 3 apples x 2 teachers = 12 apples to school
* His wife Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie
* So, she uses 2 pies x 10 apples per pie = 20 apples for the pies

Now, we can calculate the number of apples Bill has left:
* Total apples picked: 50
* Apples sent to school: 12
* Apples used for pies: 20
* Apples left: 50 - 12 - 20 = 18

Answer: 18
