Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elizabeth has $20 to spend
* Each pencil costs $1.60
* Each pen costs $2
* Elizabeth wants to buy 6 pens

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 6 pens:
* 6 pens x $2 per pen = $12

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pens from the total amount of money Elizabeth has:
* $20 - $12 = $8 remaining

Now, we can calculate how many pencils Elizabeth can buy with the remaining $8:
* $8 / $1.60 per pencil = 5 pencils

Therefore, Elizabeth can buy 5 pencils with her remaining $8 after buying 6 pens.
