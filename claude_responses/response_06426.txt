Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The blind cave scorpion needs to eat a total of 800 body segments every day
* It has already eaten:
  - 1 millipede with 60 segments
  - 2 millipedes that are twice as long, so each has 2 * 60 = 120 segments
* So the total segments it has already eaten is:
  - 60 + (2 * 120) = 300 segments
* Now we need to calculate how many 50-segment millipedes it needs to eat to reach its daily total of 800 segments
* To do this, we take the total segments needed (800) and subtract the segments already eaten (300)
* 800 - 300 = 500 segments still needed
* Since each 50-segment millipede provides 50 segments, we divide the remaining 500 segments by 50 to get the number of 50-segment millipedes needed
* 500 / 50 = 10 millipedes
