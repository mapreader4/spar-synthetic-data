Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The traveler drank 32 ounces of water.
2) The camel drank seven times as much as the traveler, which means the camel drank 32 x 7 = 224 ounces of water.
3) The total amount of water they drank is the sum of the traveler's and the camel's water consumption, which is 32 + 224 = 256 ounces.
4) There are 128 ounces in a gallon, so to find the number of gallons, we divide the total ounces by 128.
5) 256 ounces / 128 ounces per gallon = 2 gallons.
