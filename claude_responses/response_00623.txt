Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recipe for one drink uses 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade.
* So the total amount of liquid in one drink is 1/4 + 1 and 1/4 = 1 and 1/2 cups.
* The pitcher is filled with 18 total cups of this drink.
* To find the total amount of lemonade in the pitcher, we need to multiply the amount of lemonade per drink (1 and 1/4 cups) by the total number of drinks in the pitcher (18).
* 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade per drink x 18 drinks = 22 and 1/2 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.

Answer: 22
