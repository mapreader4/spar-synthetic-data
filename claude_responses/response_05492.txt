Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 2 dozen cookies
* 1 dozen = 12 cookies
* So, 2 dozen = 2 x 12 = 24 cookies
* John eats 3 cookies
* To find the number of cookies he has left, we take the total number of cookies (24) and subtract the number he ate (3)
* 24 - 3 = 21

Answer: 21
