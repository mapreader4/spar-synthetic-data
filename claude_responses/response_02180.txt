Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cost of the car is $1700
* 6 friends originally planned to split the cost equally
* They earned $500 from the car wash, which would be taken out of the total cost
* So the remaining cost to be split between the 6 friends would be $1700 - $500 = $1200
* If the $1200 was split equally between 6 friends, each friend would have to pay $1200 / 6 = $200
* However, Brad decided not to participate, so now the $1200 needs to be split between the remaining 5 friends
* The new amount each friend has to pay is $1200 / 5 = $240
* The difference between the original $200 and the new $240 is $240 - $200 = $40
* Therefore, each friend now has to pay $40 more than originally planned.

Answer: $40
