Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Megan works 8 hours per day
* Megan earns $7.50 per hour
* Megan works 20 days per month

To calculate her earnings for one month, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she works per day, and then multiply that by the number of days she works per month:
* 8 hours per day x $7.50 per hour = $60 per day
* $60 per day x 20 days per month = $1,200 per month

Now, to calculate her total earnings for two months, we simply multiply her monthly earnings by 2:
* $1,200 per month x 2 months = $2,400

Answer: $2,400
