Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peter has 10 candles on his cake
* Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter
* To find the number of candles on Rupert's cake, we need to first find Rupert's age relative to Peter's age
* Since Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter, we can multiply Peter's age by 3.5 to get Rupert's age
* Peter's age is represented by the 10 candles on his cake
* So Rupert's age is 10 x 3.5 = 35
* Since the number of candles on a birthday cake represents the person's age, Rupert's cake will have 35 candles.

Answer: 35
