Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys a heating pad for $30.
2) He uses the heating pad 3 times a week.
3) He uses the heating pad for 2 weeks.
4) To calculate the total number of times he uses the heating pad, we multiply the number of times per week (3) by the number of weeks (2): 3 x 2 = 6 times.
5) To calculate the cost per use, we divide the total cost of the heating pad ($30) by the number of times he uses it (6 times): $30 / 6 = $5 per use.

Answer: $5
