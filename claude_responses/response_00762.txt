Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lenny bought 20 boxes of pens, and each box contained 5 pens.
2) So the total number of pens Lenny bought is 20 boxes x 5 pens per box = 100 pens.
3) Lenny gave 40% of the pens to her close friends. 40% of 100 pens is 0.4 x 100 = 40 pens.
4) That leaves 100 - 40 = 60 pens remaining.
5) Lenny then gave one-fourth of the remaining 60 pens to her classmates. One-fourth of 60 is 60 / 4 = 15 pens.
6) The number of pens left for Lenny is the original 100 pens, minus the 40 pens given to her close friends, minus the 15 pens given to her classmates.
7) 100 - 40 - 15 = 45 pens.

Answer: 45
