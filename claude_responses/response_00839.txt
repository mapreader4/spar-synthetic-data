Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Small children tickets sold: 53
* Small children eat 1/2 omelet each
* So for the small children, they need 53 * 1/2 = 26.5 omelets
* Older children tickets sold: 35
* Older children eat 1 omelet each
* So for the older children, they need 35 omelets
* Adult tickets sold: 75
* Adults eat 2 omelets each
* So for the adults, they need 75 * 2 = 150 omelets
* Senior tickets sold: 37
* Seniors eat 1.5 omelets each
* So for the seniors, they need 37 * 1.5 = 55.5 omelets
* Total omelets needed = 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 = 267 omelets
* Plus 25 extra omelets = 292 omelets
* Each omelet requires 2 eggs
* Therefore, the total number of eggs needed is 292 * 2 = 584 eggs

Answer: 584
