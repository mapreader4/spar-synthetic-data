Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alec's class has 60 students
* Half of the class (30 students) have already said they will vote for Alec
* Out of the remaining 30 students, 5 have said they are thinking about voting for Alec
* After Alec changes his flyers, a fifth of the remaining 25 students (who were thinking about voting for someone else) say they will vote for Alec
* That means 5 + (1/5 * 25) = 10 additional students will vote for Alec
* So the total number of votes Alec has is 30 + 10 = 40 votes
* Alec's goal is to get three-quarters of the class (45 votes) to vote for him
* So Alec needs 45 - 40 = 5 more votes to reach his goal
