Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 3 birds, each with 2 legs
* There were 5 dogs, each with 4 legs
* There were 4 snakes, each with 0 legs (snakes do not have legs)
* There was 1 spider, with 8 legs

To calculate the total number of legs:
* 3 birds x 2 legs = 6 legs
* 5 dogs x 4 legs = 20 legs
* 4 snakes x 0 legs = 0 legs
* 1 spider x 8 legs = 8 legs

Adding these up:
6 + 20 + 0 + 8 = 34 legs

Answer: 34
