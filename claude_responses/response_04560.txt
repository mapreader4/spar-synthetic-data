Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James writes a comic every other day
* There are 365 days in a year (assuming no leap year)
* In 4 years, there are 4 * 365 = 1,460 days
* Since James writes a comic every other day, he will write a comic on half of the days
* 1,460 days / 2 = 730 comics

Answer: 730
