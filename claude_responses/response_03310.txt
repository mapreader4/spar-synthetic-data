Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aubriella is pouring water into a 50-gallon fish tank
* She is pouring at the rate of 1 gallon every 20 seconds
* She has been pouring for 6 minutes

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to seconds:
* 6 minutes = 6 x 60 = 360 seconds

Now, we can calculate how many gallons she has poured in 360 seconds:
* 360 seconds / 20 seconds per gallon = 18 gallons

So, Aubriella has poured 18 gallons of water into the 50-gallon fish tank.

To calculate how many more gallons she needs to pour to fill the tank, we take the total capacity (50 gallons) and subtract the amount she has already poured (18 gallons):
* 50 gallons - 18 gallons = 32 gallons

Answer: 32 gallons
