Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James turned 23 at the same time John turned 35.
2) Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age.
3) Tim is 79 years old.

To find Tim's age in relation to John's age:
* Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age
* So, 2 * John's age - 5 = Tim's age
* Since Tim is 79, we can solve for John's age:
* 2 * John's age - 5 = 79
* 2 * John's age = 84
* John's age = 42

Now that we know John's age is 42, we can find James' age:
* James turned 23 at the same time John turned 35
* So, James is 23 years old.

Answer: 23
