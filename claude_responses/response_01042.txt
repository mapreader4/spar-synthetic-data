Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kim's dad buys her 2 candy bars per week
* Kim eats 1 candy bar every 4 weeks, saving the rest
* We want to know how many candy bars Kim has saved after 16 weeks

First, let's calculate how many candy bars Kim's dad bought for her in 16 weeks:
* 2 candy bars per week x 16 weeks = 32 candy bars

Now, let's calculate how many candy bars Kim ate in 16 weeks:
* 1 candy bar every 4 weeks, so in 16 weeks she ate 4 candy bars

Finally, to find how many candy bars Kim has saved, we take the total number of candy bars bought and subtract the number she ate:
* 32 candy bars - 4 candy bars = 28 candy bars

Answer: 28
