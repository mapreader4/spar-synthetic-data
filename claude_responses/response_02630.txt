Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carter has a 14-hour road trip
* He wants to stop every 2 hours to stretch his legs
* He also wants to make 2 additional stops for food
* He also wants to make 3 additional stops for gas
* Each pit stop takes 20 minutes

First, let's calculate the number of stops for stretching his legs:
* 14 hours / 2 hours per stop = 7 stops

Next, let's add the additional stops for food and gas:
* 7 stops (for stretching) + 2 stops (for food) + 3 stops (for gas) = 12 total stops

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on the pit stops:
* 12 stops x 20 minutes per stop = 240 minutes
* 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Finally, we add the time spent on pit stops to the original 14-hour road trip:
* 14 hours + 4 hours = 18 hours

Answer: 18 hours
