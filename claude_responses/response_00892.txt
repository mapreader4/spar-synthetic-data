Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The auto shop has a part that costs $80 each
* Clark buys 7 of these parts
* Without any discount, the total cost would be:
    - 7 parts x $80 per part = $560
* However, Clark only had to pay $439
* To find the discount, we need to subtract the amount Clark paid ($439) from the original total cost without the discount ($560)
* $560 - $439 = $121
* Therefore, the discount amount is $121.

Answer: 121
