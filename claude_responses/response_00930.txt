Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 2 men and 3 women
* Each man bought 30 apples
* Each woman bought 20 more apples than each man
* So, each woman bought 30 + 20 = 50 apples

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples bought:
* 2 men x 30 apples each = 60 apples
* 3 women x 50 apples each = 150 apples
* Total apples bought = 60 + 150 = 210 apples

Answer: 210
