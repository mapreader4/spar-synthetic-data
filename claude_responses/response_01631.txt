Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John is currently 10 years old
* His sister is twice his age, so she is currently 20 years old
* We want to know how old his sister will be when John is 50 years old

To find this, we need to calculate how much time has passed between John being 10 years old and him being 50 years old.
* 50 years old - 10 years old = 40 years

Since his sister is currently 20 years old, and 40 years have passed, we can add 40 years to her current age to find her age when John is 50.
* 20 years old + 40 years = 60 years old

Answer: 60
