Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary Anne drinks 1/5 of a bottle of sparkling water every night at dinner
* Each bottle costs $2.00
* We need to find out how much she spends on sparkling water every year

First, let's calculate how many bottles she drinks in a year:
* There are 365 days in a year
* She drinks 1/5 of a bottle every night
* So, in a year, she drinks 365 * 1/5 = 73 bottles

Now, let's calculate the cost of those 73 bottles:
* Each bottle costs $2.00
* So, the total cost is 73 * $2.00 = $146

Therefore, the amount Mary Anne spends on sparkling water every year is:
Answer: $146
