To calculate Berry's average temperature for the week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up all the temperatures for the week:
   99.1 + 98.2 + 98.7 + 99.3 + 99.8 + 99.0 + 98.9 = 693.0

2. Count the number of days in the week:
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. Divide the total temperature by the number of days to get the average:
   693.0 รท 7 = 99.0

Therefore, Berry's average temperature for the week is 99.0 degrees.

Answer: 99
