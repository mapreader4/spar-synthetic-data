Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We have three different 6th grade classes that are combining for a square dancing unit.
2) The teachers would like each male student to partner with a female student for the unit.
3) The first class has 17 males and 13 females.
4) The second class has 14 males and 18 females.
5) The third class has 15 males and 17 females.
6) When the classes are combined, we need to find the total number of males and females.
7) The total number of males is 17 + 14 + 15 = 46.
8) The total number of females is 13 + 18 + 17 = 48.
9) Since we want each male student to partner with a female student, the number of students unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender is the difference between the number of males and females.
10) The difference between the number of males and females is 48 - 46 = 2.
