Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Building A has 4 floors
* Building B has 9 more floors than Building A
* So, Building B has 4 + 9 = 13 floors
* Building C has six less than five times as many floors as Building B
* Five times as many floors as Building B is 5 * 13 = 65
* Building C has six less than 65, which is 65 - 6 = 59 floors

Answer: 59
