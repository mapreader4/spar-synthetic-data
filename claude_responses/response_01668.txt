Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The average weight of a rock is 1.5 pounds.
2) The rock collector pays $4 for every pound of rocks.
3) Jim made $60 off the sale.
4) To find the total weight of the rocks, we can divide the total amount Jim made ($60) by the price per pound ($4):
   Total weight of rocks = $60 / $4 per pound = 15 pounds
5) Now, to find the number of rocks, we can divide the total weight of rocks (15 pounds) by the average weight of a rock (1.5 pounds):
   Number of rocks = 15 pounds / 1.5 pounds per rock = 10 rocks

Answer: 10 rocks
