Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maria's monthly salary is $2000.
2) 20% of her salary goes to paying tax. 20% of $2000 is $400, so the tax deduction is $400.
3) 5% of her salary goes to insurance. 5% of $2000 is $100, so the insurance deduction is $100.
4) After the tax and insurance deductions, Maria has $2000 - $400 - $100 = $1500 left.
5) A quarter (25%) of the $1500 is spent on utility bills. 25% of $1500 is $375, so the utility bill payment is $375.
6) Finally, the amount of money Maria has after the deductions and utility bills payment is $1500 - $375 = $1125.

Answer: 1125
