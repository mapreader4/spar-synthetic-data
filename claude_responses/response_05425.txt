Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The population of Johnstown is 80 people
* Every single person drives by themselves to work
* Each car on the road pollutes 10 pounds of carbon per year
* A single bus pollutes 100 pounds of carbon per year
* A bus can hold 40 people
* The town decides to start running a bus
* 25% of the people who used to drive now take the bus

First, let's calculate the total carbon emissions before the bus was introduced:
* 80 people driving by themselves
* Each car pollutes 10 pounds of carbon per year
* Total carbon emissions = 80 * 10 = 800 pounds of carbon per year

Now, let's calculate the carbon emissions after 25% of the people start taking the bus:
* 25% of 80 people = 0.25 * 80 = 20 people take the bus
* 1 bus pollutes 100 pounds of carbon per year
* Remaining 60 people still drive by themselves
* Total carbon emissions = (60 * 10) + 100 = 700 pounds of carbon per year

To calculate the reduction in carbon emissions:
* Carbon emissions before bus = 800 pounds per year
* Carbon emissions after bus = 700 pounds per year
* Reduction in carbon emissions = 800 - 700 = 100 pounds per year

Answer: 100 pounds
