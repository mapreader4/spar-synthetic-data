Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A pencil costs $0.5 each
* The office needs 2 dozen pencils, which is 24 pencils
* So the cost of the pencils is 24 * $0.5 = $12
* A folder costs $0.9 each
* The office needs 20 folders
* So the cost of the folders is 20 * $0.9 = $18
* To find the total cost, we add the cost of the pencils and the cost of the folders:
* $12 + $18 = $30

Answer: 30
