Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tobias sold 2 red tractors and 3 green tractors this week
* He gets paid 10% of the sales price for each red tractor he sells
* He gets paid 20% of the sales price for each green tractor he sells
* The price of a single red tractor is $20,000
* Tobias's total salary this week was $7,000

To find the full price of a single green tractor, we can use the following information:
* Tobias's total salary this week was $7,000
* He gets paid 10% of the sales price for each red tractor he sells
* He gets paid 20% of the sales price for each green tractor he sells

First, let's calculate how much Tobias earned from selling the red tractors:
* 2 red tractors sold
* Each red tractor costs $20,000
* Tobias gets 10% of the sales price for each red tractor
* So, Tobias earned 2 * $20,000 * 0.10 = $4,000 from the red tractors

Now, let's calculate how much Tobias earned from selling the green tractors:
* 3 green tractors sold
* Tobias gets 20% of the sales price for each green tractor
* We don't know the full price of a single green tractor yet, so let's call it x
* So, Tobias earned 3 * x * 0.20 = $3,000 from the green tractors

We know that Tobias's total salary this week was $7,000, so:
* $4,000 (from red tractors) + $3,000 (from green tractors) = $7,000
* Solving for x, we get: 3x * 0.20 = $3,000
* x = $50,000

Answer: $50,000
