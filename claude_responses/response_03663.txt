Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beth has $35 less than $105, which means she currently has $70.
2) Jan has $10 less than Beth, which means he currently has $60.
3) To find the total amount of money Beth and Jan have altogether, we add their individual amounts:
Beth's money: $70
Jan's money: $60
Total money: $70 + $60 = $130

Answer: $130
