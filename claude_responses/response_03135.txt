Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We need to find the volume of the swimming pool in cubic feet.
   * The pool is 10 feet deep, 6 feet wide, and 20 feet long.
   * Volume = depth x width x length
   * Volume = 10 feet x 6 feet x 20 feet = 1,200 cubic feet

2. We need to convert the volume of the pool from cubic feet to liters.
   * 1 cubic foot = 25 liters
   * 1,200 cubic feet x 25 liters/cubic foot = 30,000 liters

3. We need to find the cost of filling the pool with bottled water.
   * The cost of 1 liter of water is $3.
   * 30,000 liters x $3/liter = $90,000

Answer: $90,000
