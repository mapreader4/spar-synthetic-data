Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sue has 7 purple beads
2) She has twice as many blue beads as purple beads. So, the number of blue beads is 2 x 7 = 14 beads.
3) She has 11 more green beads than blue beads. So, the number of green beads is 14 + 11 = 25 beads.
4) To find the total number of beads in the necklace, we add up the number of purple, blue, and green beads:
7 purple beads + 14 blue beads + 25 green beads = 46 beads

Answer: 46
