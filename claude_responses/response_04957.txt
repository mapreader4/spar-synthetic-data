Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, Jan's speed was 70 skips per minute
* After training, her speed doubled, which means it is now 70 x 2 = 140 skips per minute
* The question asks how many skips she does in 5 minutes
* To calculate this, we take her new speed of 140 skips per minute and multiply it by 5 minutes
* 140 skips per minute x 5 minutes = 700 skips

Answer: 700
