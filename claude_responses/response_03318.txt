Okay, let's break this down step by step:

Last night, Kannon had:
* 3 apples
* 1 banana
* 4 oranges

Today, she is planning to have:
* 4 more apples than last night, which is 3 + 4 = 7 apples
* 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which is 1 x 10 = 10 bananas
* Twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which is 7 x 2 = 14 oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits she would have eaten so far in the two meals:
* Last night: 3 apples + 1 banana + 4 oranges = 8 fruits
* Today: 7 apples + 10 bananas + 14 oranges = 31 fruits
* Total: 8 + 31 = 39 fruits

Answer: 39
