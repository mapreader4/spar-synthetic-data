Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jonah bought 6 pineapples for $3 each, so the total cost of the pineapples is:
6 pineapples x $3 per pineapple = $18
2) Each pineapple can be cut into 12 pineapple rings, so the total number of pineapple rings is:
6 pineapples x 12 rings per pineapple = 72 pineapple rings
3) Jonah sold 4 pineapple rings for $5 each, so the total revenue is:
4 rings x $5 per ring = $20
4) The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$20 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $2

Answer: $2
