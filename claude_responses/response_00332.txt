Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dorothy earns $60,000 a year from her work.
2) She needs to pay 18% of this amount in taxes.
3) To calculate the amount of taxes she needs to pay, we take 18% of $60,000:
   * 18% of $60,000 = 0.18 * $60,000 = $10,800
4) Now, to calculate the amount of money she will have left after paying the taxes, we subtract the taxes from her total earnings:
   * $60,000 - $10,800 = $49,200

Answer: $49,200
