Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Maddie makes 2 cups of coffee per day.
2. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans.
3. So, Maddie uses 3 ounces of coffee beans per day (2 cups x 1.5 ounces per cup).
4. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans.
5. Therefore, Maddie uses 21 ounces of coffee beans per week (3 ounces per day x 7 days).
6. Since a bag of coffee contains 10.5 ounces of beans, Maddie needs to buy 2 bags of coffee per week (21 ounces / 10.5 ounces per bag = 2 bags).
7. 2 bags of coffee at $8 per bag is $16 per week for the coffee beans.
8. Maddie also uses 1/2 gallon of milk per week, and a gallon of milk costs $4.
9. Therefore, the cost of the milk per week is $2 (1/2 gallon x $4 per gallon).
10. Adding the cost of the coffee beans ($16) and the cost of the milk ($2), the total amount Maddie spends on her coffee per week is:

Answer: $18
