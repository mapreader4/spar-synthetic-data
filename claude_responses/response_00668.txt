Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The box is 8 inches in height, 10 inches in width, and 12 inches in length.
2) The wooden building block is 3 inches in height, 2 inches in width, and 4 inches in length.
3) To find how many building blocks can fit into the box, we need to determine how many blocks can fit in each dimension of the box.
4) In the height dimension, the box is 8 inches tall, and each block is 3 inches tall. So we can fit 8 / 3 = 2.67 blocks in the height dimension. Since we can only have whole blocks, we round down to 2 blocks.
5) In the width dimension, the box is 10 inches wide, and each block is 2 inches wide. So we can fit 10 / 2 = 5 blocks in the width dimension.
6) In the length dimension, the box is 12 inches long, and each block is 4 inches long. So we can fit 12 / 4 = 3 blocks in the length dimension.
7) To find the total number of blocks that can fit in the box, we multiply the number of blocks in each dimension: 2 x 5 x 3 = 30.

Answer: 30
