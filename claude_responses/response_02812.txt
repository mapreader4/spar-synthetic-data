Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jewel bought 10 magazines at $3 each.
2) The total cost of the 10 magazines is:
   10 magazines x $3 per magazine = $30
3) Jewel is selling each magazine for $3.50.
4) The total revenue from selling the 10 magazines is:
   10 magazines x $3.50 per magazine = $35
5) The gain or profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
   $35 (total revenue) - $30 (total cost) = $5
Answer: $5
