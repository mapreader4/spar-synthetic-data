Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute
* The brown rabbit can hop 12 meters in one minute
* We want to find the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes
* To find the total distance, we need to calculate the distance each rabbit will hop in 5 minutes, and then add them together
* The white rabbit will hop 15 meters per minute, so in 5 minutes it will hop 15 * 5 = 75 meters
* The brown rabbit will hop 12 meters per minute, so in 5 minutes it will hop 12 * 5 = 60 meters
* The total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes is 75 + 60 = 135 meters
