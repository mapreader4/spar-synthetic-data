Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marie has 4 notebooks with 20 stamps each
* So the total number of stamps in the notebooks is:
  * 4 notebooks x 20 stamps per notebook = 80 stamps
* Marie also has 2 binders with 50 stamps each
* So the total number of stamps in the binders is:
  * 2 binders x 50 stamps per binder = 100 stamps
* The total number of stamps Marie has is:
  * 80 stamps (notebooks) + 100 stamps (binders) = 180 stamps
* Marie decides to keep 1/4 of the stamps
* 1/4 of 180 stamps is:
  * 180 stamps / 4 = 45 stamps
* Therefore, Marie can give away:
  * 180 stamps - 45 stamps = 135 stamps

Answer: 135
