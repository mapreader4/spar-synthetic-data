Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Billy picks 36 dandelions initially.
2. George picks 1/3 as many as Billy, which means George picks 36 * 1/3 = 12 dandelions initially.
3. After seeing the pile, they each decide to pick 10 more.
   - Billy now has 36 + 10 = 46 dandelions.
   - George now has 12 + 10 = 22 dandelions.
4. To find the average, we add the total number of dandelions picked and divide by the number of people:
   - Total dandelions picked = 46 + 22 = 68
   - Number of people = 2
   - Average = 68 / 2 = 34

Answer: 34
