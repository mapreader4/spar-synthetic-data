Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chandler can eat 23 apples per week
* Lucy can eat 19 apples per week
* The farmer delivers 1 time per month
* To find the total number of apples they need to order for a month, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of apples they can eat in a week:
   * Chandler: 23 apples
   * Lucy: 19 apples
   * Total per week: 23 + 19 = 42 apples
2. Since the farmer delivers 1 time per month, we need to multiply the weekly total by 4 weeks to get the monthly total:
   * 42 apples per week x 4 weeks = 168 apples per month

Answer: 168 apples
