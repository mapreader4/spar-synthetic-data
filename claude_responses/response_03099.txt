Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Natasha exercised for 30 minutes every day for one week.
   * 1 week = 7 days
   * 30 minutes per day for 7 days
   * 30 minutes x 7 days = 210 minutes

2. Esteban exercised for 10 minutes on each of nine days.
   * 10 minutes per day for 9 days
   * 10 minutes x 9 days = 90 minutes

3. Now we need to add the total minutes for Natasha and Esteban:
   * 210 minutes + 90 minutes = 300 minutes

4. To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
   * 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Answer: 5 hours
