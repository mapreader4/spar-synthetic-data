Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The wallet costs $22.
2) The purse costs $3 less than four times the cost of the wallet.
   * The cost of the wallet is $22.
   * Four times the cost of the wallet is 4 * $22 = $88.
   * $88 - $3 = $85.
   * So the purse costs $85.
3) The combined cost of the wallet and the purse is:
   * Wallet cost: $22
   * Purse cost: $85
   * Total cost: $22 + $85 = $107

Answer: 107
