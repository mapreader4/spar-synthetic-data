Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt made 2-point shots four times
* Each 2-point shot is worth 2 points
* So, for the 2-point shots, he scored 4 x 2 = 8 points
* Matt also made 3-point shots twice
* Each 3-point shot is worth 3 points
* So, for the 3-point shots, he scored 2 x 3 = 6 points
* To calculate the total points scored in the quarter, we add the points from the 2-point shots and the 3-point shots:
* 8 points + 6 points = 14 points

Answer: 14
