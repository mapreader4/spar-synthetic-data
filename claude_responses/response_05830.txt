Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hansel's album originally had 25 songs
* Each song is 3 minutes long
* So the total duration of the original 25 songs is:
    * 25 songs x 3 minutes per song = 75 minutes
* Hansel then adds 10 more songs to the album
* Each of these 10 new songs is also 3 minutes long
* So the total duration of the 10 new songs is:
    * 10 songs x 3 minutes per song = 30 minutes
* To find the total duration of the entire album, we add the duration of the original 25 songs and the 10 new songs:
    * 75 minutes + 30 minutes = 105 minutes

Answer: 105
