Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The necklace has a total of 40 beads.
2) There are three kinds of beads: amethyst, amber, and turquoise.
3) There are 7 amethyst beads.
4) There are twice as many amber beads as amethyst beads. So, the number of amber beads is 2 x 7 = 14.
5) The remaining beads must be turquoise. To find the number of turquoise beads, we subtract the amethyst and amber beads from the total:
   Total beads - amethyst beads - amber beads = turquoise beads
   40 - 7 - 14 = 19

Answer: 19 turquoise beads.
