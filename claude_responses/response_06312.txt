Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Phillip has 40 apples.
2) Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip, so Ben has 40 + 8 = 48 apples.
3) Tom has three-eighths as many apples as Ben. 
4) To calculate three-eighths of 48, we take 48 and divide it by 8, then multiply the result by 3.
5) 48 / 8 = 6
6) 6 * 3 = 18

Answer: 18 apples.
