Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The drink is made of 2 parts Coke, 1 part Sprite, and 3 parts Mountain Dew.
2) We know that the drink contains 6 ounces of Coke.
3) Since the drink is 2 parts Coke, 1 part Sprite, and 3 parts Mountain Dew, we can represent the total parts as 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 parts.
4) If the Coke portion is 6 ounces, and it is 2 parts out of the total 6 parts, then the total volume of the drink is 6 ounces / (2/6) = 18 ounces.

Answer: 18 ounces.
