Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 100 students in the class.
2) The ratio of boys to girls is 3:2.
3) To find the number of boys, we can use the ratio. The total parts in the ratio is 3 + 2 = 5.
4) So the number of boys is (3/5) * 100 = 60.
5) The number of girls is (2/5) * 100 = 40.
6) To find the difference between the number of boys and girls, we subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:
60 - 40 = 20.

Answer: 20
