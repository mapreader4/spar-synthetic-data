Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lulu started with $65 in her piggy bank.
2) She spent $5 on ice cream, so now she has $65 - $5 = $60 remaining.
3) She then spent half of the remaining money on a t-shirt, so she spent $60 / 2 = $30 on the t-shirt.
4) Now she has $60 - $30 = $30 remaining.
5) She then deposited a fifth of her remaining money at the bank. A fifth of $30 is $30 / 5 = $6.
6) So she deposited $6 at the bank, leaving her with $30 - $6 = $24 in cash.

Answer: $24
