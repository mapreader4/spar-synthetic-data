Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John won $155250 in the lottery.
2) He decided to give one-thousandth of the $155250 to each of the top 100 students in his college.
3) To calculate the amount given to each student, we take the total amount ($155250) and divide it by 1,000 (one-thousandth).
4) $155250 / 1,000 = $155.25 per student.
5) Since there are 100 students, we multiply the amount per student ($155.25) by 100 to get the total amount received by the hundred students.
6) $155.25 * 100 = $15,525.

Answer: 15,525
