Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The track is 400 meters long
* Bob ran the first lap in 70 seconds
* Bob ran the second and third laps in 85 seconds each
* To calculate his average speed, we need to find the total distance he ran and the total time it took him to run that distance.

The total distance:
* 1 lap = 400 meters
* 3 laps = 3 * 400 = 1200 meters

The total time:
* First lap = 70 seconds
* Second lap = 85 seconds
* Third lap = 85 seconds
* Total time = 70 + 85 + 85 = 240 seconds

Now we can calculate his average speed:
* Average speed = Total distance / Total time
* Average speed = 1200 meters / 240 seconds
* Average speed = 5 meters/second

Answer: 5 m/s
