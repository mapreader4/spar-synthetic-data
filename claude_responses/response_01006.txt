Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jayson is 10 years old
* His dad is four times Jayson's age, which means his dad is 40 years old (4 x 10 = 40)
* His mom is 2 years younger than his dad, which means his mom is 38 years old (40 - 2 = 38)

To find out how old Jayson's mom was when he was born, we need to subtract Jayson's age from his mom's age:
* Jayson's mom's age when he was born = 38 - 10 = 28 years old

Answer: 28
