Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The store ordered 300 more than twice as many pens as it did pencils.
   * Let's say the store ordered x pencils.
   * Then the store ordered 2x + 300 pens.
2) The cost of a pen is $5 and the cost of a pencil is $4.
3) The store ordered 15 boxes, each having 80 pencils.
   * So the total number of pencils ordered is 15 * 80 = 1200 pencils.
4) The total cost of the pencils is 1200 * $4 = $4,800.
5) The total cost of the pens is (2x + 300) * $5.
6) The total amount of money they paid for the stationery is the sum of the cost of the pencils and the cost of the pens:
   * Total cost = $4,800 + (2x + 300) * $5

Answer: 24,800
