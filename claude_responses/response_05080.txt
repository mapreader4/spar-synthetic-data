Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kimmie received $450 from her handmade crafts at the supermarket.
2) Zahra received 1/3 less money than Kimmie when she sold the same amount of handmade crafts at Etsy.
   * Zahra's earnings = $450 - (1/3 * $450) = $450 - $150 = $300
3) Both Kimmie and Zahra saved half of their earnings.
   * Kimmie's savings = $450 / 2 = $225
   * Zahra's savings = $300 / 2 = $150
4) The total amount of money in the joint savings account is the sum of Kimmie's and Zahra's savings.
   * Total amount in the joint savings account = $225 + $150 = $375

Answer: 375
