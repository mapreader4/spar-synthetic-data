Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The company needs 1.5 grams of sugar to produce one chocolate bar.
2) The company produces 36 chocolate bars per minute.
3) We want to know how many grams of sugar the company will use in two minutes.
4) In one minute, the company uses 1.5 grams of sugar per chocolate bar * 36 chocolate bars = 54 grams of sugar.
5) In two minutes, the company will use 54 grams of sugar per minute * 2 minutes = 108 grams of sugar.
