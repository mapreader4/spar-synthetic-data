Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cordelia is dyeing her hair red
* To get the desired color, she first has to bleach her dark brown hair to blonde
* Then, she has to apply the dye
* The whole process will take 9 hours
* Dyeing takes twice as long as bleaching

Let's represent the time it takes to bleach her hair as "x" hours.
Since dyeing takes twice as long as bleaching, the time it takes to dye her hair is "2x" hours.

The total time for the whole process is 9 hours, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x = 9

Solving for x:
3x = 9
x = 3

Therefore, it will take Cordelia 3 hours to bleach her hair.
