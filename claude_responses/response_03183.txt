Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 400 students total
* 120 students take dance as their elective
* 200 students take art as their elective
* The rest take music

To find the number of students who take music, we need to subtract the number of students taking dance and art from the total number of students:
* 400 - 120 - 200 = 80 students take music

Now, to find the percentage of students who take music, we divide the number of students taking music by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
* (80 / 400) * 100 = 20%

Answer: 20%
