Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 100 people who attended the party
* 50% of the attendees are women
* 35% of the attendees are men
* The rest are children

First, let's calculate the number of women:
* 50% of 100 people = 0.5 * 100 = 50 women

Next, let's calculate the number of men:
* 35% of 100 people = 0.35 * 100 = 35 men

Now, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of women and men from the total number of attendees:
* 100 - 50 - 35 = 15 children

Answer: 15
