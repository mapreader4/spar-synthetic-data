Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bear needs to gain 1000 pounds to prepare for hibernation.
* During the summer, the bear gained a fifth of the 1000 pounds it needed from berries.
* 1/5 of 1000 pounds = 200 pounds gained from berries.
* During the autumn, the bear gained twice the amount it gained from berries, which is 2 * 200 = 400 pounds from acorns.
* The remaining weight the bear needed to gain was 1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 pounds.
* Salmon made up half of the remaining 400 pounds, which is 200 pounds.
* The remaining 200 pounds were gained from small woodland animals.

Answer: 200 pounds
