Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) Joseph drives his car at 50 mph for 2.5 hours.
   * To find the distance Joseph drives, we multiply his speed (50 mph) by the time he drives (2.5 hours).
   * 50 mph x 2.5 hours = 125 miles

2) Kyle drives his car at 62 mph for 2 hours.
   * To find the distance Kyle drives, we multiply his speed (62 mph) by the time he drives (2 hours).
   * 62 mph x 2 hours = 124 miles

3) To find how many more miles Joseph drives than Kyle, we subtract Kyle's distance from Joseph's distance.
   * 125 miles - 124 miles = 1 mile
