Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cassy packs 12 jars of jam in 10 boxes.
2) This means she packs a total of 12 * 10 = 120 jars of jam in the 10 boxes.
3) Cassy also packs 10 jars of jam in 30 boxes.
4) This means she packs a total of 10 * 30 = 300 jars of jam in the 30 boxes.
5) In total, Cassy has packed 120 + 300 = 420 jars of jam in the boxes.
6) Cassy has 500 jars of jam in total.
7) Therefore, the number of jars of jam she has left when all the boxes are full is:
500 - 420 = 80 jars of jam.

Answer: 80
