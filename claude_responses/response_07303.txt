Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mr. Llesis had 50 kilograms of rice.
2) He kept 7/10 of the rice in storage.
3) To find how much rice he kept in storage, we multiply the total amount of rice (50 kg) by 7/10:
50 kg * 7/10 = 35 kg
4) The remaining amount of rice that he gave to Mr. Everest is the total amount (50 kg) minus the amount he kept in storage (35 kg):
50 kg - 35 kg = 15 kg
5) Therefore, the amount of rice Mr. Llesis kept is 35 kg, and the amount he gave to Mr. Everest is 15 kg.
6) The difference between the amount Mr. Llesis kept and the amount he gave to Mr. Everest is:
35 kg - 15 kg = 20 kg

Answer: 20 kg
