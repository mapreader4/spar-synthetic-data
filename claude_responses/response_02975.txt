Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.
2) Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.
3) Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red.
4) So, Tanya has 10 red erasers.
5) Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.
6) One-half of 10 is 5, and 5 minus 3 is 2.
7) So, Rachel has 2 erasers.
8) Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel, so Hanna has 2 x 2 = 4 erasers.
