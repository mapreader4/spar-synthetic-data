Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tuition cost per semester: $22,000
* Nancy's parents can pay half the cost: $22,000 / 2 = $11,000
* Nancy can get a scholarship for: $3,000 per semester
* Nancy can get a student loan for: 2 x $3,000 = $6,000 per semester
* Total amount covered by scholarship and loan: $3,000 + $6,000 = $9,000
* Amount Nancy has to pay: $22,000 - $11,000 - $9,000 = $2,000
* Nancy can work a total of 200 hours during the semester
* To calculate the amount Nancy has to make per hour:
* Amount Nancy has to pay: $2,000
* Hours Nancy can work: 200
* Amount Nancy has to make per hour: $2,000 / 200 = $10

Answer: $10
