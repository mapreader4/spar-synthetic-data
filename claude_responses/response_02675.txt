Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jayden received 300 coins.
2) Jason was paid 60 more coins than Jayden.
3) To find the number of coins Jason received, we add 60 to the number of coins Jayden received:
   * Jason's coins = Jayden's coins + 60
   * Jason's coins = 300 + 60 = 360 coins
4) To find the total number of coins Mrs. Jane gave to the boys, we add Jayden's coins and Jason's coins:
   * Total coins = Jayden's coins + Jason's coins
   * Total coins = 300 + 360 = 660 coins

Answer: 660 coins
