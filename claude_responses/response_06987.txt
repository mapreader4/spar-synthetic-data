Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 500 salmon in river Trout.
* The total number of salmon has increased by ten times the initial number.
* To calculate the new total number of salmon, we take the initial number (500) and multiply it by 10.
* 500 x 10 = 5,000 salmon.

Therefore, the total number of fish in the river now is:
Answer: 5,000
