Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* John gave the store $20
* Slurpees cost $2 each
* He received $8 in change
To find the number of Slurpees he bought, we need to first find the total amount he spent on Slurpees.
* Total amount spent = Amount given - Amount received in change
* Total amount spent = $20 - $8 = $12
* Since each Slurpee costs $2, the number of Slurpees he bought is the total amount spent divided by the cost of each Slurpee.
* Number of Slurpees = $12 / $2 = 6

Answer: 6
