Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The kitten was 4 inches when he was found
* In the next two weeks, he doubled in length
* 4 inches x 2 = 8 inches
* By 4 months old, he had doubled in length again
* 8 inches x 2 = 16 inches

Therefore, the kitten's current length is:
Answer: 16 inches
