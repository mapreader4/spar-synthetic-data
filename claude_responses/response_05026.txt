Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aang caught 7 fish
* Sokka caught 5 fish
* Toph caught 12 fish
* To find the average, we need to add up the total number of fish caught and divide by the number of people.
* The total number of fish caught is 7 + 5 + 12 = 24 fish.
* There are 3 people (Aang, Sokka, and Toph).
* To find the average, we divide the total number of fish (24) by the number of people (3).
* 24 รท 3 = 8
