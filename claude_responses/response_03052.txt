Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hannah brought $30 to the county fair.
2) She spent half of the $30 on rides. Half of $30 is $15, so she spent $15 on rides.
3) She then spent an additional $5 on dessert.
4) To calculate the amount left, we take the initial $30 and subtract the $15 spent on rides and the $5 spent on dessert.
5) $30 - $15 - $5 = $10.

Answer: $10.
