Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mason is 20 years old.
2) Mason is three times younger than Sydney, so Sydney is 3 times older than Mason.
3) If Mason is 20 years old, then Sydney is 3 x 20 = 60 years old.
4) Sydney is 6 years younger than Mason's father, so Mason's father is 6 years older than Sydney.
5) If Sydney is 60 years old, then Mason's father is 60 + 6 = 66 years old.

Answer: 66
