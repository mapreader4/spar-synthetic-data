Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The computer factory produces 1500 computers per day
* They sell each computer for $150
* We need to find the total money earned from selling 1 week's worth of production

To calculate the total money earned, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of computers produced in 1 week
2. Multiply the total number of computers by the price per computer

Step 1: Calculate the total number of computers produced in 1 week
* There are 7 days in a week
* 1500 computers per day x 7 days = 10,500 computers

Step 2: Multiply the total number of computers by the price per computer
* 10,500 computers x $150 per computer = $1,575,000

Answer: $1,575,000
