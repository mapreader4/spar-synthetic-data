Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ariel was born in 1992
* She began fencing in 2006
* She has been fencing for 16 years
* To find her current age, we need to add the number of years she has been fencing to the year she was born.
* 1992 (year of birth) + 16 (years of fencing) = 2008
* Therefore, Ariel is currently 16 years old.
