Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Talia's house is 5 miles from the park where she is playing football.
2) After the game, Talia plans to go to the grocery store, which is 3 miles away from the park.
3) The grocery store is 8 miles away from Talia's house.
4) To calculate the total distance Talia drives, we need to add up the distances:
* From Talia's house to the park: 5 miles
* From the park to the grocery store: 3 miles
* From the grocery store back to Talia's house: 8 miles
* Total distance = 5 + 3 + 8 = 16 miles

Answer: 16
