Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Brad's zip code consists of five numbers that add up to 10.
2) The first and second numbers are the same.
3) The third number is zero.
4) The fourth number is double the first number.
5) The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8.

Let's start by assigning the first number as x.
* The second number is also x.
* The third number is 0.
* The fourth number is 2x.
* The fifth number is 8 - 2x.

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x:
x + x + 0 + 2x + (8 - 2x) = 10
4x + 8 - 2x = 10
2x = 2
x = 1

So the first and second numbers are 1, the third number is 0, the fourth number is 2, and the fifth number is 6.
