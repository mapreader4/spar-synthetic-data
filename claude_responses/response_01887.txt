Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first math problem had an answer of 600.

2. The second math problem had an answer that was twice as big as the first problem, which means the answer for the second problem is 600 x 2 = 1200.

3. The third math problem had an answer that was 400 less than the combined total answers of the first and second problems. The combined total of the first and second problems is 600 + 1200 = 1800. The answer for the third problem is 1800 - 400 = 1400.

Now, to find the total of August's answers from solving the three math problems, we add up the answers for all three problems:

600 + 1200 + 1400 = 3200

Answer: 3200
