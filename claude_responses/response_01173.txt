Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Audrey was asleep for 10 hours last night
* She dreamed for 2/5 of the time she was asleep
* To find how much of the night she was not dreaming, we need to subtract the time she was dreaming from the total time she was asleep

First, let's calculate the time she was dreaming:
* 2/5 of 10 hours = 2/5 * 10 = 4 hours

Now, we can subtract the time she was dreaming from the total time she was asleep:
* 10 hours - 4 hours = 6 hours

Therefore, Audrey was not dreaming for 6 hours of the night.

Answer: 6
