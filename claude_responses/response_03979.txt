Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Alvarez spends $36 on diesel fuel each week.
2) The cost of diesel fuel is $3 per gallon.
3) To find the number of gallons of diesel fuel used in one week, we divide the weekly cost by the cost per gallon:
$36 / $3 per gallon = 12 gallons per week
4) To find the number of gallons used in two weeks, we multiply the gallons per week by 2:
12 gallons per week x 2 weeks = 24 gallons

Answer: 24
