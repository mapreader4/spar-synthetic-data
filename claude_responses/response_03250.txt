Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James has 4 packs of stickers, and each pack has 30 stickers.
2) So the total number of stickers James has is 4 * 30 = 120 stickers.
3) Each sticker costs $0.10.
4) So the total cost of the stickers is 120 * $0.10 = $12.
5) James' friend pays for half of the cost.
6) Therefore, James pays for the other half, which is $12 / 2 = $6.
