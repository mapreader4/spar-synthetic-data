Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sonja uses a ratio of 2 ounces of oil to 8 ounces of peanuts
* This means that for every 10 ounces of total ingredients (8 ounces of peanuts + 2 ounces of oil), she uses 2 ounces of oil
* The last batch of peanut butter weighed 20 ounces
* To find the amount of oil used, we can set up a proportion:
* 10 ounces total ingredients : 2 ounces oil = 20 ounces total ingredients : x ounces oil
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 10x = 40
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = 4 ounces of oil
