Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first year, Thomas's weekly allowance was $50. Over the course of the year, this amounts to:
   * $50 per week x 52 weeks = $2,600

2. In the second year, Thomas got a job at a coffee shop, working 30 hours per week at $9 per hour. His weekly income from this job was:
   * $9 per hour x 30 hours per week = $270 per week

3. Over the course of the second year, Thomas's income from his job was:
   * $270 per week x 52 weeks = $14,040

4. During the two years, Thomas spent $35 per week on himself. Over the course of the two years, this amounts to:
   * $35 per week x 104 weeks = $3,640

5. To calculate the total amount of money Thomas has saved over the two years:
   * Year 1 allowance: $2,600
   * Year 2 job income: $14,040
   * Total savings: $2,600 + $14,040 = $16,640

6. The car Thomas wants to buy costs $15,000. To calculate how much more money he needs:
   * Car cost: $15,000
   * Total savings: $16,640
   * Difference: $15,000 - $16,640 = -$1,640

Answer: -$1,640

Thomas has saved $1,640 more than the cost of the car, so he does not need any additional money to buy the car.
