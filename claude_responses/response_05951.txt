Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The book has 158 pages
* Cora read 23 pages on Monday
* Cora read 38 pages on Tuesday
* Cora read 61 pages on Wednesday
* Cora will read twice as much on Friday as she does on Thursday

So, the total number of pages Cora has read so far is:
* 23 + 38 + 61 = 122 pages

That means she has 158 - 122 = 36 pages left to read.

We know that she will read twice as much on Friday as she does on Thursday. Let's call the number of pages she reads on Thursday 'x'.
* Then, the number of pages she reads on Friday will be 2x.

The total number of pages she reads on Thursday and Friday must be 36, since that's all she has left to read.
* x + 2x = 36
* 3x = 36
* x = 12

Therefore, Cora needs to read 12 pages on Thursday to finish the book in time.

Answer: 12
