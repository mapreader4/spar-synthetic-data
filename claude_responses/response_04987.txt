Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The current price of a bottle of wine is $20.00
* In 2 months, the price of wine will increase by 25%
* We want to find how much more expensive 5 bottles of wine will be in 2 months

First, let's calculate the new price of a single bottle of wine after the 25% increase:
* 25% of $20.00 = 0.25 * $20.00 = $5.00
* New price of a bottle of wine = $20.00 + $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 5 bottles of wine at the new price:
* 5 bottles of wine at $25.00 each = 5 * $25.00 = $125.00

Finally, let's calculate how much more expensive 5 bottles of wine will be in 2 months:
* Original cost of 5 bottles of wine = 5 * $20.00 = $100.00
* New cost of 5 bottles of wine = $125.00
* Difference in cost = $125.00 - $100.00 = $25.00

Answer: $25.00
