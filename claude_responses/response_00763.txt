Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Josh has 18 yards of ribbon
* The ribbon is to be used equally for 6 gifts
* Each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon

To find the amount of ribbon left, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for all 6 gifts
2. Subtract the total amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for all 6 gifts
* Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon
* 6 gifts x 2 yards per gift = 12 yards of ribbon used

Step 2: Subtract the total amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has
* 18 yards of ribbon - 12 yards of ribbon used = 6 yards of ribbon left

Answer: 6
