Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joel's garden is 64 square feet large.
2) He wants to use half of the garden for fruits and half for vegetables.
   - So the fruit section is 32 square feet (half of 64 square feet).
   - The vegetable section is also 32 square feet.
3) He wants to use a quarter of the fruit section for strawberries.
   - A quarter of 32 square feet is 8 square feet.
