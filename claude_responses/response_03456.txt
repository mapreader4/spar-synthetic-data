Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The teacher divided the students into four groups
* The first group had 5 students
* The second group had 8 students
* The third group had 7 students
* The total number of students is 24

To find the number of students in the fourth group, we need to subtract the number of students in the first three groups from the total number of students.

The total number of students in the first three groups is:
* 5 + 8 + 7 = 20 students

Now, we subtract the number of students in the first three groups from the total number of students to get the number of students in the fourth group:
* 24 - 20 = 4 students

Answer: 4
