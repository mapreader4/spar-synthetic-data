Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Josh's mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall.
2) He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2.
3) That means he has spent $10 + $2 = $12 so far.
4) He then buys four cookies, and each cookie costs $1.25.
5) So the total cost of the four cookies is 4 x $1.25 = $5.
6) Now, we add up the total amount he has spent: $12 + $5 = $17.
7) Finally, we subtract the total amount he spent from the original $20 he was given:
$20 - $17 = $3.
