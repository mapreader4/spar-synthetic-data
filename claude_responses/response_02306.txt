Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The cost of each child's ticket is $4.25.
2. The cost of each adult ticket is $3.25 more than the child's ticket, which means $4.25 + $3.25 = $7.50.
3. They bought 2 adult tickets and 4 children's tickets, so the total cost before the discount would be:
   - 2 adult tickets x $7.50 = $15.00
   - 4 children's tickets x $4.25 = $17.00
   - Total before discount = $15.00 + $17.00 = $32.00
4. They were given a $2 discount for buying more than 3 tickets.
5. The total cost after the discount is $32.00 - $2.00 = $30.00.

Answer: $30
