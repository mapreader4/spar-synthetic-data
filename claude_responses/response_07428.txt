Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gerald had 20 toy cars initially.
* He donated 1/4 of his toy cars to an orphanage.
* To calculate how many toy cars he donated, we take 1/4 of 20:
* 1/4 of 20 = 20 * 1/4 = 5 toy cars
* So, Gerald donated 5 toy cars to the orphanage.
* To calculate how many toy cars Gerald has left, we subtract the number of toy cars he donated from the initial number of toy cars he had:
* 20 - 5 = 15 toy cars

Answer: 15
