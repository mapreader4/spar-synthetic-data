Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alicia bought 2 math books, 3 art books, and 6 science books
* The total cost of all the books is $30
* The math books and science books each cost $3 each

First, let's calculate the total cost of the math books and science books:
* 2 math books x $3 per book = $6
* 6 science books x $3 per book = $18
* Total cost of math and science books = $6 + $18 = $24

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the art books by subtracting the cost of the math and science books from the total cost:
* Total cost - Cost of math and science books = Cost of art books
* $30 - $24 = $6

Finally, we can calculate the cost of each art book by dividing the total cost of the art books by the number of art books:
* Cost of art books / Number of art books = Cost per art book
* $6 / 3 = $2

Answer: $2
