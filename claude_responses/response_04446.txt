Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hans reserved a table for 12 people
* The deposit is a flat $20 plus an extra $3 per adult and $1 per child
* 2 of the people in Hans's party are his kid cousins (children)
* The remaining 10 people are adults

First, let's calculate the extra deposit for the adults:
* 10 adults x $3 per adult = $30

Next, let's calculate the extra deposit for the children:
* 2 children x $1 per child = $2

Now, we can add the flat $20 deposit, the adult deposit, and the child deposit:
* $20 + $30 + $2 = $52

Therefore, the total deposit that Hans has to pay for the restaurant reservation is:
Answer: $52
