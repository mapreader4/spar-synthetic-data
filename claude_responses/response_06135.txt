Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The trader initially had 55 bags of rice in stock.
2) She then sold off some bags of rice and restocked 132 bags.
3) After the selling and restocking, she now has 164 bags of rice.
4) To find out how many bags of rice she sold, we can use the following equation:
Initial Bags - Bags Sold + Restocked Bags = Final Bags
5) Plugging in the values, we get:
55 - Bags Sold + 132 = 164
6) Solving for Bags Sold, we get:
Bags Sold = 55 + 132 - 164 = 23

Answer: 23
