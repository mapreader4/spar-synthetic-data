Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Donaldsons pay $15 per hour for babysitting
* Layla babysat for the Donaldsons for 7 hours
* So, for the Donaldsons, Layla earned:
    - 7 hours x $15 per hour = $105
* The Merck family pays $18 per hour for babysitting
* Layla babysat for the Merck family for 6 hours
* So, for the Merck family, Layla earned:
    - 6 hours x $18 per hour = $108
* The Hille family pays $20 per hour for babysitting
* Layla babysat for the Hille family for 3 hours
* So, for the Hille family, Layla earned:
    - 3 hours x $20 per hour = $60
* To calculate the total amount Layla earned babysitting, we add up the amounts for each family:
    - $105 + $108 + $60 = $273

Answer: $273
