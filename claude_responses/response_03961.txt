Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janet walks 3 blocks north
2) She then walks 7 times as many blocks west, which is 7 * 3 = 21 blocks west
3) She then turns around and walks 8 blocks south
4) She then walks twice as many blocks east as she did west, which is 2 * 21 = 42 blocks east
5) In total, she walked:
   - 3 blocks north
   - 21 blocks west
   - 8 blocks south
   - 42 blocks east
6) Since Janet can walk 2 blocks/minute, we can calculate the total time it takes her to get home:
   - Total blocks walked = 3 + 21 + 8 + 42 = 74 blocks
   - Time taken = 74 blocks / 2 blocks/minute = 37 minutes

Answer: 37 minutes
