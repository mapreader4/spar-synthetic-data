Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The theater has a capacity of 400 seats.
2. They fill the theater to 80% capacity.
   - 80% of 400 seats = 0.8 * 400 = 320 seats filled
3. Each ticket costs $30.
4. They repeated the same performance 2 other days.
   - So they had a total of 3 performances.
5. To calculate the total revenue:
   - Revenue per performance = 320 seats * $30 per ticket = $9,600
   - Total revenue = $9,600 * 3 performances = $28,800

Answer: $28,800
