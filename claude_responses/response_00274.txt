Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina.
2) This means that if Amanda had 12 more marbles, she would have 2 times as many marbles as Katrina.
3) Let's call the number of marbles Katrina has as "x".
4) Then, Amanda would have 2x marbles if she had 12 more.
5) So, Amanda currently has 2x - 12 marbles.
6) Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, so Mabel has 5x marbles.
7) We are told that Mabel has 85 marbles, so 5x = 85.
8) Solving for x, we get x = 17.
9) Therefore, Amanda has 2(17) - 12 = 22 marbles.
10) Mabel has 5(17) = 85 marbles.
11) The difference between Mabel's marbles and Amanda's marbles is 85 - 22 = 63.

Answer: 63
