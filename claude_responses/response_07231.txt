Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tyler has $100 to start with.
2) He buys 8 scissors at $5 each. So the total cost of the scissors is 8 x $5 = $40.
3) He also buys 10 erasers at $4 each. So the total cost of the erasers is 10 x $4 = $40.
4) The total amount Tyler has spent is $40 (scissors) + $40 (erasers) = $80.
5) To calculate how much money remains, we take the initial $100 and subtract the $80 he spent.
Answer: $20
