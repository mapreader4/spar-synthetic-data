Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 25 students in Mary's class
* The teacher told them they could pay $50 each to finance a science project
* All students paid the full amount except for 4 students
* The 4 students who did not pay the full amount paid half, which is $25 each

First, let's calculate the total amount paid by the 21 students who paid the full $50 amount:
* 21 students x $50 = $1,050

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid by the 4 students who paid half:
* 4 students x $25 = $100

Now, we can add the two amounts together to get the total amount the class was able to gather:
* $1,050 + $100 = $1,150

Answer: $1,150
