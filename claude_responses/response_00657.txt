Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pete has to take a 10-minute walk down to the train station.
2) Then he has to board a 1hr 20-minute train to LA.
3) He cannot get to LA later than 0900 hours (9:00 AM).
4) So, the latest time he can arrive at LA is 0900 hours.
5) Subtracting the 1hr 20-minute train ride from 0900 hours, we get 0740 hours (7:40 AM) as the latest time he can board the train.
6) Subtracting the 10-minute walk from 0740 hours, we get 0730 hours (7:30 AM) as the latest time he should leave his house.

Answer: 0730 hours
