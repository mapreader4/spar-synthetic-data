Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 120 conference attendees in total.
2) We also know that there are 4 more male attendees than female attendees.
3) Let's represent the number of female attendees as x.
4) Then the number of male attendees would be x + 4.
5) The total number of attendees is 120, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 4) = 120
6) Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 4 = 120
7) Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
2x = 116
8) Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 58
9) So the number of female attendees is 58.
10) The number of male attendees is 58 + 4 = 62.

Answer: 62
