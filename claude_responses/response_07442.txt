Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sally has $320 to spend on books for her 30 students
* Each reading book costs $12
* To calculate the total cost of buying a reading book for each student, we multiply the cost per book ($12) by the number of students (30):
* Total cost = $12 x 30 = $360
* Now, we need to compare the total cost ($360) to the amount of money Sally has ($320)
* The difference between the total cost and the amount of money Sally has is the amount she needs to pay out of pocket:
* Amount Sally needs to pay out of pocket = $360 - $320 = $40

Answer: $40
