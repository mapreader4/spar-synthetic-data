Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Darryl started the day with 30 cantaloupes and 27 honeydews
* He accidentally dropped a couple of cantaloupes, so let's say he had 28 cantaloupes left
* 3 of the honeydews turned out to be rotten, so he had 24 good honeydews left
* At the end of the day, he had 8 cantaloupes and 9 honeydews left
* So he sold:
    - 28 - 8 = 20 cantaloupes
    - 24 - 9 = 15 honeydews
* Cantaloupes are $2 each, so he made:
    - 20 cantaloupes x $2 = $40
* Honeydews are $3 each, so he made:
    - 15 honeydews x $3 = $45
* Total money made:
    - $40 + $45 = $85

Answer: $85
