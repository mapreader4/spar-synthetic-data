Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vinny initially weighed 300 pounds
* In the first month, he lost 20 pounds, so he now weighs 300 - 20 = 280 pounds
* In the second month, he lost half of what he lost in the first month, which is 20 / 2 = 10 pounds, so he now weighs 280 - 10 = 270 pounds
* In the third month, he lost half of what he lost in the second month, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds, so he now weighs 270 - 5 = 265 pounds
* In the fourth month, he lost half of what he lost in the third month, which is 5 / 2 = 2.5 pounds, so he now weighs 265 - 2.5 = 262.5 pounds
* At the start of the fifth month, Vinny weighed 262.5 pounds
* At the end of his diet, Vinny weighed 250.5 pounds
* Therefore, the amount of weight Vinny lost in the fifth month is 262.5 - 250.5 = 12 pounds

Answer: 12 pounds
