Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cost to rent a school bus is $100
* The cost of admission is $10 per student
* The teacher is allowed in for free
* The class has a budget of $350

First, we need to subtract the cost of the school bus rental from the total budget:
* $350 - $100 = $250 remaining

Now, we need to determine how many students can be admitted with the remaining $250 budget.
* The cost of admission is $10 per student
* $250 / $10 per student = 25 students

Therefore, the number of students who can go on the field trip is 25.

Answer: 25
