Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Yuan is 7 years older than his brother David.
2) Yuan is twice his brother David's age.
3) Let's represent David's age as x.
4) Since Yuan is twice David's age, Yuan's age is 2x.
5) Since Yuan is 7 years older than David, we can write the equation: 2x = x + 7.
6) Solving for x, we get: x = 7.
7) Therefore, David is 7 years old.

Answer: 7
