Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The tank is 1/3 full of water initially.
2) To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added.
3) We want to find the total capacity of the tank when it is full.
4) Let's call the total capacity of the tank when full as "x" gallons.
5) Since the tank is 1/3 full initially, that means the initial amount of water in the tank is 1/3 of x gallons.
6) After adding 16 gallons, the tank is now full, so the total amount of water in the tank is x gallons.
7) Therefore, the initial amount of water (1/3 of x) plus the 16 gallons added must equal the total capacity x.
8) Mathematically, this can be expressed as: 1/3 * x + 16 = x
9) Solving for x, we get: 1/3 * x = x - 16
10) Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 3 * (x - 16)
11) Simplifying, we get: x = 3x - 48
12) Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get: -2x = -48
13) Dividing both sides by -2, we get: x = 24
Answer: 24 gallons
