Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The map scale indicates that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance.
2) The distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest on the map is 3 3/8 inches.
3) To find the actual distance between the towns, we need to convert the map distance to actual road distance.
4) Since 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles, we can use the following proportion:
1/4 inch : 8 miles = 3 3/8 inches : x miles
5) Solving for x, we get:
x = (3 3/8 inches * 8 miles) / 1/4 inch
6) Simplifying, we get:
x = (27 miles) / (1/4) = 108 miles.

Answer: 108 miles.
