Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games.
   * Total yards rushed by Malik = 18 yards x 4 games = 72 yards

2. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games.
   * Total yards rushed by Josiah = 22 yards x 4 games = 88 yards

3. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games.
   * Total yards rushed by Darnell = 11 yards x 4 games = 44 yards

4. To find the total yards rushed by all 3 athletes, we add up the individual totals:
   * Total yards rushed = Malik's yards + Josiah's yards + Darnell's yards
   * Total yards rushed = 72 yards + 88 yards + 44 yards = 204 yards

Answer: 204 yards
