Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pete walks backwards three times faster than Susan walks forwards.
2) Tracy does one-handed cartwheels twice as fast as Susan walks forwards.
3) Pete can walk on his hands only one quarter the speed that Tracy can do cartwheels.
4) Pete walks on his hands at 2 miles per hour.

Now, let's solve for the speed at which Pete can walk backwards:
* If Pete walks on his hands at 2 miles per hour, and that is one quarter the speed that Tracy can do cartwheels, then Tracy can do cartwheels at 4 times that speed, which is 8 miles per hour.
* Since Tracy does cartwheels twice as fast as Susan walks forwards, then Susan walks forwards at half the speed of Tracy, which is 4 miles per hour.
* Since Pete walks backwards three times faster than Susan walks forwards, then Pete walks backwards at 3 times 4 miles per hour, which is 12 miles per hour.

Answer: 12 miles per hour.
