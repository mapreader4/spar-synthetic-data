Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cash price of the refrigerator is $8000.
2) Samantha paid a deposit of $3000.
3) She then paid 30 equal monthly installments of $300 each.
4) To calculate the total amount Samantha paid in installments, we multiply the monthly installment of $300 by the number of months, which is 30.
5) 30 x $300 = $9000
6) The total amount Samantha paid in installments is $9000.
7) To calculate how much she would have saved by paying cash, we subtract the cash price of $8000 from the total amount she paid in installments, which is $9000.
8) $9000 - $8000 = $1000

Answer: $1000
