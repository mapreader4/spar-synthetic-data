Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The laboratory has 22 beakers of liquid in the fume hood.
2) 8 of the beakers have copper ions in them.
3) Adding three drops of a solution will turn the liquid in a beaker blue if there are copper ions present.
4) The beakers are tested one by one for copper ions, and 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found.
5) To find the number of beakers without copper ions that were tested, we need to subtract the number of beakers with copper ions from the total number of beakers tested.
6) The number of beakers with copper ions is 8.
7) The total number of drops used is 45.
8) Since each beaker with copper ions requires 3 drops, the number of beakers with copper ions tested is 45 / 3 = 15.
9) Therefore, the number of beakers without copper ions that were tested is 15 - 8 = 7.
