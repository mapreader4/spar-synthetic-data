Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John wants to buy 10 pins.
2) The normal price of each pin is $20.
3) The pins are on sale for 15% off.
4) To calculate the discounted price, we take the normal price ($20) and subtract 15% of $20.
5) 15% of $20 is 0.15 * $20 = $3.
6) The discounted price per pin is $20 - $3 = $17.
7) To calculate the total cost, we multiply the discounted price per pin ($17) by the number of pins (10).
8) $17 * 10 = $170.

Answer: $170
