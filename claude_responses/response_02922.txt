Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, then she needs 6 sage leaves (12 / 2 = 6).
2) Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 6 sage leaves, then she needs 11 verbena leaves (6 + 5 = 11).
3) To find the total number of leaves, we add up the basil leaves, sage leaves, and verbena leaves:
12 basil leaves + 6 sage leaves + 11 verbena leaves = 29 leaves total.

Answer: 29
