Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Asha borrows $20 from her brother, $40 from her father, and $30 from her mother, for a total of $90 borrowed.
2) Asha is also gifted $70 from her granny.
3) Asha adds the borrowed and gifted money to her savings of $100, for a total of $90 + $70 + $100 = $260.
4) Asha then spends 3/4 of the $260 she has.
5) To calculate 3/4 of $260, we multiply $260 by 3/4, which is $195.
6) Therefore, the amount of money Asha remained with is $260 - $195 = $65.

Answer: 65
