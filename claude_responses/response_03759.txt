Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are a total of 180 bottles of drinks
* 40 of the bottles contain only cider
* 80 of the bottles contain only beer
* The remaining bottles are a mixture of cider and beer
* To find the number of mixed bottles, we subtract the number of cider-only and beer-only bottles from the total:
* 180 - 40 - 80 = 60 mixed bottles
* The delivery man gives half the number of each bottle of drink to the first house
* For the cider-only bottles, half of 40 is 20 bottles
* For the beer-only bottles, half of 80 is 40 bottles
* For the mixed bottles, half of 60 is 30 bottles
* So the first house gets:
* 20 cider bottles + 40 beer bottles + 30 mixed bottles = 90 bottles

Answer: 90
