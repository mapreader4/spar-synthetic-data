Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jordan currently has 60,000 listens on Spotify
* There are 3 months left in the year
* The number of listens per month doubles each month

So, let's calculate the number of listens for each of the remaining 3 months:
* Month 1: 60,000 listens
* Month 2: 60,000 x 2 = 120,000 listens
* Month 3: 120,000 x 2 = 240,000 listens

Now, we add up the total listens for the 3 months:
* 60,000 + 120,000 + 240,000 = 420,000 listens

Answer: 420,000
