Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James writes a 3-page letter
* He writes to 2 different friends
* He does this twice a week
* We need to find out how many pages he writes in a year

First, let's calculate how many pages he writes per week:
* 3 pages per letter x 2 friends = 6 pages per letter
* 6 pages per letter x 2 times per week = 12 pages per week

Now, let's calculate how many pages he writes in a year:
* 12 pages per week x 52 weeks in a year = 624 pages per year

Answer: 624
