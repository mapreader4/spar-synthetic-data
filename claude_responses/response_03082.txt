Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. 2 dozen is equal to 24 seashells.
2) Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, which means he found 2 x 24 = 48 seashells.
3) Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. One-third of 48 is 48 / 3 = 16 seashells.
