Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Abigail spent 60% of her money on food. This means that 40% of her initial money was left after the food purchase.
2) She then spent 25% of the remaining 40% on her phone bill. This means that 75% of the remaining 40% was left after the phone bill.
3) After spending $20 on entertainment, she is left with $40.
4) Let's call Abigail's initial money 'x'.
5) After spending 60% on food, she has 40% of x left, which is 0.4x.
6) She then spent 25% of 0.4x on her phone bill, which is 0.25 * 0.4x = 0.1x.
7) This leaves her with 0.75 * 0.4x = 0.3x.
8) After spending $20 on entertainment, she is left with $40.
9) So 0.3x - $20 = $40.
10) Solving for x, we get x = $100.

Answer: 100
