Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Last week, Evelyn's family watched 10 hours of television.
* The week before, they watched 8 hours of television.
* Next week, they will watch 12 hours of television.
* To calculate the average number of hours of television watched per week, we need to add up the total number of hours watched over the 3 weeks and divide by 3.
* Total hours watched = 10 + 8 + 12 = 30 hours
* Average hours watched per week = 30 hours / 3 weeks = 10 hours per week.
