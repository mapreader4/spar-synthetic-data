Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marnie bought 5 bags of 50 beads each. That means she has 5 * 50 = 250 beads from those bags.
2) Marnie also bought 2 bags of 100 beads each. That means she has 2 * 100 = 200 beads from those bags.
3) In total, Marnie has 250 + 200 = 450 beads.
4) Each bracelet requires 50 beads.
5) To calculate how many bracelets Marnie can make, we divide the total number of beads by the number of beads per bracelet:
450 beads / 50 beads per bracelet = 9 bracelets.

Answer: 9
