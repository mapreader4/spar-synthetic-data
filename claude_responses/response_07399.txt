Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 oranges in the fruit basket
* There are 2 fewer apples than oranges, so the number of apples is 6 - 2 = 4
* There are 3 times as many bananas as apples, so the number of bananas is 4 x 3 = 12
* There are half as many peaches as bananas, so the number of peaches is 12 / 2 = 6

Now, to find the total number of pieces of fruit in the basket, we add up the number of each type of fruit:
* 6 oranges + 4 apples + 12 bananas + 6 peaches = 28 pieces of fruit

Answer: 28
