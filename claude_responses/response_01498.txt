Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kristy's basic salary is $7.50 per hour, and she worked for 160 hours this month.
2) Her basic salary for the month is therefore: $7.50 x 160 = $1,200
3) She also earns a 16% commission on the $25,000 worth of items she sold.
4) The commission amount is: $25,000 x 0.16 = $4,000
5) Her total monthly earnings is the sum of her basic salary and commission: $1,200 + $4,000 = $5,200
6) Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings.
7) The amount for her monthly budget is: $5,200 x 0.95 = $4,940
8) The remaining amount, which is 5% of her total monthly earnings, is allocated to insurance.
9) The amount allocated to insurance is: $5,200 x 0.05 = $260

Answer: $260
