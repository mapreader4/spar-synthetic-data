Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Orlando gained 5 pounds.

2. Jose gained two pounds more than twice what Orlando gained.
   * Orlando gained 5 pounds
   * Twice of 5 pounds is 10 pounds
   * Jose gained 2 pounds more than 10 pounds, which is 12 pounds

3. Fernando gained 3 pounds less than half of what Jose gained.
   * Jose gained 12 pounds
   * Half of 12 pounds is 6 pounds
   * Fernando gained 3 pounds less than 6 pounds, which is 3 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight gained by the three family members:
* Orlando: 5 pounds
* Jose: 12 pounds
* Fernando: 3 pounds

Total weight gained = 5 + 12 + 3 = 20 pounds

Answer: 20 pounds
