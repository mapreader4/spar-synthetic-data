Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Julie bought 2 boxes of standard paper
* Each box contains 5 packages
* Each package has 250 sheets of paper
* So, the total number of sheets of paper Julie bought is:
    - 2 boxes x 5 packages per box x 250 sheets per package = 2,500 sheets of paper
* The School News uses 25 sheets of paper to print one newspaper
* To find the number of newspapers Julie can print, we divide the total number of sheets of paper by the number of sheets used per newspaper:
    - 2,500 sheets of paper / 25 sheets per newspaper = 100 newspapers

Answer: 100
