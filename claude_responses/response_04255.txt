Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jeannie hikes 12 miles to Mount Overlook at a pace of 4 miles per hour.
2) To calculate the time it takes to hike to Mount Overlook, we divide the distance by the pace:
   * Time to hike to Mount Overlook = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours
3) Jeannie then returns from Mount Overlook at a pace of 6 miles per hour.
4) To calculate the time it takes to hike back, we divide the distance by the pace:
   * Time to hike back = 12 miles / 6 miles per hour = 2 hours
5) To calculate the total time of the hike, we add the time to hike to Mount Overlook and the time to hike back:
   * Total time of the hike = 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours

Answer: 5 hours
