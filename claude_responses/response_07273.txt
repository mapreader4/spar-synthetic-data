Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total number of vehicles on the lot is 400
* Half of the vehicles on the lot are Dodge vehicles
* So, the number of Dodge vehicles is 400 / 2 = 200
* There are half as many Hyundai vehicles as there are Dodge vehicles
* So, the number of Hyundai vehicles is 200 / 2 = 100
* The remaining vehicles on the lot must be Kia vehicles
* To find the number of Kia vehicles, we subtract the number of Dodge and Hyundai vehicles from the total number of vehicles:
* 400 - 200 - 100 = 100

Answer: 100
