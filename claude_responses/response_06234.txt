Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first frog takes 4 times as many hops as the second frog
* The second frog takes twice as many hops as the third frog
* The total number of hops taken by all three frogs is 99

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of hops taken by the third frog
* Then the second frog took 2x hops
* And the first frog took 4(2x) = 8x hops

The total number of hops taken by all three frogs is 99, so we can write the equation:
8x + 2x + x = 99
11x = 99
x = 9

Therefore, the second frog took 2x = 2(9) = 18 hops to cross the road.

Answer: 18
