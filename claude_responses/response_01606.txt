Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Initially, Maya can lift 1/4 of what America can lift
* America can lift 240 pounds
* So, Maya can initially lift 240 / 4 = 60 pounds
* As Maya grows stronger, she can add 10 more pounds to what she previously could lift
* America has now hit her peak lift at 300 pounds
* When Maya reaches her absolute peak, she can lift half of what America can lift
* So, Maya's absolute peak lift is 300 / 2 = 150 pounds
* The difference between Maya's absolute peak lift and her initial lift is 150 - 60 = 90 pounds

Answer: 90 pounds
