Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Paul catches 5 fish for every 2 hours he is fishing
* We are told he was fishing for 12 hours
* To find the number of fish he caught, we need to first find how many 2-hour intervals are in 12 hours
* 12 hours / 2 hours per interval = 6 intervals
* Since Paul catches 5 fish per 2-hour interval, we can multiply 6 intervals by 5 fish per interval to get the total number of fish caught
* 6 intervals x 5 fish/interval = 30 fish

Answer: 30
