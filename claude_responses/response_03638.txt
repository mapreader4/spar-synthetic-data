Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Einstein wants to raise $500 for the school outreach program.
2) He is selling the following items:
   - Box of pizza: $12 each
   - Pack of potato fries: $0.30 each
   - Can of soda: $2 each
3) He sold:
   - 15 boxes of pizza
   - 40 packs of potato fries
   - 25 cans of soda
4) To calculate the total amount raised:
   - Pizzas: 15 x $12 = $180
   - Potato fries: 40 x $0.30 = $12
   - Soda: 25 x $2 = $50
5) Total amount raised = $180 + $12 + $50 = $242
6) The amount needed to reach the $500 goal is:
   - $500 - $242 = $258

Answer: $258
