Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tara drives for two days, stopping to fill up her gas tank each time from empty to full when she needs it.
* She visits 4 different gas stations in total.
* The prices of gas at each station are $3, $3.50, $4, and $4.50 respectively.
* Tara's car has a 12-gallon tank.

To calculate the total amount Tara spends on gas, we need to multiply the price of gas at each station by the number of gallons her car can hold (12 gallons).

* At the first station, the price of gas is $3 per gallon, so she spends 12 gallons x $3 = $36.
* At the second station, the price of gas is $3.50 per gallon, so she spends 12 gallons x $3.50 = $42.
* At the third station, the price of gas is $4 per gallon, so she spends 12 gallons x $4 = $48.
* At the fourth station, the price of gas is $4.50 per gallon, so she spends 12 gallons x $4.50 = $54.

Now, we add up the total amount spent at each station:
$36 + $42 + $48 + $54 = $180

Answer: $180
