Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 classes in the building block
* Each class uses 2 whiteboards
* Each whiteboard needs 20ml of ink per day
* Ink costs 50 cents per ml

First, we need to calculate the total amount of ink needed for all the whiteboards in a day:
* 5 classes x 2 whiteboards per class = 10 whiteboards
* 10 whiteboards x 20ml per whiteboard = 200ml of ink needed per day

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the ink:
* 200ml of ink x $0.50 per ml = $100 per day

Therefore, the cost to use the whiteboards for one day would be:
Answer: $100
