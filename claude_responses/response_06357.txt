Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The video game costs $50.
2) There is a 10% sales tax, which means the total cost of the game is $50 + (10% of $50) = $50 + $5 = $55.
3) Nina receives $10 per week as an allowance.
4) Nina can save half of her allowance each week, which is $10 / 2 = $5 per week.
5) To calculate how many weeks it will take for Nina to save up enough for the game, we divide the total cost ($55) by the amount she can save each week ($5):
55 / 5 = 11 weeks.

Answer: 11
