Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenny wants to print 7 copies of her 25-page essay
* Each page costs $0.10 to print
* So the total cost of printing the 7 copies of the 25-page essay is:
  * 7 copies x 25 pages per copy x $0.10 per page = $17.50
* Jenny also wants to buy 7 pens that each cost $1.50
* So the total cost of the 7 pens is:
  * 7 pens x $1.50 per pen = $10.50
* The total cost of the printing and the pens is:
  * $17.50 + $10.50 = $28.00
* Jenny paid with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is $40.00
* To calculate the change she should get back, we take the amount she paid ($40.00) and subtract the total cost ($28.00):
  * $40.00 - $28.00 = $12.00

Answer: $12
