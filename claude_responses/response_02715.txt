Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We have 3 people: Marcus, Humphrey, and Darrel.
2) Marcus sees 7 birds, Humphrey sees 11 birds, and Darrel sees 9 birds.
3) To find the average number of birds seen by each person, we need to add up the total number of birds seen and divide by the number of people.
4) The total number of birds seen is 7 + 11 + 9 = 27 birds.
5) There are 3 people, so we divide the total number of birds (27) by 3 to get the average.
6) 27 birds / 3 people = 9 birds per person on average.

Answer: 9
