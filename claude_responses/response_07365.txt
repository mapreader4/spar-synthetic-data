Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Frank and Bill have a total of $42.
2) They bought 3 large pizzas, each costing $11.
3) So the total cost of the 3 pizzas is 3 x $11 = $33.
4) Frank paid for all 3 pizzas, so he spent $33 of the $42.
5) The remaining money is $42 - $33 = $9.
6) Frank gave the remaining $9 to Bill.
7) Bill already had $30.
8) So the total amount of money Bill has now is $30 + $9 = $39.

Answer: 39
