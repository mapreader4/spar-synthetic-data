Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total profit made by the beadshop is $1,200
* On Monday, the shop earns one-third of the total profit
* On Tuesday, the shop earns one-quarter of the total profit
* The remaining profit is earned on Wednesday

First, let's calculate the profit made on Monday:
* One-third of $1,200 is $1,200 / 3 = $400

Next, let's calculate the profit made on Tuesday:
* One-quarter of $1,200 is $1,200 / 4 = $300

Now, we can calculate the profit made on Wednesday:
* The total profit is $1,200
* The profit made on Monday is $400
* The profit made on Tuesday is $300
* The remaining profit made on Wednesday is $1,200 - $400 - $300 = $500

Answer: $500
