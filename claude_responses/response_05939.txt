Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, 20 cans were collected.
* The number of cans increased by 5 each day.
* They collected 5 days a week to reach their goal.

To find the total number of cans collected per week, we can use the following formula:
* Total cans collected per week = (First day's cans) + (Increase per day × Number of days)
* Total cans collected per week = 20 + (5 × 5)
* Total cans collected per week = 20 + 25
* Total cans collected per week = 45

Therefore, the goal per week was 45 cans of food.

Answer: 45
