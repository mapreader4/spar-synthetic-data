Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bridgette has 2 dogs, 3 cats, and 4 birds
* She gives the dogs a bath twice a month
* She gives the cats a bath once a month
* She gives the birds a bath once every 4 months

First, let's calculate the number of baths for the dogs in a year:
* 2 dogs x 2 baths per month x 12 months = 48 dog baths

Next, let's calculate the number of baths for the cats in a year:
* 3 cats x 1 bath per month x 12 months = 36 cat baths

Finally, let's calculate the number of baths for the birds in a year:
* 4 birds x 1 bath every 4 months x 12 months / 4 = 12 bird baths

Now, we add up the total number of baths:
* 48 dog baths + 36 cat baths + 12 bird baths = 96 total baths

Answer: 96
