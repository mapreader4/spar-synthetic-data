Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Grandpa had 36 small tomatoes before going on vacation
* When he came back, he counted 100 times more tomatoes
* To find the number of tomatoes that grew in his absence, we need to subtract the original 36 tomatoes from the total number of tomatoes he counted when he returned

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes he counted when he returned:
* 36 tomatoes x 100 = 3,600 tomatoes

Now, we subtract the original 36 tomatoes to find the number of tomatoes that grew in his absence:
* 3,600 tomatoes - 36 tomatoes = 3,564 tomatoes

Answer: 3,564
