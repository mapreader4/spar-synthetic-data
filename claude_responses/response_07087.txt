Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sangita is required to fly a total of 1,500 hours to earn her pilot certificate
* She has already completed:
    - 50 hours of day flying
    - 9 hours of night flying
    - 121 hours of cross-country flying
* So the total hours she has already completed is:
    - 50 + 9 + 121 = 180 hours
* This means she still needs to complete:
    - 1,500 - 180 = 1,320 hours
* She needs to complete this in exactly 6 months
* To calculate the number of hours per month, we divide the remaining hours by the number of months:
    - 1,320 hours / 6 months = 220 hours per month

Answer: 220
