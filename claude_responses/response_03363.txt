Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joseph has socks in 4 colors: red, blue, black, and white
* He has 3 more pairs of blue socks than pairs of black socks
* He has 1 less pair of red socks than pairs of white socks
* He has twice as many blue socks as red socks
* He has a total of 6 red socks

First, let's find the number of red socks:
* Since he has 6 red socks, and each pair has 2 socks, he has 3 pairs of red socks.

Next, let's find the number of white socks:
* He has 1 less pair of red socks than pairs of white socks
* So if he has 3 pairs of red socks, he must have 4 pairs of white socks

Now, let's find the number of blue socks:
* He has twice as many blue socks as red socks
* Since he has 3 pairs of red socks, he must have 6 pairs of blue socks

Finally, let's find the number of black socks:
* He has 3 more pairs of blue socks than pairs of black socks
* Since he has 6 pairs of blue socks, he must have 3 pairs of black socks

Now we can calculate the total number of socks:
* 3 pairs of red socks = 6 red socks
* 4 pairs of white socks = 8 white socks
* 6 pairs of blue socks = 12 blue socks
* 3 pairs of black socks = 6 black socks
* Total socks = 6 + 8 + 12 + 6 = 32

Answer: 32
