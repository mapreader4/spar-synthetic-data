Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Felicity used 5 less gallons of gas than four times the number of gallons that Adhira used for her trip.
* Let's call the number of gallons Adhira used 'x'.
* Then, Felicity used 4x - 5 gallons of gas.
* Together, the girls used 30 gallons of gas.
* So, we can write the equation: x + (4x - 5) = 30
* Solving for x:
* x + 4x - 5 = 30
* 5x - 5 = 30
* 5x = 35
* x = 7
* Therefore, Adhira used 7 gallons of gas.
* Felicity used 4(7) - 5 = 23 gallons of gas.
