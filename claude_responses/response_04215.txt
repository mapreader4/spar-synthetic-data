Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John draws and colors 10 pictures
* It takes him 2 hours to draw each picture
* It takes him 30% less time to color each picture

First, let's calculate the time it takes to draw all 10 pictures:
* Time to draw 1 picture = 2 hours
* Time to draw 10 pictures = 10 * 2 hours = 20 hours

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to color all 10 pictures:
* Time to color 1 picture = 2 hours - (2 hours * 0.3) = 2 hours - 0.6 hours = 1.4 hours
* Time to color 10 pictures = 10 * 1.4 hours = 14 hours

Finally, to get the total time spent on all the pictures, we add the time to draw and the time to color:
* Total time = 20 hours + 14 hours = 34 hours

Answer: 34
