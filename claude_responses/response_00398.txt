Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The girl scouts earned a total of $30 from selling cookies.
2) It will cost $2.50 per person to go to the pool.
3) There are 10 people going to the pool.
4) To calculate the total cost of going to the pool, we multiply the cost per person ($2.50) by the number of people going (10):
   Total cost = $2.50 x 10 = $25
5) To calculate the amount left, we take the total earnings ($30) and subtract the total cost ($25):
   Amount left = $30 - $25 = $5

Answer: 5
