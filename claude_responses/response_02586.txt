Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Keanu was surfing at a speed of 20 miles per hour
* The shark was initially swimming alongside Keanu, at the same speed
* The shark then doubled its speed and moved away from Keanu
* If the shark's initial speed was the same as Keanu's, 20 miles per hour, then when the shark doubled its speed, it was now moving at 40 miles per hour
* The pilot fish was also swimming alongside Keanu and the shark
* When the shark increased its speed by 20 miles per hour (from 20 to 40), the pilot fish increased its speed by half as much, which is 10 miles per hour
* Therefore, the pilot fish was swimming at a speed of 20 miles per hour (Keanu's initial speed) plus 10 miles per hour (the increase in the pilot fish's speed)

Answer: 30 miles per hour
