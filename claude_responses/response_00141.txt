Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Larry spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog
* Half an hour is 30 minutes
* Twice a day means he spends 30 minutes x 2 = 60 minutes walking and playing with his dog
* Larry also spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog
* A fifth of an hour is 1/5 of 60 minutes, which is 12 minutes
* So in total, Larry spends 60 minutes + 12 minutes = 72 minutes on his dog each day.

Answer: 72 minutes
