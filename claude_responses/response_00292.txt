Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* May can knit 3 scarves using one yarn
* She bought 2 red yarns, 6 blue yarns, and 4 yellow yarns
* To find the total number of scarves she can make, we need to calculate the number of scarves for each color yarn and then add them together

For the red yarns:
* 2 red yarns x 3 scarves per yarn = 6 red scarves

For the blue yarns:
* 6 blue yarns x 3 scarves per yarn = 18 blue scarves

For the yellow yarns:
* 4 yellow yarns x 3 scarves per yarn = 12 yellow scarves

Now we add them all together:
* 6 red scarves + 18 blue scarves + 12 yellow scarves = 36 scarves

Answer: 36
