Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recipe on the box makes 21 pancakes
* Bobby ate 5 pancakes
* Bobby's dog ate 7 pancakes
* To find the number of pancakes Bobby has left, we need to subtract the number of pancakes eaten from the total number of pancakes made.
* Total pancakes made: 21
* Pancakes eaten by Bobby: 5
* Pancakes eaten by the dog: 7
* Pancakes left = Total pancakes made - Pancakes eaten by Bobby - Pancakes eaten by the dog
* Pancakes left = 21 - 5 - 7 = 9
