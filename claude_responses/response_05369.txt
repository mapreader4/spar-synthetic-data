Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Matt's peanut plantation is 500 feet by 500 feet, which means the total area of the plantation is 500 feet x 500 feet = 250,000 square feet.
2) 1 square foot of peanuts can make 50 grams of peanuts.
3) So the total amount of peanuts produced on the plantation is 250,000 square feet x 50 grams/square foot = 12,500,000 grams of peanuts.
4) It takes 20 grams of peanuts to make 5 grams of peanut butter.
5) So the total amount of peanut butter that can be made from 12,500,000 grams of peanuts is (12,500,000 grams / 20 grams per 5 grams of peanut butter) x 5 grams = 3,125,000 grams of peanut butter.
6) 1 kg of peanut butter sells for $10.
7) 3,125,000 grams of peanut butter is equivalent to 3,125 kg of peanut butter.
8) Therefore, the total amount of money Matt makes from his plantation is 3,125 kg x $10 per kg = $31,250.

Answer: $31,250
