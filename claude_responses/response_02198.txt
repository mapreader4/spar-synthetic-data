Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Jonas currently has:
   - 20 pairs of socks
   - 5 pairs of shoes
   - 10 pairs of pants
   - 10 t-shirts
2) The total number of individual items in his wardrobe is:
   - Socks: 20 pairs x 2 = 40 individual items
   - Shoes: 5 pairs x 2 = 10 individual items
   - Pants: 10 pairs x 2 = 20 individual items
   - T-shirts: 10 individual items
3) The total number of individual items in his current wardrobe is:
   - 40 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 80 individual items
4) To double the number of individual items in his wardrobe, he needs to have 160 individual items.
5) The number of additional socks he needs to buy is:
   - 160 - 80 = 80 individual items
6) Since each pair of socks has 2 individual items, he needs to buy 80 / 2 = 40 pairs of socks.

Answer: 40
