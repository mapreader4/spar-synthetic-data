Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We have a group of 10 students, 5 girls and 5 boys.
2) The average weight of the 5 girls is 45 kg.
3) The average weight of the 5 boys is 55 kg.
4) To find the average weight of the 10 students, we need to find the total weight of all 10 students and divide it by 10.
5) The total weight of the 5 girls is 5 * 45 kg = 225 kg.
6) The total weight of the 5 boys is 5 * 55 kg = 275 kg.
7) The total weight of all 10 students is 225 kg + 275 kg = 500 kg.
8) The average weight of the 10 students is 500 kg / 10 = 50 kg.

Answer: 50
