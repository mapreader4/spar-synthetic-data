Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bus driver drives an average of 2 hours each day, 5 days a week.
2) From Monday to Wednesday, he drove at an average speed of 12 kilometers per hour.
3) From Thursday to Friday, he drove at an average speed of 9 kilometers per hour.
4) To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to find the distance traveled each day and then add them up.
5) For Monday to Wednesday, the distance traveled each day is 2 hours * 12 kilometers per hour = 24 kilometers.
6) For Thursday and Friday, the distance traveled each day is 2 hours * 9 kilometers per hour = 18 kilometers.
7) The total distance traveled over the 5 days is:
   - Monday to Wednesday: 3 days * 24 kilometers = 72 kilometers
   - Thursday and Friday: 2 days * 18 kilometers = 36 kilometers
   - Total distance = 72 kilometers + 36 kilometers = 108 kilometers

Answer: 108 kilometers
