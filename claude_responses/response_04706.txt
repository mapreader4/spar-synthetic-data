Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips to make the dough for the cookies
* The dough makes 3 batches of cookies
* Each cookie has 9 chocolate chips
* The bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips

First, we need to find out how many cookies are made in total:
* Since each cookie has 9 chocolate chips, and the whole bag of 81 chips is used, we can divide 81 by 9 to get the total number of cookies made:
* 81 รท 9 = 9 cookies

Now, we need to find out how many cookies are in each batch:
* Since the dough makes 3 batches of cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies (9) by 3 to get the number of cookies in each batch:
* 9 รท 3 = 3 cookies per batch

Answer: 3 cookies per batch.
