Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Frank spent 1/5 of his money on groceries. This means that 4/5 of his original money was left.
2) He then spent 1/4 of the remaining money on a magazine. This means that 3/4 of the remaining money was left.
3) He had $360 left in his wallet after these two purchases.
4) Let's call the original amount of money he had as "x".
5) After buying groceries, he had 4/5 of x, which is 0.8x.
6) After buying the magazine, he had 3/4 of 0.8x, which is 0.6x.
7) We know that 0.6x = $360, so x = $600.

Answer: $600
