Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There will be a total of 15 people at the BBQ.
2) Chad needs 2 pounds of ice per person to account for the heat.
3) So the total amount of ice needed is 15 people * 2 pounds per person = 30 pounds of ice.
4) The ice is sold in 1 pound bags, with 10 bags per pack for $3.00.
5) To calculate the number of packs needed, we divide the total ice needed (30 pounds) by the amount in each pack (10 pounds):
30 pounds / 10 pounds per pack = 3 packs.
6) The cost of 3 packs at $3.00 each is:
3 packs * $3.00 per pack = $9.00.

Answer: $9
