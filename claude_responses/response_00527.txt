Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The lettuce has 30 calories
* The cucumber has 80 calories
* The 12 croutons have 20 calories each
* To calculate the total calories in the croutons, we multiply the number of croutons (12) by the calories per crouton (20):
  * 12 croutons x 20 calories/crouton = 240 calories
* To calculate the total calories in the salad, we add the calories from the lettuce, cucumber, and croutons:
  * 30 calories (lettuce) + 80 calories (cucumber) + 240 calories (croutons) = 350 calories

Answer: 350
