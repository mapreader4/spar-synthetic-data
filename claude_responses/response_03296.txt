Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kyle bikes for 2 hours to work every day.
2) The time it takes him to travel to work and back is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.
3) Ten times the time it takes him to travel to work and back is 10 * 4 hours = 40 hours.
4) The cost of buying a pack of snacks is the same as 40 hours.
5) So, if the cost of a pack of snacks is $x, then 40 hours = $x.
6) Therefore, the cost of a pack of snacks is $x = $40/40 = $1.
7) If Ryan buys 50 packs of snacks, the total cost will be 50 * $1 = $50.

Answer: $50
