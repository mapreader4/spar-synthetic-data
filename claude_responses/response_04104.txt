Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Annie's class has a total of 35 people
* Each classmate received 2 candies
* So the total number of candies given to the classmates is:
  * 35 people x 2 candies per person = 70 candies
* Annie was left with 12 candies
* So the total number of candies Annie bought is:
  * 70 candies + 12 candies = 82 candies
* Each candy costs $0.1
* So the total amount Annie spent on candies is:
  * 82 candies x $0.1 per candy = $8.2

Answer: $8.2
