Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lena has 16 candy bars.
2) Lena needs 5 more candy bars to have 3 times as many as Kevin.
3) This means that Lena needs a total of 16 + 5 = 21 candy bars to have 3 times as many as Kevin.
4) Kevin has 4 candy bars less than Nicole.
5) So if Lena has 21 candy bars and 3 times as many as Kevin, then Kevin must have 7 candy bars (21 / 3 = 7).
6) If Kevin has 7 candy bars and Nicole has 4 more, then Nicole has 11 candy bars.
7) Lena has 21 candy bars, and Nicole has 11 candy bars.
8) Therefore, Lena has 21 - 11 = 10 more candy bars than Nicole.
