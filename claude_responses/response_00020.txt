Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
2) She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is 11 + 9 = 20.
3) She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 20 - 13 = 7.
4) To find the total number of stamps Bella bought, we add up the number of each type of stamp:
   - Snowflake stamps: 11
   - Truck stamps: 20
   - Rose stamps: 7
   - Total stamps: 11 + 20 + 7 = 38

Answer: 38
