Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kira fried 3 sausages, and it takes 5 minutes to fry each sausage.
2) To find the total time to fry the 3 sausages, we multiply the number of sausages (3) by the time to fry each sausage (5 minutes):
3 sausages x 5 minutes per sausage = 15 minutes
3) Kira then scrambled 6 eggs, and it takes 4 minutes to scramble each egg.
4) To find the total time to scramble the 6 eggs, we multiply the number of eggs (6) by the time to scramble each egg (4 minutes):
6 eggs x 4 minutes per egg = 24 minutes
5) To find the total time it took Kira to make her breakfast, we add the time to fry the sausages (15 minutes) and the time to scramble the eggs (24 minutes):
15 minutes + 24 minutes = 39 minutes

Answer: 39 minutes
