Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* There are 20 stickers on each page
* You have 12 pages of stickers
* You lose one of the pages
* To calculate the total number of stickers you have, we need to:
  1. Calculate the total number of stickers on the 12 pages
  2. Subtract the number of stickers on the lost page

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stickers on the 12 pages
* Total number of stickers = 20 stickers per page x 12 pages = 240 stickers

Step 2: Subtract the number of stickers on the lost page
* Number of stickers on the lost page = 20 stickers
* Total number of stickers remaining = 240 stickers - 20 stickers = 220 stickers

Answer: 220
