Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gus eats 2 eggs for his egg-omelet breakfast
* He then has an egg salad sandwich made with 3 eggs for lunch
* Finally, he has an egg drop soup made with 1 egg for dinner
* To calculate the total number of eggs Gus ate, we add up the eggs from each meal:
* Breakfast: 2 eggs
* Lunch: 3 eggs
* Dinner: 1 egg
* Total eggs eaten: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 eggs
