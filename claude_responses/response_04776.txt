Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. This year, the number of people going to the fair is 600.
2. Next year, the number of people going to the fair will be twice as many as this year, which means it will be 600 x 2 = 1200.
3. The number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year, which means it was 1200 - 200 = 1000.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people at the fair in the three years:
This year: 600
Last year: 1000
Next year: 1200

Total number of people at the fair in the three years:
600 + 1000 + 1200 = 2800

Answer: 2800
