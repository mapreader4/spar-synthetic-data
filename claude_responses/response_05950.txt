Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.
2) Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.
3) Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces.

First, let's find out how many necklaces Rhonda caught:
* Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces
* Rhonda caught half as many as Boudreaux
* So, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces

Now, let's find out how many necklaces Latch caught:
* Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda
* Rhonda caught 6 necklaces
* So, Latch caught (3 * 6) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 necklaces

Answer: 14
