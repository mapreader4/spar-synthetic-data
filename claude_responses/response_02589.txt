Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob picked 450 apples in total
* There are 33 children in his family
* Each child ate 10 apples
* So the total number of apples eaten by the children is:
33 children x 10 apples per child = 330 apples

* Now, we need to find out how many adults are in the family
* We know that every adult ate 3 apples
* And the total number of apples picked was 450
* We can subtract the 330 apples eaten by the children from the 450 total apples to find the number of apples eaten by the adults:
450 apples - 330 apples = 120 apples

* Since each adult ate 3 apples, we can divide the 120 apples eaten by the adults by 3 to find the number of adults:
120 apples / 3 apples per adult = 40 adults

Answer: 40 adults
