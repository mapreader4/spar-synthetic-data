Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The clothing store sells 20 shirts, and each shirt costs $10
* So the total revenue from selling the shirts is:
  * 20 shirts x $10 per shirt = $200
* The clothing store also sells 10 pairs of jeans
* Each pair of jeans costs twice as much as a shirt, so each pair of jeans costs $20
* So the total revenue from selling the jeans is:
  * 10 pairs of jeans x $20 per pair = $200
* To calculate the total revenue, we add the revenue from the shirts and the jeans:
  * $200 (shirts) + $200 (jeans) = $400

Answer: 400
