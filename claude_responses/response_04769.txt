Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Corey downloaded two movie series, one with 12 seasons and the other with 14 seasons.
2) Each season in the movie series had 16 episodes.
3) Corey lost two episodes from each season for both series due to the computer's mechanical failure.

To calculate the total number of episodes remaining, we need to:
1) Calculate the total number of episodes before the mechanical failure.
2) Subtract the number of episodes lost due to the mechanical failure.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of episodes before the mechanical failure.
* Series 1 (12 seasons): 12 seasons x 16 episodes per season = 192 episodes
* Series 2 (14 seasons): 14 seasons x 16 episodes per season = 224 episodes
* Total episodes before mechanical failure: 192 + 224 = 416 episodes

Step 2: Calculate the number of episodes lost due to the mechanical failure.
* Series 1 (12 seasons): 12 seasons x 2 episodes lost per season = 24 episodes lost
* Series 2 (14 seasons): 14 seasons x 2 episodes lost per season = 28 episodes lost
* Total episodes lost: 24 + 28 = 52 episodes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of episodes remaining.
* Total episodes before mechanical failure: 416 episodes
* Total episodes lost: 52 episodes
* Total episodes remaining: 416 - 52 = 364 episodes

Answer: 364
