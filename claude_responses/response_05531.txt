Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dakota spent 3 days in the hospital
* The hospital charges $900 per day for the bed
* So for the 3 days in the hospital, the cost is:
  * 3 days x $900/day = $2,700
* The hospital also charged for two specialists to look at her for 15 minutes each
* Each specialist charges $250/hour
* 15 minutes = 0.25 hours
* So the cost for the two specialists is:
  * 2 specialists x $250/hour x 0.25 hours = $125
* Finally, the ambulance ride cost $1,800
* Adding up all the costs:
  * Hospital bed: $2,700
  * Specialists: $125
  * Ambulance ride: $1,800
  * Total: $2,700 + $125 + $1,800 = $4,625

Answer: $4,625
