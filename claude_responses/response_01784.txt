Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nancy has a bag containing 22 tortilla chips
* She gives 7 tortilla chips to her brother
* She gives 5 tortilla chips to her sister
* The remaining chips are kept by Nancy

To calculate how many chips Nancy kept for herself, we need to subtract the number of chips she gave away from the total number of chips she had:
* Chips given to brother: 7
* Chips given to sister: 5
* Total chips given away: 7 + 5 = 12
* Total chips Nancy had: 22
* Chips Nancy kept for herself: 22 - 12 = 10
