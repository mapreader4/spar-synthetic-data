Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Peanuts cost $3 per pound at Peanut Emporium.
2) There is a 15-pound minimum purchase.
3) Baxter spent $105 on peanuts.
4) To find the number of pounds Baxter purchased, we divide the total cost ($105) by the cost per pound ($3):
$105 / $3 per pound = 35 pounds
5) Since the minimum purchase is 15 pounds, the number of pounds over the minimum is:
35 pounds - 15 pounds = 20 pounds

Answer: 20
