Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 6 vans, and each van had 10 students
* So the total number of students in the vans is:
  * 6 vans x 10 students per van = 60 students
* There were 4 minibusses, and each minibus had 24 students
* So the total number of students in the minibusses is:
  * 4 minibusses x 24 students per minibus = 96 students
* To get the total number of students, we add the students in the vans and the students in the minibusses:
  * 60 students + 96 students = 156 students

Answer: 156
