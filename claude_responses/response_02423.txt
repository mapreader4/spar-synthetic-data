Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rory starts with 100 L of rainwater in his tank.
* During the heavy rainstorm, water flows into the tank at a rate of 2 L/min.
* The heavy rainstorm lasts for 90 minutes.

To calculate the total amount of water in the tank at the end of the heavy rain, we need to:
1. Calculate the amount of water that flows into the tank during the 90-minute rainstorm.
2. Add that amount to the initial 100 L of rainwater.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water that flows into the tank during the 90-minute rainstorm.
* The flow rate is 2 L/min.
* The rainstorm lasts for 90 minutes.
* Therefore, the total amount of water that flows into the tank is:
2 L/min Ã— 90 min = 180 L

Step 2: Add the amount of water that flowed into the tank to the initial 100 L of rainwater.
* Initial amount of water: 100 L
* Amount of water that flowed in: 180 L
* Total amount of water in the tank: 100 L + 180 L = 280 L

Answer: 280 L
