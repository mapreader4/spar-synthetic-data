Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The restaurant is donating $2 for every $10 donated by customers
* The average customer donates $3
* There are 40 customers that day

First, we need to calculate the total amount donated by the customers:
* Average customer donation: $3
* Number of customers: 40
* Total customer donations: $3 x 40 = $120

Now, we need to calculate the amount the restaurant will donate:
* The restaurant donates $2 for every $10 donated by customers
* Total customer donations: $120
* Restaurant donation: ($120 / $10) x $2 = $24

Therefore, the restaurant will donate $24.
