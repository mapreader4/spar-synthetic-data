Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bella is making bracelets for 6 friends
* She needs 8 beads per bracelet
* So for 6 bracelets, she needs 6 * 8 = 48 beads
* She currently has 36 beads
* To calculate how many more beads she needs, we take the total beads required (48) and subtract the beads she currently has (36)
* 48 - 36 = 12

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 12
