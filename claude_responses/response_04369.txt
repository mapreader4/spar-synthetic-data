Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The original price of the plant is $10.
* The plant has a 10% discount.
* To calculate the discounted price, we need to find 10% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.
* 10% of $10 is $1 (10% of $10 is 0.1 * $10 = $1).
* Subtracting $1 from the original price of $10 gives us $9.
