Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We are given that the sum of two numbers is 33.
2) We are also given that the second number is twice the first number.
3) Let's call the first number x.
4) Then the second number is 2x.
5) The sum of the two numbers is 33, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x = 33
6) Simplifying, we get:
3x = 33
7) Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 11
8) Since the second number is twice the first number, the second number is 2x = 2(11) = 22.

Answer: 22
