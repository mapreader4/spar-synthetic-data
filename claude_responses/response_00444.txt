Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Reggie makes 3 layups, each worth 1 point, so that's 3 points
* Reggie makes 2 free throws, each worth 2 points, so that's 4 points
* Reggie makes 1 long shot, worth 3 points
* So Reggie's total points are: 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 points
* Reggie's brother makes 4 long shots, each worth 3 points, so that's 12 points
* The difference between Reggie's points and his brother's points is: 12 - 10 = 2 points
* Therefore, Reggie loses by 2 points.
