Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tara's parents gave her $90 for her birthday
* She put the $90 in a new bank account
* The bank account gains 10% interest annually
* She doesn't withdraw the money at all

To calculate the amount she will have after a year, we need to find the total value of the account after the 10% interest is applied.

The initial amount in the account is $90.
The interest rate is 10% per year.
To calculate the interest earned, we take the initial amount ($90) and multiply it by the interest rate (10%):
* $90 x 0.10 = $9

So, the total amount in the account after one year will be the initial amount ($90) plus the interest earned ($9):
* $90 + $9 = $99

Answer: 99
