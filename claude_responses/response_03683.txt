Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 50 people at the party
* 30% of them are boys
* To find the number of boys, we take 30% of 50:
* 30% of 50 = 0.3 * 50 = 15 boys
* To find the number of girls, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of people:
* Total people - Number of boys = Number of girls
* 50 - 15 = 35 girls

Answer: 35
