Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The shirts are currently being sold for $6
* This price is 25% of the original price
* To find the original price, we need to find the value that is 4 times the current price of $6
* To do this, we can use the following equation:
* Current Price = 0.25 Ã— Original Price
* Rearranging, we get:
* Original Price = Current Price / 0.25
* Plugging in the values, we get:
* Original Price = $6 / 0.25
* Solving this, we get:
* Original Price = $24
