Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each bird eats 7 berries per day
* Samuel has 5 birds
* We want to find the total number of berries eaten by Samuel's birds in 4 days

First, let's find the total number of berries eaten by all 5 birds in 1 day:
* 5 birds x 7 berries per bird = 35 berries per day

Now, to find the total number of berries eaten in 4 days, we multiply the daily amount by 4:
* 35 berries per day x 4 days = 140 berries

Answer: 140
