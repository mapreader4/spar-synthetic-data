Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 red cars and 2 white cars available to rent
* Renting the white car costs $2 per minute
* Renting the red car costs $3 per minute
* All cars were rented for 3 hours

First, we need to calculate the total number of minutes the cars were rented:
* 3 hours = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the white cars:
* 2 white cars x 180 minutes x $2 per minute = $720

And the total earnings for the red cars:
* 3 red cars x 180 minutes x $3 per minute = $1,620

Finally, we add the earnings from the white cars and the red cars to get the total earnings:
* $720 + $1,620 = $2,340

Answer: 2340
