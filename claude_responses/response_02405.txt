Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lily types 15 words per minute
* She takes a 2-minute break every 10 minutes
* We need to find how long it takes her to type 255 words

First, let's calculate how many 10-minute intervals it takes to type 255 words:
* 255 words / 15 words per minute = 17 minutes
* 17 minutes / 10 minutes per interval = 1.7 intervals
* Since we can't have a partial interval, we'll round up to 2 intervals

Now, let's calculate the total time it takes:
* 2 intervals x 10 minutes per interval = 20 minutes of typing time
* 2 intervals x 2 minutes per break = 4 minutes of break time
* Total time = 20 minutes + 4 minutes = 24 minutes
