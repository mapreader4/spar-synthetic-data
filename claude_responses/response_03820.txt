Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes Jack 4 minutes to put his shoes on.
* It takes Jack 3 minutes longer to help each toddler with their shoes.
* There are 2 toddlers, so it takes Jack 3 minutes longer for each toddler, which is 6 minutes total.

Now, we can add up the time it takes for Jack to get ready:
* Jack's time to put on his own shoes: 4 minutes
* Time to help the 2 toddlers: 6 minutes
* Total time: 4 minutes + 6 minutes = 10 minutes

Answer: 10 minutes
