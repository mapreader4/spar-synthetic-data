Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Amara started with 100 pieces of clothing
* She donated 5 pieces to one orphanage home
* She donated triple that (3 x 5 = 15) to another orphanage home
* So the total number of clothes she donated is 5 + 15 = 20
* She then decided to throw away 15 of her old clothes
* To calculate the remaining number of clothes, we take the original 100 pieces and subtract the 20 donated and the 15 thrown away:
* 100 - 20 - 15 = 65

Answer: 65
