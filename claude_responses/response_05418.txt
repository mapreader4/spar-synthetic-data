Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that there are 480 zombies in the shopping mall currently.
2) The number of zombies is doubling every day.
3) We want to find out how many days ago there were less than 50 zombies in the mall.
4) Let's work backwards from the current number of zombies (480) to find the number of days.
5) If the number of zombies is doubling every day, then the number of zombies yesterday was 480 / 2 = 240.
6) The day before yesterday, the number of zombies was 240 / 2 = 120.
7) The day before that, the number of zombies was 120 / 2 = 60.
8) The day before that, the number of zombies was 60 / 2 = 30.
9) The day before that, the number of zombies was 30 / 2 = 15.
10) The day before that, the number of zombies was 15 / 2 = 7.5 (which is less than 50).
11) Therefore, 6 days ago, there were less than 50 zombies in the mall.
