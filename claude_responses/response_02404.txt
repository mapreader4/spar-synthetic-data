Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tommy has 3 toy cars.
2) Jessie has 3 toy cars.
3) Jessie's older brother has 5 more cars than Tommy and Jessie combined.
4) To find the total number of cars, we need to add up the cars of Tommy, Jessie, and Jessie's older brother.
5) Tommy has 3 cars and Jessie has 3 cars, so together they have 3 + 3 = 6 cars.
6) Jessie's older brother has 5 more cars than Tommy and Jessie, so he has 6 + 5 = 11 cars.
7) The total number of cars is the sum of Tommy's 3 cars, Jessie's 3 cars, and Jessie's older brother's 11 cars: 3 + 3 + 11 = 17 cars.
