Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Large boxes: 2 boxes, each using 4 feet of tape to seal + 1 foot for the address label = 5 feet per box
* Total tape for large boxes: 2 boxes x 5 feet per box = 10 feet
* Medium boxes: 8 boxes, each using 2 feet of tape to seal + 1 foot for the address label = 3 feet per box
* Total tape for medium boxes: 8 boxes x 3 feet per box = 24 feet
* Small boxes: 5 boxes, each using 1 foot of tape to seal + 1 foot for the address label = 2 feet per box
* Total tape for small boxes: 5 boxes x 2 feet per box = 10 feet
* Total tape used:
   - Large boxes: 10 feet
   - Medium boxes: 24 feet
   - Small boxes: 10 feet
* Total tape used = 10 feet + 24 feet + 10 feet = 44 feet

Answer: 44 feet
