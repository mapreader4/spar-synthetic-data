Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On a normal day, Julia can run a mile in 10 minutes
* Today, with her new uncomfortable shoes, it takes her 13 minutes to run a mile
* We want to find how much longer it would take her to run 5 miles in her new shoes compared to her old ones

First, let's calculate how long it would take her to run 5 miles in her old shoes:
* 5 miles x 10 minutes/mile = 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate how long it would take her to run 5 miles in her new shoes:
* 5 miles x 13 minutes/mile = 65 minutes

To find the difference, we subtract the time it takes in her old shoes from the time it takes in her new shoes:
* 65 minutes - 50 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it would take Julia 15 minutes longer to run 5 miles in her new shoes compared to her old ones.

Answer: 15
