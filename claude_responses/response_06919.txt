Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The total number of students in Mr. Bolton's class is 25.

2) 2/5 of the students like maths. To calculate this, we take 2/5 of 25:
2/5 * 25 = 10 students like maths.

3) The remaining students are those who do not like maths. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of students who like maths from the total number of students:
25 - 10 = 15 students do not like maths.

4) 1/3 of the remaining 15 students like science. To calculate this, we take 1/3 of 15:
1/3 * 15 = 5 students like science.

5) The rest of the students, those who do not like maths or science, like history. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of students who like maths and science from the total number of students:
25 - 10 - 5 = 10 students like history.

Therefore, the combined total number of students who like history and those who like maths is:
10 (students who like history) + 10 (students who like maths) = 20 students.

Answer: 20
