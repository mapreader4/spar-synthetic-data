Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Louie obtained 80% on the math quiz.
2) This means he got 80% of the total number of items correct.
3) He had 5 mistakes, which means he got 5 items wrong.
4) To find the total number of items on the quiz, we can use the formula:
   Total items = Items correct + Items incorrect
5) We know that Louie got 80% correct, so the number of items he got correct is 80% of the total.
6) Let's call the total number of items x.
7) Then the number of items he got correct is 0.8x.
8) And the number of items he got incorrect is 5.
9) So the equation is: 0.8x + 5 = x
10) Solving for x, we get: 0.2x = 5, so x = 25.

Answer: 25
