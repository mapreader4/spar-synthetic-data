Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 20 people bought cat food that day
* The first 8 customers bought 3 cases each
* So for the first 8 customers, the total number of cases sold is:
  * 8 customers x 3 cases each = 24 cases
* The next 4 customers bought 2 cases each
* So for the next 4 customers, the total number of cases sold is:
  * 4 customers x 2 cases each = 8 cases
* The last 8 customers bought 1 case each
* So for the last 8 customers, the total number of cases sold is:
  * 8 customers x 1 case each = 8 cases
* To get the total number of cases sold, we add up the cases sold for each group:
  * 24 cases + 8 cases + 8 cases = 40 cases

Answer: 40 cases
