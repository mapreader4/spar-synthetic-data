Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tiffany needs to re-apply sunscreen every 2 hours.
2) She will be at the beach for 16 hours.
3) So, she will need to re-apply the sunscreen 8 times (16 hours / 2 hours per application).
4) Each application requires 3 ounces of sunscreen.
5) So, she will need a total of 24 ounces of sunscreen (8 applications x 3 ounces per application).
6) Each bottle of sunscreen contains 12 ounces.
7) So, she will need to buy 2 bottles of sunscreen (24 ounces / 12 ounces per bottle).
8) Each bottle costs $3.5.
9) Therefore, the total cost of the sunscreen will be 2 bottles x $3.5 per bottle = $7.
