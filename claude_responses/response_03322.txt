Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Tony went on 5 rollercoasters, and the speeds of the first 4 were 50 mph, 62 mph, 73 mph, and 70 mph.
2) We also know that his average speed for the day was 59 mph.
3) To find the speed of the fifth coaster, we can use the formula for average speed:
Average speed = (Sum of all speeds) / (Number of coasters)
4) Rearranging this, we get:
Sum of all speeds = Average speed * Number of coasters
5) Plugging in the values we know:
Sum of all speeds = 59 mph * 5 coasters = 295 mph
6) Now we can subtract the speeds of the first 4 coasters to find the speed of the fifth coaster:
Speed of 5th coaster = 295 mph - 50 mph - 62 mph - 73 mph - 70 mph = 40 mph

Answer: 40 mph
