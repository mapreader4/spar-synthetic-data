Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys bags of popcorn for $4 each
* He sells them for $8 each
* He sells 30 bags

To calculate the profit, we need to find the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue:
* John sells 30 bags at $8 each
* Total revenue = 30 * $8 = $240

Total cost:
* John buys 30 bags at $4 each
* Total cost = 30 * $4 = $120

Profit:
* Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
* Profit = $240 - $120 = $120

Answer: $120
