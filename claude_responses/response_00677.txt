Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Caiden requires 300 feet of metal roofing for the repairs.
2) Each foot of roofing costs $8.
3) The supplier brings in 250 feet of metal roofing for free.
4) To calculate the amount of metal roofing Mr. Caiden needs to pay for, we subtract the free 250 feet from the total 300 feet required.
5) 300 feet - 250 feet = 50 feet of metal roofing that Mr. Caiden needs to pay for.
6) Since each foot of roofing costs $8, we multiply the 50 feet by $8 to get the total cost.
7) 50 feet x $8 per foot = $400.

Answer: $400.
