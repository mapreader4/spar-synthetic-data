Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ashton had two boxes of pencils.
2) Each box had 14 pencils.
3) So the total number of pencils Ashton had initially was:
   2 boxes x 14 pencils per box = 28 pencils
4) Ashton gave 6 pencils to his brother.
5) So the number of pencils Ashton had left is:
   28 pencils - 6 pencils = 22 pencils

Answer: 22
