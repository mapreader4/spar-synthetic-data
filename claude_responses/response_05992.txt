Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill's roof can bear 500 pounds of weight
* 100 leaves fall on his roof every day
* 1000 leaves weigh 1 pound

To find how many days it will take for the roof to collapse, we need to calculate how many pounds of leaves will be on the roof over time.

First, let's calculate how many pounds of leaves fall on the roof each day:
* 100 leaves per day / 1000 leaves per pound = 0.1 pounds per day

Now, we can calculate how many days it will take for the total weight of leaves to reach 500 pounds (the maximum weight the roof can bear):
* 500 pounds / 0.1 pounds per day = 5000 days

Therefore, it will take 5000 days for Bill's roof to collapse.

Answer: 5000
