Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ms. Jones got thank you cards from 30% of her class
* 1/3 of these thank you cards contained a gift card for $10
* Ms. Jones got a total of $50 in gift cards

First, let's find out how many thank you cards Ms. Jones received:
* 30% of her class sent thank you cards
* If the total amount of gift cards was $50, and each gift card was $10, then she received 5 gift cards
* Since 1/3 of the thank you cards contained a gift card, we can multiply 5 by 3 to get the total number of thank you cards received
* 5 x 3 = 15 thank you cards received

Now, we can use this information to find the total number of students in the class:
* 30% of the class sent thank you cards
* 15 thank you cards were received
* To find the total number of students, we divide 15 by 0.3 (30% expressed as a decimal)
* 15 / 0.3 = 50 students in the class

Answer: 50 students
