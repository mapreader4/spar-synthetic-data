Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marcy had 22 sodas in her fridge initially
* Tina gave her 12 plus two times the number of sodas Marcy had before
* To find the number of sodas Tina gave, we need to calculate two times the number of sodas Marcy had before, which is 2 * 22 = 44
* Then Tina gave her 12 more sodas, so the total number of sodas Tina gave is 44 + 12 = 56
* To find the total number of sodas Marcy will have for the party, we add the initial 22 sodas to the 56 sodas Tina gave:
* 22 + 56 = 78

Answer: 78
