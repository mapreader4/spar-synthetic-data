Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Claire started with 50 balloons
* She passed 1 balloon to a little girl
* 12 balloons floated away
* So after the first step, she had 50 - 1 - 12 = 37 balloons
* Over the next 30 minutes, she gave away 9 more balloons
* So now she has 37 - 9 = 28 balloons
* She then grabbed the last 11 balloons from her coworker
* So the total number of balloons Claire has is 28 + 11 = 39

Answer: 39
