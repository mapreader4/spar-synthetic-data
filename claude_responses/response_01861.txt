Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 300 animals on the street
* Two-thirds of the animals are cats
* The remaining one-third of the animals are dogs
* To find the number of dogs, we take one-third of the total animals:
* 1/3 of 300 = 100 dogs
* Dogs have 4 legs each
* So the total number of legs of the dogs on the street is:
* 100 dogs x 4 legs per dog = 400 legs

Answer: 400
