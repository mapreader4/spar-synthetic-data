Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes
* Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes
* Assuming Diego kept up the same speed, he would have taken 5 minutes to run the entire block

Now, to calculate the average time for the racers:
* Carlos took 3 minutes, which is 180 seconds
* Diego would have taken 5 minutes, which is 300 seconds
* The average time would be (180 seconds + 300 seconds) / 2 = 240 seconds

Answer: 240
