Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janet initially owns 10 action figures.
2) She sells 6 of them, so she now has 10 - 6 = 4 action figures.
3) She then buys 4 new action figures, so she now has 4 + 4 = 8 action figures.
4) Her brother then gives her his collection, which is twice the size of what Janet has at the time. 
5) At the time, Janet has 8 action figures.
6) Her brother's collection is 2 x 8 = 16 action figures.
7) So Janet now has 8 + 16 = 24 action figures in total.

Answer: 24
