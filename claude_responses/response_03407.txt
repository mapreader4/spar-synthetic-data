Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Andrew runs 2 miles per day
* Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew, so Peter runs 5 miles per day
* They run for 5 days

To calculate the total miles run by both of them:
* Andrew's total miles = 2 miles per day x 5 days = 10 miles
* Peter's total miles = 5 miles per day x 5 days = 25 miles
* Total miles run by both of them = Andrew's total + Peter's total = 10 + 25 = 35 miles

Answer: 35 miles
