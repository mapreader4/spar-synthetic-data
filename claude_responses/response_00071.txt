Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hillary sells 3 crafts at $12 per craft
* So, the total revenue from selling the 3 crafts is: 3 x $12 = $36
* Additionally, Hillary receives an extra $7 from an appreciative customer
* So, the total amount of money Hillary has before making the deposit is: $36 + $7 = $43
* Hillary then deposits $18 into her bank account
* Therefore, the amount of money Hillary is left with after making the deposit is: $43 - $18 = $25
