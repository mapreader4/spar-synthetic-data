Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* The auctioneer raises the price by $5 every time someone new bids on the item
* The price of the desk starts at $15 and goes up to $65
* The price increase is $50 (from $15 to $65)
* Since the price increases by $5 each time, we can divide the total price increase by $5 to find the number of times someone bid:
* $50 / $5 = 10
* Therefore, the desk was bid on 10 times.
* Since there are two people in a bidding war, each person must have bid 5 times.
