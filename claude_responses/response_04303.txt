Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jeffrey has 12 hens on his poultry farm.
2) For every 3 hens, there is 1 rooster. So, if there are 12 hens, there must be 4 roosters (12 hens / 3 hens per rooster = 4 roosters).
3) Each hen has 5 chicks. So, with 12 hens, there are 12 * 5 = 60 chicks.
4) In total, we have:
   - 12 hens
   - 4 roosters
   - 60 chicks
Adding these up, the total number of chickens is:
12 + 4 + 60 = 76 chickens.

Answer: 76
