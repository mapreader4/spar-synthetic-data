Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial order:
   - 1 order of eggs at $3
   - 1 order of pancakes at $2
   - 2 mugs of cocoa at $2 each, so 2 x $2 = $4
   - Total for initial order: $3 + $2 + $4 = $9

2. Tax for initial order:
   - Tax is $1

3. Total for initial order including tax:
   - $9 + $1 = $10

4. Ben's additional order:
   - 1 more order of pancakes at $2
   - 1 more mug of cocoa at $2
   - Total for additional order: $2 + $2 = $4

5. Total for the entire order:
   - Initial order: $10
   - Additional order: $4
   - Total: $10 + $4 = $14

6. Amount paid:
   - They paid $15

7. Change they should get:
   - $15 - $14 = $1

Answer: $1
