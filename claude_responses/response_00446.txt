Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 10 children in the classroom.
2) Each child has 7 books.
3) To find the total number of books the children have, we multiply the number of children (10) by the number of books each child has (7):
10 children x 7 books per child = 70 books
4) The teacher brings an additional 8 books to the classroom.
5) To find the total number of books in the classroom, we add the number of books the children have (70) to the number of books the teacher brings (8):
70 books + 8 books = 78 books

Answer: 78
