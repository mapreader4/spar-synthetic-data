Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carol gets a fixed $20 allowance each week
* She can earn $1.5 more per week if she does extra chores
* At the end of 10 weeks, she has $425 total

To find the number of extra chores she averaged each week, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount she would have earned from her fixed $20 allowance over 10 weeks:
   * $20 per week x 10 weeks = $200
2. Subtract the fixed allowance from the total amount she has ($425):
   * $425 - $200 = $225
3. This remaining $225 is the amount she earned from extra chores over the 10 weeks.
4. To find the average number of extra chores per week, we divide the total extra earnings by the extra earnings per week:
   * $225 / ($1.5 per week) = 150 extra chores over 10 weeks
5. To find the average per week, we divide the total extra chores by the number of weeks:
   * 150 extra chores / 10 weeks = 15 extra chores per week on average

Answer: 15
