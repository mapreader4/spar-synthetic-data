Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On Monday, Mack writes in his journal for 60 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 30 minutes. 
* So, in 60 minutes, he will write 2 pages (60 minutes / 30 minutes per page = 2 pages).

On Tuesday, Mack writes in his journal for 45 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 15 minutes.
* So, in 45 minutes, he will write 3 pages (45 minutes / 15 minutes per page = 3 pages).

On Wednesday, Mack writes 5 pages in his journal.

Now, to calculate the total number of pages Mack writes in his journal from Monday to Wednesday:
* Monday: 2 pages
* Tuesday: 3 pages
* Wednesday: 5 pages
* Total: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 pages

Answer: 10
