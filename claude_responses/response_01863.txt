Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Edmonton is 220 kilometers north of Red Deer.
2) Calgary is 110 kilometers south of Red Deer.
3) The total distance from Edmonton to Calgary is the sum of the distances from Edmonton to Red Deer and from Red Deer to Calgary.
4) The distance from Edmonton to Red Deer is 220 kilometers.
5) The distance from Red Deer to Calgary is 110 kilometers.
