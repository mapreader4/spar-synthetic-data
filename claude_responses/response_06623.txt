Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Farmer Steven's tractor can scoop up 75 pounds of compost per minute
* Darrel can scoop up 10 pounds of compost per minute
* Together, they can scoop up 75 + 10 = 85 pounds of compost per minute
* The total amount of compost they need to load is 2550 pounds
* To find the time it would take them to load 2550 pounds, we divide the total amount by the combined rate:
* 2550 pounds / 85 pounds per minute = 30 minutes

Answer: 30 minutes
