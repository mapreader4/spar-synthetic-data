Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yanna bought 10 shirts at $5 each
* So the total cost of the shirts is 10 x $5 = $50
* Yanna also bought 3 pairs of sandals at $3 each
* So the total cost of the sandals is 3 x $3 = $9
* The total cost of the shirts and sandals is $50 + $9 = $59
* Yanna paid with a one hundred dollar bill
* To calculate the change, we take the one hundred dollar bill and subtract the total cost of $59
* $100 - $59 = $41
* Answer: $41
