Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The pool currently has 48 blue tiles and 32 red tiles.
2) The total number of tiles currently in the pool is 48 + 32 = 80 tiles.
3) The pool needs 100 tiles to be completed.
4) To find the number of additional tiles needed, we subtract the current number of tiles (80) from the total number of tiles needed (100).
5) 100 - 80 = 20 tiles.

Answer: 20
