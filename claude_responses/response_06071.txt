Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pizza has 8 slices
* Each slice is 300 calories
* Bob eats half of the pizza

To calculate the total calories Bob ate, we need to:
1. Calculate the total calories in the entire pizza:
   * 8 slices x 300 calories per slice = 2,400 total calories in the pizza
2. Calculate how many slices Bob ate:
   * Bob ate half of the pizza, so he ate 4 slices (half of 8 slices)
3. Calculate the total calories Bob ate:
   * 4 slices x 300 calories per slice = 1,200 calories

Answer: 1,200
