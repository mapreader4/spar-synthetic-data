Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rachel earned $200 babysitting.
2) She spent 1/4 of the $200 on lunch.
   - 1/4 of $200 is $50.
   - So she spent $50 on lunch.
3) She spent 1/2 of the $200 on a DVD.
   - 1/2 of $200 is $100.
   - So she spent $100 on the DVD.
4) To calculate how much she had left, we take the original $200 and subtract the amounts she spent:
   - $200 - $50 (lunch) - $100 (DVD) = $50 left.

Answer: 50
