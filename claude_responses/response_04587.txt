Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* For the first 5 days, Chantel makes 2 bracelets per day
* So for the first 5 days, she makes a total of 2 x 5 = 10 bracelets
* She then gives away 3 bracelets to her friends at school
* So after the first 5 days, she has 10 - 3 = 7 bracelets
* For the next 4 days, she makes 3 bracelets per day
* So for the next 4 days, she makes a total of 3 x 4 = 12 bracelets
* She then gives away 6 bracelets to her friends at soccer practice
* So after the 4 days, she has 7 + 12 - 6 = 13 bracelets
