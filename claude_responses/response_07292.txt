Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Marta bought 5 textbooks on sale for $10 each.
   * Cost of 5 textbooks on sale = 5 x $10 = $50

2. Marta ordered 2 textbooks online for a total of $40.
   * Cost of 2 textbooks ordered online = $40

3. Marta bought 3 textbooks directly from the bookstore for a total of three times the cost of the online ordered books.
   * Cost of 3 textbooks from the bookstore = 3 x $40 = $120

4. To calculate the total amount Marta spent on textbooks, we add up the costs from steps 1, 2, and 3:
   * Total cost = $50 + $40 + $120 = $210

Answer: $210
