Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The original pizza has 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni.
2) Lard cuts the whole, uncut pizza in half, so now there are 2 halves, each with 20 slices of pepperoni.
3) Lard then cuts these 2 halves in half, so now there are 4 quarters, each with 10 slices of pepperoni.
4) Lard gives one of these quarters to Jelly.
5) However, 1 slice of pepperoni falls off the slice when Lard picks it up, so the slice Jelly receives has 9 slices of pepperoni.

Answer: 9
