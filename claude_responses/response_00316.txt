Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original selling price of the bicycle was $220.
2) The price was increased by 15%.
3) To calculate the new price, we need to find 15% of the original price and add it to the original price.
4) 15% of $220 is 0.15 x $220 = $33.
5) Adding the $33 increase to the original $220 price, we get $220 + $33 = $253.
