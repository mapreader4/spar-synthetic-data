Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are told that there are 78 pieces of fruit in the crate.
2) One-third of the box contains kiwi. To find the number of kiwi, we take one-third of the total pieces of fruit:
   * 1/3 of 78 = 78 / 3 = 26 kiwi
3) The rest of the pieces of fruit are strawberries. To find the number of strawberries, we subtract the number of kiwi from the total number of pieces of fruit:
   * 78 - 26 = 52 strawberries

Answer: 52
