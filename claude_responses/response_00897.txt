Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side.
2) The perimeter of the square-shaped paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen.
3) The side length of the square-shaped paper is 20 cm.
4) So the perimeter of the square-shaped paper is 4 * 20 cm = 80 cm.
5) The perimeter of the square-shaped paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen.
6) Therefore, the height of the computer screen is 80 cm + 20 cm = 100 cm.

Answer: 100 cm
