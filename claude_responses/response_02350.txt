Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The maximum number of apps Roger can have on his phone for optimal function is 50.
2) The recommended number of apps is 35.
3) Roger has twice the recommended number of apps, which means he has 2 * 35 = 70 apps.
4) To function optimally again, Roger must delete the number of apps that exceeds the maximum of 50.
5) The number of apps he must delete is 70 - 50 = 20.

Answer: 20
