Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Daria has already collected $20 in her piggy bank.
2) She plans to add $10 to the piggy bank each week.
3) The vacuum cleaner costs $120.
4) To calculate how many weeks it will take her to raise enough money, we need to find how much more money she needs to save.
5) The total amount she needs to save is $120 - $20 = $100.
6) Since she adds $10 each week, we can divide the remaining amount ($100) by the weekly contribution ($10) to find the number of weeks.
7) $100 / $10 = 10 weeks.

Answer: 10 weeks.
