Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Anna has a certain number of phone chargers
* She has five times more laptop chargers than phone chargers
* She has a total of 24 chargers

Let's call the number of phone chargers 'x'.
* Then the number of laptop chargers is 5x.
* The total number of chargers is x + 5x = 6x.
* We are told the total number of chargers is 24.
* So 6x = 24
* Solving for x, we get x = 4

Therefore, Anna has 4 phone chargers.
