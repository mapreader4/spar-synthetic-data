Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Half of the marbles are blue
* A quarter of the marbles are red
* 27 of the marbles are green
* 14 of the marbles are yellow

To find the total number of marbles, we need to add up the number of marbles of each color.

First, let's find the number of blue marbles:
* If half of the marbles are blue, and we don't know the total number of marbles yet, let's call the total number of marbles "x"
* Half of x is x/2, so the number of blue marbles is x/2

Next, let's find the number of red marbles:
* A quarter of the marbles are red, so the number of red marbles is x/4

We know the number of green marbles is 27, and the number of yellow marbles is 14.

So the total number of marbles is the sum of the blue, red, green, and yellow marbles:
* x/2 + x/4 + 27 + 14 = x

Solving this equation:
* x/2 + x/4 + 41 = x
* 3x/4 + 41 = x
* 3x = 4x - 164
* x = 164

Therefore, the total number of marbles in the jar is 164.

Answer: 164
