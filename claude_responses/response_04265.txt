Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emerie has 6 quarters, 7 dimes, and 5 nickels
* Zain has 10 more of each coin than Emerie
* To find the number of coins Zain has, we need to add 10 to each of Emerie's coin amounts

For the quarters:
* Emerie has 6 quarters
* Zain has 10 more, so Zain has 6 + 10 = 16 quarters

For the dimes:
* Emerie has 7 dimes
* Zain has 10 more, so Zain has 7 + 10 = 17 dimes

For the nickels:
* Emerie has 5 nickels
* Zain has 10 more, so Zain has 5 + 10 = 15 nickels

Adding up all of Zain's coins:
* 16 quarters + 17 dimes + 15 nickels = 48 coins

Answer: 48
