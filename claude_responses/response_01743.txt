Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wayne plans on 5 shrimp per guest
2) He will have 40 guests
3) So the total number of shrimp needed is 5 shrimp per guest x 40 guests = 200 shrimp
4) Each pound of shrimp has 20 shrimp
5) Therefore, the total number of pounds of shrimp needed is 200 shrimp / 20 shrimp per pound = 10 pounds
6) The shrimp costs $17.00 per pound
7) So the total cost for the shrimp will be 10 pounds x $17.00 per pound = $170.00

Answer: $170
