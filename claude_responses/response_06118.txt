Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A single train car can carry 60 passengers
* A 747 airplane can carry 366 passengers
* We are comparing the capacity of a train with 16 cars to the capacity of 2 airplanes

First, let's calculate the capacity of the train with 16 cars:
* 16 cars x 60 passengers per car = 960 passengers

Next, let's calculate the capacity of 2 airplanes:
* 2 airplanes x 366 passengers per airplane = 732 passengers

Now, we can find the difference in capacity between the train and the 2 airplanes:
* 960 passengers (train) - 732 passengers (2 airplanes) = 228 passengers

Answer: 228
