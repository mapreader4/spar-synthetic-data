Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The living room set consists of a sofa worth $1,250, 2 armchairs costing $425 each, and a coffee table.
2) The total amount of the invoice is $2,430.
3) To find the price of the coffee table, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total invoice amount.
4) The cost of the sofa is $1,250.
5) The cost of the 2 armchairs is 2 * $425 = $850.
6) The total cost of the sofa and armchairs is $1,250 + $850 = $2,100.
7) To find the price of the coffee table, we subtract the cost of the sofa and armchairs from the total invoice amount:
$2,430 - $2,100 = $330.

Answer: $330
