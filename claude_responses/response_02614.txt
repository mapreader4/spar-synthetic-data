Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Megan originally bought a dozen eggs (12 eggs)
* Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs (12 more eggs)
* So Megan now has a total of 24 eggs (12 + 12)
* Megan used 2 eggs for an omelet and 4 eggs for a cake, so she used 6 eggs in total
* That leaves Megan with 24 - 6 = 18 eggs remaining
* Megan gave her aunt half of the remaining 18 eggs, which is 9 eggs
* That leaves Megan with 18 - 9 = 9 eggs remaining
* Megan plans to divide the remaining 9 eggs equally for her next 3 meals
* To calculate how many eggs per meal, we divide 9 by 3:

Answer: 3 eggs per meal
