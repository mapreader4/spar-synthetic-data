Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there are:
  - 2 cows
  - 3 pigs
  - 6 goats
* The farmer plans to add:
  - 3 cows
  - 5 pigs
  - 2 goats
* To find the total number of animals on the farm, we need to add the initial number of animals and the additional animals:
  - Cows: 2 + 3 = 5
  - Pigs: 3 + 5 = 8
  - Goats: 6 + 2 = 8
* Adding up all the animals, the total number of animals on the farm will be:
  - 5 cows + 8 pigs + 8 goats = 21 animals

Answer: 21
