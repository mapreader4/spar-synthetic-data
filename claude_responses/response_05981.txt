Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cortney's internet speed is 2 megabits per minute
* She is downloading 3 files with sizes of 80 megabits, 90 megabits, and 70 megabits
* To calculate the total time it will take to download all the files, we need to find the time for each file and then add them together.

For the first file (80 megabits):
* Time to download = 80 megabits / 2 megabits per minute = 40 minutes

For the second file (90 megabits):
* Time to download = 90 megabits / 2 megabits per minute = 45 minutes 

For the third file (70 megabits):
* Time to download = 70 megabits / 2 megabits per minute = 35 minutes

Now, we add up the time for all 3 files:
* Total time = 40 minutes + 45 minutes + 35 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
* Total time in hours = 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
