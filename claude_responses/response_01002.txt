Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has.
   - Let's call the amount of money Jethro has as "x".
   - Carmen needs 2x - $7 to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has.
2) Patricia has $60, which is 3 times as much as Jethro.
   - So, Jethro has $60 / 3 = $20.
3) Now we can calculate the sum of all their money:
   - Jethro has $20.
   - Carmen needs 2 * $20 - $7 = $33.
   - Patricia has $60.
   - The sum of all their money is $20 + $33 + $60 = $113.

Answer: 113
