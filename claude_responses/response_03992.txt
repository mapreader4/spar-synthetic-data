Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hooper Bay has twice as many pounds of lobster than the two other harbors combined
* The other two harbors have 80 pounds of lobster each
* To find the total pounds of lobster the three harbors are holding, we need to:
1. Find the total pounds of lobster in the two other harbors
2. Multiply that total by 2 to get the pounds of lobster in Hooper Bay
3. Add the pounds of lobster in the two other harbors and Hooper Bay

Step 1: Find the total pounds of lobster in the two other harbors
* Each harbor has 80 pounds
* 80 + 80 = 160 pounds

Step 2: Multiply the total pounds in the two other harbors by 2 to get the pounds in Hooper Bay
* 160 x 2 = 320 pounds

Step 3: Add the pounds of lobster in the two other harbors and Hooper Bay
* 160 + 320 = 480 pounds

Answer: 480 pounds
