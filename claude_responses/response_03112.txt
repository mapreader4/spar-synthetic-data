Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The third school had 200 students
* The second school had 40 more students than the third school
* So the second school had 200 + 40 = 240 students
* The first school had twice as many students as the second school
* So the first school had 2 * 240 = 480 students
* The total number of students is the sum of the students from the three schools:
* 200 + 240 + 480 = 920 students
* After the debate, every student shook the mayor's hand
* Therefore, the total number of students who shook the mayor's hand on the stage is:
Answer: 920
