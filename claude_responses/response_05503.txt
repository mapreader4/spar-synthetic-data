Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In the morning, Yanna baked 20 butter cookies and 40 biscuits.
2) In the afternoon, Yanna baked 10 more butter cookies and 20 more biscuits.
3) To find the total number of butter cookies baked, we add the morning and afternoon batches:
   20 + 10 = 30 butter cookies
4) To find the total number of biscuits baked, we add the morning and afternoon batches:
   40 + 20 = 60 biscuits
5) To find the difference between the number of biscuits and butter cookies baked, we subtract the number of butter cookies from the number of biscuits:
   60 - 30 = 30

Answer: 30
