Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joan has 2 hours (120 minutes) to complete all her music practice
* She spends 30 minutes on the piano
* She spends 25 minutes writing music on her computer
* She spends 38 minutes reading about the history of the piano
* Now, let's add up the time she has spent so far:
  - 30 minutes on the piano
  - 25 minutes writing music
  - 38 minutes reading about the piano history
  - Total time spent: 30 + 25 + 38 = 93 minutes
* Now, we can subtract the time she has spent from the total time she has (120 minutes):
  - 120 minutes - 93 minutes = 27 minutes
* Therefore, Joan has 27 minutes left to use the special finger exerciser.

Answer: 27
