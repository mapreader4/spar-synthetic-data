Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog.
2) In 6 years, Tom's brother will be 30 years old.
3) This means that currently, Tom's brother is 30 - 6 = 24 years old.
4) Since Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog, we can divide Tom's brother's current age by 4 to get the current age of Tom's dog:
   * Tom's dog's current age = 24 / 4 = 6 years old.
5) In 6 years, Tom's dog will be 6 + 6 = 12 years old.

Answer: 12
