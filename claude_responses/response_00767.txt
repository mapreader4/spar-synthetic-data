Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 40 kids on Lake Pleasant.
2) A fourth of the kids went tubing. To find the number of kids who went tubing, we take 1/4 of 40, which is 10 kids.
3) Half of the tubers went rafting. So, of the 10 kids who went tubing, half of them, or 5 kids, went rafting.
4) The question asks how many of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion. Since all 5 kids who went rafting also went tubing, the answer is 5.

Answer: 5
