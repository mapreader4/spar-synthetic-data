Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* James's favorite basketball player gets paid $10,000 if he averages 30 or more points a game, and $8,000 if he averages under 30 points a game.
* In the first game, he scored 30 points.
* In the second game, he scored 28 points.
* In the third game, he scored 32 points.
* In the fourth game, he scored 34 points.
* In the fifth game, he scored 26 points.
* To calculate the total points scored in the week, we add up the points from each game:
30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26 = 150 points
* To calculate the average points per game, we divide the total points by the number of games played:
150 points / 5 games = 30 points per game
* Since the player averaged 30 or more points per game, he gets paid $10,000 for the week.

Answer: 10,000
