Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marcel buys 10 ears of corn
* Dale buys half the amount of corn that Marcel buys, which is 5 ears of corn
* Dale buys 8 potatoes
* Marcel also buys some potatoes, but the total number of vegetables they buy is 27

To find the number of potatoes Marcel bought, we need to subtract the number of corn from the total number of vegetables, and then subtract the number of potatoes Dale bought.

The total number of corn is 10 + 5 = 15
The total number of potatoes is 8 + the number of potatoes Marcel bought
The total number of vegetables is 27

So, the number of potatoes Marcel bought is:
27 (total vegetables) - 15 (total corn) - 8 (potatoes Dale bought) = 4 potatoes
