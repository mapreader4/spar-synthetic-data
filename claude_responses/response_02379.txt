Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each pig needs 3 gallons of water
* There are 8 pigs, so the total water needed for the pigs is:
  * 8 pigs x 3 gallons per pig = 24 gallons
* Each horse needs twice as much water as a pig, so each horse needs 6 gallons of water (2 x 3 gallons)
* There are 10 horses, so the total water needed for the horses is:
  * 10 horses x 6 gallons per horse = 60 gallons
* The chickens need 30 gallons of water from one tank
* To find the total water needed, we add up the water needed for the pigs, horses, and chickens:
  * 24 gallons + 60 gallons + 30 gallons = 114 gallons

Answer: 114 gallons
