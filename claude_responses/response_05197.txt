Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Billy rode his bike 17 times
* John rode his bike twice as many times as Billy
* To find how many times John rode his bike, we multiply Billy's rides by 2:
  * 17 x 2 = 34 times
* Their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John
* To find how many times their mother rode her bike, we multiply John's rides by 10:
  * 34 x 10 = 340 times
* To find the total number of times they rode their bikes, we add up the rides of Billy, John, and their mother:
  * 17 + 34 + 340 = 391 times

Answer: 391
