Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Kate saved $27 in March, $13 in April, and $28 in May.
2) The total amount Kate saved is $27 + $13 + $28 = $68.
3) Kate then spent $49 on a keyboard and $5 on a mouse, for a total of $54 spent.
4) To find the amount of money Kate has left, we take the total amount she saved ($68) and subtract the total amount she spent ($54).
5) $68 - $54 = $14.
