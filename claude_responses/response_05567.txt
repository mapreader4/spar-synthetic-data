Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 8000 jelly beans in the barrel
* 10 people lined up to take some
* The first 6 people each took twice as many jelly beans as each of the last 4 people
* The last 4 people each took 400 jelly beans

First, let's calculate how many jelly beans the last 4 people took:
* 4 people x 400 jelly beans each = 1600 jelly beans

Now, let's calculate how many jelly beans the first 6 people took:
* Since the first 6 people each took twice as many as the last 4 people, that means each of the first 6 people took 800 jelly beans (2 x 400)
* 6 people x 800 jelly beans each = 4800 jelly beans

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans taken:
* 1600 jelly beans (last 4 people) + 4800 jelly beans (first 6 people) = 6400 jelly beans

Finally, we can calculate the number of jelly beans remaining in the container:
* 8000 jelly beans (original amount) - 6400 jelly beans (taken) = 1600 jelly beans

Answer: 1600
