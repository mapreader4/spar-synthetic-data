Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In 5 years, Heath will be 3 times as old as Jude.
2) This means that if Heath is x years old in 5 years, then Jude will be x/3 years old in 5 years.
3) We know that Heath is 16 years old today.
4) In 5 years, Heath will be 16 + 5 = 21 years old.
5) So, x = 21.
6) If Jude is x/3 years old in 5 years, then Jude will be (21/3) = 7 years old in 5 years.
7) Therefore, Jude is 7 - 5 = 2 years old today.
