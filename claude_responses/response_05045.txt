Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Last week, Mr. Sanchez bought 6 feet of rope
* This week, he bought 4 feet less than last week
* So, this week he bought 6 feet - 4 feet = 2 feet of rope
* In total, he bought 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet of rope
* We know that there are 12 inches in a foot
* So, 8 feet of rope is equivalent to 8 * 12 = 96 inches of rope

Answer: 96
