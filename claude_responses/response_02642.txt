Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* George had $100 to start with.
* He bought a shirt for $24.
* He also bought a pair of socks.
* After these purchases, he had $65 left.

To find the cost of the pair of socks, we can use the following equation:
* Initial amount - Cost of shirt - Cost of socks = Amount left
* $100 - $24 - Cost of socks = $65

Rearranging the equation to solve for the cost of the socks:
* Cost of socks = $100 - $24 - $65
* Cost of socks = $11

Answer: $11
