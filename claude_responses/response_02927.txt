Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The shoe company sells $4000 worth of shoes every month
* They want to make $60000 in an entire year
* To calculate how much more they need to make per month, we need to:
    1. Calculate the total amount they make in a year at the current rate of $4000 per month
    2. Subtract that amount from the desired $60000 to get the additional amount needed
    3. Divide the additional amount needed by the number of months in a year to get the additional amount needed per month

Step 1: Calculate the total amount they make in a year at the current rate of $4000 per month
* $4000 per month x 12 months = $48000 per year

Step 2: Subtract the current yearly amount from the desired $60000 to get the additional amount needed
* $60000 - $48000 = $12000 additional needed

Step 3: Divide the additional $12000 by 12 months to get the additional amount needed per month
* $12000 / 12 months = $1000 additional per month

Answer: $1000
