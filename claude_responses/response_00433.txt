Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael charges $100 for a large painting
* He sold 5 large paintings
* So, the total revenue from large paintings is:
  * 5 large paintings x $100 per painting = $500
* Michael charges $80 for a small painting
* He sold 8 small paintings
* So, the total revenue from small paintings is:
  * 8 small paintings x $80 per painting = $640
* To calculate the total amount he earned, we add the revenue from large paintings and small paintings:
  * $500 + $640 = $1,140

Answer: $1,140
