Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The school has 100 students total.
2. Half of the students are girls, and half are boys.
   * So, there are 50 girls and 50 boys.
3. 20% of the girls have dogs at home.
   * 20% of 50 girls = 0.20 * 50 = 10 girls have dogs.
4. 10% of the boys have dogs at home.
   * 10% of 50 boys = 0.10 * 50 = 5 boys have dogs.
5. To find the total number of students who own dogs, we add the number of girls with dogs and the number of boys with dogs:
   * 10 girls + 5 boys = 15 students own dogs.

Answer: 15
