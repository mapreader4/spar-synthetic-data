Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Hubert's order:
* 8 boxes of pizza at $14 each
* 10 cans of soda at $1.80 each
* Total for Hubert's order = (8 x $14) + (10 x $1.80) = $112 + $18 = $130

Ian's order:
* 10 boxes of pizza at $14 each
* 15 cans of soda at $1.80 each
* Total for Ian's order = (10 x $14) + (15 x $1.80) = $140 + $27 = $167

Total spent by both Hubert and Ian:
* Total spent = Hubert's order + Ian's order
* Total spent = $130 + $167 = $297

Answer: $297
