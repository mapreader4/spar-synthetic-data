Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Dor√© bought:
    - $140 worth of pants
    - $43 shirt
    - $15 tie
* So the total amount he spent is:
    - $140 + $43 + $15 = $198
* He paid with a $200 bill
* To calculate the amount he will get back, we take the amount he paid ($200) and subtract the total amount he spent ($198)
* $200 - $198 = $2
