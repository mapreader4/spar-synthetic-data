Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, Anna had 37 stamps in her collection.
2) Alison had 28 stamps in her collection.
3) Alison gave Anna half of her collection, which is 28 / 2 = 14 stamps.
4) So after this exchange, Anna had 37 + 14 = 51 stamps.
5) Anna then traded Jeff two bluebird stamps for one mountain stamp.
6) So Anna lost 2 stamps in this trade, leaving her with 51 - 2 = 49 stamps.

Answer: 49
