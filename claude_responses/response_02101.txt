Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Brenda and her 9 friends want to order a pizza, so there are 10 people total.
2) Each person will eat 2 slices of pizza.
3) So the total number of slices needed is 10 people x 2 slices per person = 20 slices.
4) Each pizza has 4 slices.
5) To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices needed (20) by the number of slices per pizza (4).
6) 20 slices / 4 slices per pizza = 5 pizzas.
