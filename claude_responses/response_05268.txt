Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pat's Pool Supply has three times as many swimming pools as Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store.
2) Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store has 200 pools.
3) To find the number of pools at Pat's Pool Supply, we multiply the number of pools at Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store by 3:
   * 200 pools x 3 = 600 pools

Therefore, the total number of pools between the two stores is:
* 200 pools (at Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store) + 600 pools (at Pat's Pool Supply) = 800 pools

Answer: 800
