Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Initially, Mark plants some number of strawberry plants
* Every month, the number of strawberry plants doubles
* After 3 months, Mark digs up 4 strawberry plants and gives them to his friend
* After this, Mark still has 20 strawberry plants

Let's start by finding the number of strawberry plants after 3 months, before Mark digs up 4 of them.
* If the initial number of plants is x, then after 1 month, the number of plants is 2x
* After 2 months, the number of plants is 2(2x) = 4x
* After 3 months, the number of plants is 2(4x) = 8x

Now, Mark digs up 4 plants, so the number of plants he has left is 8x - 4.
We know that this is 20, so we can set up an equation:
* 8x - 4 = 20
* 8x = 24
* x = 3

Therefore, Mark initially planted 3 strawberry plants.
