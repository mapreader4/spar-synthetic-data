Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony starts with 2 fish
* Every year, his parents buy him 2 more fish
* But one of the fish dies each year
* So, in the first year, he will have:
  - 2 (original fish) + 2 (new fish) - 1 (died) = 3 fish
* In the second year, he will have:
  - 3 (previous year) + 2 (new fish) - 1 (died) = 4 fish
* In the third year, he will have:
  - 4 (previous year) + 2 (new fish) - 1 (died) = 5 fish
* In the fourth year, he will have:
  - 5 (previous year) + 2 (new fish) - 1 (died) = 6 fish
* In the fifth year, he will have:
  - 6 (previous year) + 2 (new fish) - 1 (died) = 7 fish

Answer: 7 fish
