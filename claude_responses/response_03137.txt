Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 10 students in the class
* 5 students scored a 92 on the test
* 4 students scored an 80 on the test
* The teacher would be happy if the class average test score was at least 85

To find the score the last student needs to get, we need to calculate the total score of the class and then divide it by 10 to get the average.

The total score of the class is:
* 5 students x 92 = 460
* 4 students x 80 = 320
* Total = 460 + 320 = 780

Now, we need to find the score the last student needs to get to make the average at least 85.
* Total score needed for average of 85 = 10 x 85 = 850
* Score needed for last student = 850 - 780 = 70

Therefore, the last student would need to score a 70 on the test to at least make the teacher happy.

Answer: 70
