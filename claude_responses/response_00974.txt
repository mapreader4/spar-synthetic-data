Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Jessie invited 4 friends over to play.
2) They made a total of 20 muffins.
3) Jessie wants to divide the muffins equally between herself and her 4 friends.
4) To find the number of muffins each person will have, we need to divide the total number of muffins (20) by the total number of people (5, including Jessie).
5) 20 muffins / 5 people = 4 muffins per person.
