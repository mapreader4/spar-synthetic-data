Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shelby and her mom made a dozen (12) bags of buttered popcorn
* They also made 10 bags of caramel popcorn
* In total, they made 12 + 10 = 22 bags of popcorn
* Shelby's brother Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 bag of caramel popcorn
* So, the total number of bags of popcorn taken by Alan is 3 + 1 = 4 bags
* To find the number of bags of popcorn Shelby has left for the party, we need to subtract the number of bags taken by Alan from the total number of bags made:
* 22 bags - 4 bags taken by Alan = 18 bags of popcorn left for the party
