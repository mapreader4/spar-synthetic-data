Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats.
2. Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy, so Ben has 7 + 9 = 16 dogs.
3. Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy, so Dave has 8 + 13 = 21 cats.
4. Dave has 5 less dogs than Teddy, so Dave has 7 - 5 = 2 dogs.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets:
Teddy: 7 dogs + 8 cats = 15 pets
Ben: 16 dogs
Dave: 2 dogs + 21 cats = 23 pets

Total pets = 15 + 16 + 23 = 54

Answer: 54
