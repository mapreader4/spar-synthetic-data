Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Thursday, the Meat Market sold 210kg of ground beef.
* On Friday, they sold twice the amount they sold on Thursday, which is 2 x 210kg = 420kg.
* On Saturday, they sold 130kg.
* On Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, which is 0.5 x 130kg = 65kg.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of meat they sold:
* Thursday: 210kg
* Friday: 420kg
* Saturday: 130kg
* Sunday: 65kg
* Total: 210kg + 420kg + 130kg + 65kg = 825kg

The original plan was to sell 500kg of meat. So, the amount of meat they sold beyond their original plans is:
* 825kg - 500kg = 325kg

Answer: 325
