Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 10 books on the table.
2) Two-fifths of the books are reading books. 
   * 2/5 of 10 books = 4 reading books.
3) Three-tenths of the books are math books.
   * 3/10 of 10 books = 3 math books.
4) There is one fewer science book than math books.
   * Since there are 3 math books, there must be 2 science books.
5) The remaining books must be history books.
   * Total books = 10
   * Reading books = 4
   * Math books = 3
   * Science books = 2
   * History books = 10 - 4 - 3 - 2 = 1 history book.

Answer: 1 history book.
