Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tina's classroom has the same amount of students as Maura's classroom.
2) Zack's classroom has half the amount of total students between Tina and Maura's classrooms.
3) When Zack was sick, there were 22 students in his class.
4) Since Zack's classroom has half the amount of total students between Tina and Maura's classrooms, we can say that the total number of students in Tina and Maura's classrooms is 2 * 22 = 44.
5) Since Tina's classroom has the same amount of students as Maura's classroom, we can say that each of their classrooms has 44 / 2 = 22 students.
6) The total number of students between the 3 classrooms is therefore 22 + 22 + 22 = 66.

Answer: 66
