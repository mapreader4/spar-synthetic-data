Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The hospital initially has 11 doctors and 18 nurses.
2) 5 doctors and 2 nurses quit.
3) To find the number of doctors and nurses left, we need to subtract the number of doctors and nurses who quit from the initial numbers.
4) The number of doctors left = 11 - 5 = 6 doctors.
5) The number of nurses left = 18 - 2 = 16 nurses.

Answer: 6 doctors and 16 nurses.
