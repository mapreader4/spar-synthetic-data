Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, so the total cost of the soft drinks is 2 * $4 = $8.
2) Benny spent a total of $28.
3) The cost of the soft drinks is $8, so the remaining amount spent must be on the candy bars.
4) The remaining amount spent on the candy bars is $28 - $8 = $20.
5) Benny bought 5 candy bars, so the cost of each candy bar is $20 / 5 = $4.

Answer: $4
