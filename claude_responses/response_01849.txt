Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are two museums that Jennifer wants to visit.
2) The first museum is 5 miles away from her home.
3) The second museum is 15 miles away from her home.
4) Jennifer will visit each museum on a separate day.
5) To get to the first museum, Jennifer will travel 5 miles there and 5 miles back, for a total of 10 miles.
6) To get to the second museum, Jennifer will travel 15 miles there and 15 miles back, for a total of 30 miles.
7) The total distance Jennifer will travel is the sum of the distances for each museum visit:
