Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The park warden issued a total of 24 citations over the past three hours
* The number of citations issued for littering is the same as the number issued for off-leash dogs
* The number of citations issued for other parking fines is double the number issued for littering and off-leash dogs

Let's call the number of littering citations and off-leash dog citations "x".
Then the number of parking fine citations is "2x".

The total number of citations is 24, so we can write the equation:
x + x + 2x = 24

Simplifying, we get:
4x = 24
x = 6

Therefore, the warden issued 6 littering citations.

Answer: 6
