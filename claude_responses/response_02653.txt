Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary and her two friends agreed to evenly pay for the cost of 2 pounds of chicken
* Mary's mother bought:
  - 2 pounds of chicken
  - 3 pounds of beef at $4 per pound
  - 1 liter of oil at $1
* The total cost of the grocery was $16
* To find out how much Mary and her two friends should pay each for the chicken, we need to:
  1. Calculate the cost of the chicken
  2. Divide the cost of the chicken by 3 (since there are 3 of them)

Step 1: Calculating the cost of the chicken
* The cost of the 3 pounds of beef is 3 x $4 = $12
* The cost of the 1 liter of oil is $1
* The total cost of the grocery is $16
* So the cost of the chicken must be $16 - $12 - $1 = $3

Step 2: Dividing the cost of the chicken by 3
* The cost of the chicken is $3
* Dividing $3 by 3 gives us $1 per person

Answer: $1
