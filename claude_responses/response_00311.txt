Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bus has 23 rows of 4 seats, so the total number of seats on the bus is 23 * 4 = 92 seats.
2) At the start, 16 people climb on the bus, so the number of empty seats is 92 - 16 = 76 empty seats.
3) At the first stop, 15 people board the bus and 3 get off. So the number of people on the bus is now 16 + 15 - 3 = 28. The number of empty seats is 92 - 28 = 64 empty seats.
4) At the second stop, 17 people get on the bus and 10 get off. So the number of people on the bus is now 28 + 17 - 10 = 35. The number of empty seats is 92 - 35 = 57 empty seats.
