Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tina's pail holds 4 gallons
* Tommy's pail holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, so it holds 6 gallons
* Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 12 gallons
* Each of them makes 3 trips to fill the pool
* So, for each trip:
    - Tina adds 4 gallons
    - Tommy adds 6 gallons
    - Timmy adds 12 gallons
* After 3 trips each:
    - Tina adds 4 x 3 = 12 gallons
    - Tommy adds 6 x 3 = 18 gallons
    - Timmy adds 12 x 3 = 36 gallons
* The total amount of water added to the pool is:
    - 12 + 18 + 36 = 66 gallons

Answer: 66
