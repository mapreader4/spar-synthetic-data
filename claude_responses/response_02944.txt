Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Jane runs 3 kilometers in two hours
* 1 kilometer = 1000 meters
* So, Jane runs 3 x 1000 = 3000 meters in two hours
* To find her speed in meters per minute, we need to divide the total distance by the total time
* 3000 meters / 120 minutes (2 hours) = 25 meters per minute
Answer: 25
