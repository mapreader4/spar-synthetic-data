Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The smallest layer of the cake requires 2 cups of sugar
* The second layer is twice as big as the first layer
* So the second layer requires 2 x 2 = 4 cups of sugar
* The third layer is three times larger than the second layer
* So the third layer requires 4 x 3 = 12 cups of sugar

Answer: 12
