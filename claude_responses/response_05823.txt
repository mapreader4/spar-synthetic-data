Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The faucet drips 10 times per minute
* Each drop contains 0.05 mL of water
* We want to find the total amount of water wasted in one hour

First, let's calculate the number of drops in one hour:
* 10 drops per minute x 60 minutes = 600 drops per hour

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water wasted in one hour:
* 600 drops per hour x 0.05 mL per drop = 30 mL per hour

Answer: 30 mL
