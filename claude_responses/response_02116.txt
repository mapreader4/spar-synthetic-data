Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rodney is a door-to-door salesman selling home security systems
* He gets a commission of $25 for each system he sells
* He is canvassing a neighborhood of four streets with eight houses each
* The first street gave him half the sales that the second street did
* Every house on the third street turned him away
* The fourth street resulted in only one sale
* His total commission was $175

To find the number of security systems he sold on the second street, we need to set up an equation.

Let's call the number of sales on the second street "x".

We know that:
* The first street had half the sales of the second street, so the first street had x/2 sales
* The third street had 0 sales
* The fourth street had 1 sale

The total number of sales is the sum of the sales on each street:
* Total sales = (x/2) + 0 + 1 + x = (x/2) + x + 1

We also know that his total commission was $175, and each sale earns him $25.
* Total commission = $25 * (total sales)
* $175 = $25 * ((x/2) + x + 1)

Solving this equation:
* $175 = $25 * (1.5x + 1)
* $175 = $37.5x + $25
* $150 = $37.5x
* x = 4

Therefore, Rodney sold 4 security systems on the second street.
