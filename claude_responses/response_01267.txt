Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) On Tuesday, Liza had $800 in her checking account.
2) On Wednesday, she paid her rent of $450, so her account balance is now $800 - $450 = $350.
3) On Thursday, she deposited her $1500 paycheck, so her account balance is now $350 + $1500 = $1850.
4) On Friday, she paid her electricity bill of $117 and her internet bill of $100, so her account balance is now $1850 - $117 - $100 = $1633.
5) On Saturday, she paid her phone bill of $70, so her account balance is now $1633 - $70 = $1563.

Answer: $1563
