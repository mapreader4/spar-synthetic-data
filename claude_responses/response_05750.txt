Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sophie's mom gave her 20 oranges every day
* Hannah's dad gave her 40 grapes every day
* We need to calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in 30 days

For Sophie:
* 20 oranges per day x 30 days = 600 oranges

For Hannah:
* 40 grapes per day x 30 days = 1,200 grapes

Now, we add the total number of oranges and grapes:
* 600 oranges + 1,200 grapes = 1,800 fruits

Answer: 1,800
