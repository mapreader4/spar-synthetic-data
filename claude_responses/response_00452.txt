Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emily starts with 6 marbles.
2) Megan gives Emily double the number of marbles she has, which is 2 x 6 = 12 marbles.
3) So now Emily has 6 + 12 = 18 marbles.
4) Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1, which is (18 / 2) + 1 = 10 marbles.
5) So now Emily has 18 - 10 = 8 marbles.
