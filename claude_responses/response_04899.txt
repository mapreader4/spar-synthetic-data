Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Robin's friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, and Patrice
* For each friend, Robin will buy one bracelet for each letter in their first name
* Jessica has 7 letters, so Robin will buy 7 bracelets for Jessica
* Tori has 4 letters, so Robin will buy 4 bracelets for Tori
* Lily has 4 letters, so Robin will buy 4 bracelets for Lily
* Patrice has 7 letters, so Robin will buy 7 bracelets for Patrice
* Each bracelet costs $2
* To calculate the total, we add up the number of bracelets for each friend:
7 + 4 + 4 + 7 = 22 bracelets
* Since each bracelet costs $2, the total Robin will spend is:
22 bracelets x $2 per bracelet = $44

Answer: 44
