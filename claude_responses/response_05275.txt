Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peggy has 75 stamps in her collection
* Ernie has 3 times as many stamps as Peggy
* So, Ernie has 3 * 75 = 225 stamps
* Bert has 4 times as many stamps as Ernie
* So, Bert has 4 * 225 = 900 stamps
* To find how many stamps Peggy needs to add to her collection to have a collection as large as Bert's, we subtract Peggy's current collection from Bert's collection:
* 900 - 75 = 825

Answer: 825
