Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tina made a pan of brownies and cut it into 24 pieces
* Tina had 1 brownie per day for 5 days, so she had 5 brownies
* Tina's husband had 1 brownie per day for 5 days, so he had 5 brownies
* They shared 4 brownies with dinner guests
* To calculate the total number of brownies consumed:
    - Tina's brownies: 5
    - Husband's brownies: 5
    - Dinner guests' brownies: 4
    - Total brownies consumed: 5 + 5 + 4 = 14
* The original pan had 24 brownies
* So the number of brownies left is:
    - Original brownies: 24
    - Brownies consumed: 14
    - Brownies left: 24 - 14 = 10

Answer: 10
