Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A large puzzle costs $15
* A small puzzle and a large puzzle together cost $23
* We want to find the cost of 1 large and 3 small puzzles

First, let's find the cost of a small puzzle.
* We know that a small puzzle and a large puzzle together cost $23
* So, the cost of a small puzzle must be $23 - $15 = $8

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 1 large and 3 small puzzles.
* 1 large puzzle costs $15
* 3 small puzzles cost 3 x $8 = $24
* Total cost = $15 + $24 = $39

Answer: 39
