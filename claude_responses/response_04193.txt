Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hayden spends 5 minutes ironing his button-up shirt and 3 minutes ironing his pants.
2) He does this 5 days a week.
3) So, each week he spends:
   - 5 minutes x 5 days = 25 minutes ironing his shirt
   - 3 minutes x 5 days = 15 minutes ironing his pants
   - Total time per week = 25 minutes + 15 minutes = 40 minutes
4) Over 4 weeks, the total time spent ironing would be:
   - 40 minutes x 4 weeks = 160 minutes

Answer: 160 minutes
