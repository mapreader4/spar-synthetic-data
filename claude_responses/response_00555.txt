Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brian has 22 pairs of shoes
* Edward has 3 times the number of shoes that Brian has
* So, Edward has 3 x 22 = 66 pairs of shoes
* Jacob has half the number of shoes that Edward has
* So, Jacob has 66 / 2 = 33 pairs of shoes
* Now, to find the total number of pairs of shoes they have, we add up the number of pairs of shoes for each person:
* Brian: 22 pairs
* Edward: 66 pairs
* Jacob: 33 pairs
* Total: 22 + 66 + 33 = 121 pairs of shoes

Answer: 121
