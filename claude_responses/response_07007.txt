Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jade has 100 lego pieces total
* Each level of the tower needs to be 7 pieces wide
* She has 23 pieces left at the end

To find the number of levels in the tower, we need to first find out how many pieces were used in the tower.
* Total pieces - Pieces left at the end = Pieces used in the tower
* 100 - 23 = 77 pieces used in the tower

Now, we need to find out how many levels can be built with 77 pieces, given that each level requires 7 pieces.
* Pieces used in the tower / Pieces per level = Number of levels
* 77 / 7 = 11 levels

Therefore, Jade's tower has 11 levels.

Answer: 11
