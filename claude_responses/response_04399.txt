Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lily has $60 to spend at the supermarket
* She needs to buy 6 items: celery, cereal, bread, milk, potatoes, and coffee
* The prices of the items are:
  - Celery: $5
  - Cereal: 50% off $12, so $6
  - Bread: $8
  - Milk: 10% off $10, so $9
  - Potatoes: $1 each, and she buys 6, so $6
* So the total cost of the 5 items (excluding coffee) is:
  - Celery: $5
  - Cereal: $6
  - Bread: $8
  - Milk: $9
  - Potatoes: $6
  - Total: $5 + $6 + $8 + $9 + $6 = $34
* Lily had $60 to spend, and she has spent $34 so far.
* Therefore, the amount of money Lily has left to spend on coffee is:
  - $60 - $34 = $26

Answer: $26
