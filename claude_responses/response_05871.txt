Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tayzia and her two young daughters get haircuts
* Women's haircuts are $48 each
* Children's haircuts are $36 each
* Tayzia wants to give a 20% tip to the hair stylist

To calculate the total cost of the haircuts:
* 1 women's haircut (Tayzia) = $48
* 2 children's haircuts (Tayzia's daughters) = 2 x $36 = $72
* Total cost of haircuts = $48 + $72 = $120

Now, to calculate the tip amount:
* The tip is 20% of the total cost of the haircuts
* 20% of $120 = 0.20 x $120 = $24

Therefore, the tip amount would be:
Answer: $24
