Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* At 7 weeks old, the puppy weighed 6 pounds.
* By week 9, the puppy had doubled in weight, so it now weighed 6 x 2 = 12 pounds.
* At 3 months old, the puppy doubled in weight again, so it now weighed 12 x 2 = 24 pounds.
* At 5 months old, the puppy doubled in weight again, so it now weighed 24 x 2 = 48 pounds.
* By the time the dog was one year old, it added another 30 pounds to reach its final adult weight.
* So the final adult weight of the dog is 48 + 30 = 78 pounds.

Answer: 78 pounds.
