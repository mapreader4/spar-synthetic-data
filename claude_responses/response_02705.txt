Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maximoff's original monthly bill is $60 per month.
2) The bill increased by 30% when he started working from home.
3) To calculate the new monthly bill, we need to find 30% of the original bill and add it to the original bill.
4) 30% of $60 is 0.3 * $60 = $18.
5) Adding the $18 increase to the original $60 bill, we get $60 + $18 = $78.

Answer: $78
