Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Rebecca bought 22 items in total for her camping trip
* She bought 3 times as many packets of drink mix as tent stakes
* She bought 2 more bottles of water than she did tent stakes
* Let's call the number of tent stakes she bought 'x'
* Then, the number of packets of drink mix she bought is 3x
* And the number of bottles of water she bought is x + 2
* The total number of items she bought is 22, so we can write the equation:
x + 3x + (x + 2) = 22
* Simplifying this equation, we get:
5x + 2 = 22
* Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:
5x = 20
* Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
x = 4
* Therefore, the number of tent stakes Rebecca bought is 4.
