Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Amoli drove 42 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   * Distance traveled by Amoli = 42 miles/hour × 3 hours = 126 miles

2. Anayet drove 61 miles per hour for 2 hours.
   * Distance traveled by Anayet = 61 miles/hour × 2 hours = 122 miles

3. The total distance traveled by both Amoli and Anayet is:
   * Total distance traveled = 126 miles + 122 miles = 248 miles

4. The total distance they need to travel is 369 miles.
   * Remaining distance to travel = 369 miles - 248 miles = 121 miles

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 121 miles
