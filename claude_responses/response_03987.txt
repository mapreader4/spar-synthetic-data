Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The survey asked students about their favorite sports
* 40% said they like basketball
* 10% said they like chess
* 28% said they like soccer
* The remaining students said they like badminton
* The total number of students interviewed was 250

To find the number of students who identified chess or basketball as their favorite sport, we need to calculate the number of students for each of those sports:

Basketball:
* 40% of 250 students = 0.40 * 250 = 100 students

Chess: 
* 10% of 250 students = 0.10 * 250 = 25 students

Adding these together, we get:
* 100 basketball students + 25 chess students = 125 students

Answer: 125
