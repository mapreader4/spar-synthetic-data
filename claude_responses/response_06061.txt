Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Josh has a total of 85 marbles
2) There are three times as many blue marbles as red marbles
3) The number of red marbles is 14
4) To find the number of blue marbles, we can multiply the number of red marbles by 3:
   * Number of blue marbles = 3 x 14 = 42
5) Now we can find the number of yellow marbles by subtracting the number of red and blue marbles from the total number of marbles:
   * Number of yellow marbles = 85 - 14 - 42 = 29

Answer: 29
