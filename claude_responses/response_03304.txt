Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The problem states that there are four times as many apples as oranges in the fruit basket.
2) The basket has 15 apples.
3) To find the number of oranges, we can divide the number of apples by 4, since there are four times as many apples as oranges.
15 apples / 4 = 3.75 oranges (rounded down to 3 oranges)
4) So the total number of fruits in the basket is 15 apples + 3 oranges = 18 fruits.
5) The problem states that Emiliano eats 2/3 of each fruit's quantity in the basket.
6) To find the total number of fruits Emiliano consumed, we multiply the total number of fruits in the basket (18) by 2/3.
18 fruits * 2/3 = 12 fruits.

Answer: 12
