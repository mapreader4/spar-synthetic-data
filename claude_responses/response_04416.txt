Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car
* For a rental that lasts an entire week or longer, the agency charges $190 for the first week
* Jennie rented a car for 11 days

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost for the first week and the cost for the remaining days.

For the first week (7 days), the cost is $190.
For the remaining 4 days, the cost is 4 * $30 = $120.

Therefore, the total cost for Jennie's 11-day rental is:
$190 + $120 = $310

Answer: 310
