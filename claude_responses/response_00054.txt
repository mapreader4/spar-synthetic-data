Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Leah earned $28 working odd jobs.
2) She spent a seventh of that on a milkshake. A seventh of $28 is $4, so she spent $4 on a milkshake.
3) She put half of the remaining money in her savings account. The remaining money after the milkshake purchase is $28 - $4 = $24. Half of $24 is $12, so she put $12 in her savings account.
4) The remaining money in her wallet was $24 - $12 = $12.
5) Her dog shredded all the money in her wallet except for $1.
6) Therefore, Leah lost $12 - $1 = $11.

Answer: $11
