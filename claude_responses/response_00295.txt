Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pam has some bags of apples
2) Each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags
3) Gerald's bags have 40 apples each
4) Pam has 1200 apples in total

To find the number of bags Pam has, we need to first find how many apples are in each of Pam's bags.

Since each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, and Gerald's bags have 40 apples each, we can calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags:
* Each of Pam's bags has 3 x 40 = 120 apples

Now, we can calculate the number of bags Pam has by dividing the total number of apples (1200) by the number of apples in each of her bags (120):
* Number of bags Pam has = 1200 / 120 = 10

Answer: 10
