Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) A dozen is 12 bandages.
2) Two dozen is 24 bandages.
3) The box of bandages had 8 less than two dozen bandages before Peggy skinned her knees.
4) 2 dozen - 8 = 24 - 8 = 16 bandages in the box before Peggy skinned her knees.
5) Peggy needed 2 bandages on her left knee and 3 bandages on her right knee, for a total of 5 bandages.
6) 16 bandages - 5 bandages = 11 bandages left in the box after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees.
