Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Juliet is 10 years old
* Juliet is 3 years older than her sister Maggie
* Therefore, Maggie is 10 - 3 = 7 years old
* Juliet is 2 years younger than her elder brother Ralph
* Therefore, Ralph is 10 + 2 = 12 years old
* The sum of Maggie's and Ralph's ages is 7 + 12 = 19

Answer: 19
