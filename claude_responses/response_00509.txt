Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The electricity price in Coco's town is $0.10 per kW.
2) Coco's new oven has a consumption rate of 2.4 kWh (kilowatt-hours).
3) Coco used the oven for a total of 25 hours last month.
4) To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total energy consumed by the oven and multiply it by the electricity price.
5) The total energy consumed by the oven is the consumption rate (2.4 kWh) multiplied by the total hours used (25 hours).
6) 2.4 kWh x 25 hours = 60 kWh.
7) The total cost is the total energy consumed (60 kWh) multiplied by the electricity price ($0.10 per kW).
8) 60 kWh x $0.10 per kW = $6.00.

Answer: $6.00.
