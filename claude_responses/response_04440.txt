Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sherry wants to make 99 loaves of banana bread.
2) Her recipe makes enough batter for 3 loaves.
3) The recipe calls for 1 banana per loaf.
4) To calculate the number of bananas needed, we first need to find out how many batches of the recipe Sherry needs to make.
5) Since each batch makes 3 loaves, and Sherry needs 99 loaves, we can divide 99 by 3 to find the number of batches needed.
6) 99 / 3 = 33 batches.
7) Since each batch requires 1 banana, and Sherry needs 33 batches, she will need 33 bananas.

Answer: 33
