Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The old bridge had 5 lanes and 2000 vehicles passing through it every month.
2) The new bridge has twice the capacity of the old one, so it has 10 lanes.
3) The number of vehicles passing through the new bridge increased by 60% more than the old bridge.
   - The old bridge had 2000 vehicles per month.
   - The new bridge has 60% more, which is 2000 + (2000 * 0.6) = 3200 vehicles per month.
4) The bridges work concurrently for a year, which is 12 months.
5) To calculate the total number of vehicles that pass through the two bridges:
   - Old bridge: 2000 vehicles/month * 12 months = 24,000 vehicles
   - New bridge: 3200 vehicles/month * 12 months = 38,400 vehicles
   - Total vehicles: 24,000 + 38,400 = 62,400 vehicles

Answer: 62,400
