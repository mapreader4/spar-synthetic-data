Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first garden, Phyllis has 20 plants, and 10% of them are tomato plants.
   * 10% of 20 plants = 0.10 * 20 = 2 tomato plants in the first garden.

2. In the second garden, Phyllis has 15 plants, and 1/3 of them are tomato plants.
   * 1/3 of 15 plants = 15 * (1/3) = 5 tomato plants in the second garden.

3. Now we need to find the total number of plants in both gardens:
   * Total plants = 20 (first garden) + 15 (second garden) = 35 plants.

4. The total number of tomato plants is the sum of the tomato plants in each garden:
   * Total tomato plants = 2 (first garden) + 5 (second garden) = 7 tomato plants.

5. To find the percentage of all the plants that are tomato plants, we divide the total tomato plants by the total plants and multiply by 100:
   * Percentage of tomato plants = (7 / 35) * 100 = 20%

Answer: 20%
