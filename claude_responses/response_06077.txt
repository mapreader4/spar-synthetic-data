Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jezebel needs to buy 2 dozens of red roses. 
2) Each red rose costs $1.50.
3) 2 dozens of red roses = 2 x 12 = 24 red roses.
4) 24 red roses at $1.50 each = 24 x $1.50 = $36.
5) Jezebel also needs to buy 3 sunflowers.
6) Each sunflower costs $3.
7) 3 sunflowers at $3 each = 3 x $3 = $9.
8) The total cost for the red roses and sunflowers is $36 + $9 = $45.

Answer: $45
