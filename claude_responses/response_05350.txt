Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Katie has 13 pink marbles.
2) She has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. So, if she has 13 pink marbles, she must have 13 - 9 = 4 orange marbles.
3) She has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. So, if she has 4 orange marbles, she must have 4 * 4 = 16 purple marbles.
4) To find the total number of marbles, we add up the pink, orange, and purple marbles:
13 pink marbles + 4 orange marbles + 16 purple marbles = 33 marbles.

Answer: 33
