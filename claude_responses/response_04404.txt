Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John sells 20 woodburnings for $15 each.
2) The total revenue from selling the 20 woodburnings is:
   20 woodburnings x $15 per woodburning = $300 total revenue
3) The cost of the wood is $100.
4) To calculate the profit, we take the total revenue and subtract the cost of the wood:
   $300 total revenue - $100 cost of wood = $200 profit.

Answer: $200
