Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Violet's family has 1 adult and 6 children
* Adult tickets cost $35 each
* Children's tickets cost $20 each
* To calculate the cost of separate tickets:
* 1 adult ticket at $35 = $35
* 6 children's tickets at $20 each = 6 x $20 = $120
* Total cost of separate tickets = $35 + $120 = $155

Answer: $155
