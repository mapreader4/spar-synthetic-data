Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Each row of corn contains 70 ears
* Each ear of corn requires 2 seeds
* So, each row requires 70 * 2 = 140 seeds
* Each bag of corn seeds contains 48 seeds
* Therefore, to plant one row, you need 140 / 48 = 2.92 bags of corn seeds, which rounds up to 3 bags
* The farmer pays the kids $1.5 per row
* Each kid spends half their earnings on dinner, which costs $36 per kid
* To find how many bags of corn seeds each kid used, we need to work backwards:
* Each kid earns $1.5 per row
* After dinner, they have half of their earnings left
* So, each kid earned $72 before dinner
* Dividing $72 by $1.5 per row, we get 48 rows
* Each row requires 3 bags of corn seeds
* Therefore, each kid used 48 * 3 = 144 bags of corn seeds

Answer: 144
