Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aubrey is planting tomatoes and cucumbers
* For each row of tomato plants, she is planting 2 rows of cucumbers
* She has enough room for 15 rows of plants in total
* There is enough space for 8 tomato plants in each row
* Each tomato plant produces 3 tomatoes

First, let's figure out how many rows of tomato plants she can have. Since she has 2 rows of cucumbers for each row of tomatoes, and she has 15 rows in total, we can calculate the number of tomato rows as:
* Tomato rows = 15 / 3 = 5 rows

Now, we know that each row of tomatoes has 8 tomato plants, and each plant produces 3 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes she will have is:
* Total tomatoes = 5 rows x 8 plants per row x 3 tomatoes per plant
* Total tomatoes = 120 tomatoes

Answer: 120
