Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The patio is a rectangle, so the length and width can be represented as variables.
2) The length is four times the width, so let's say the length is 4w, where w is the width.
3) The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width), so in this case, the perimeter is 2 * (4w + w) = 10w.
4) We are told the perimeter is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: 10w = 100.
5) Solving for w, we get w = 10 feet.
6) Since the length is 4 times the width, the length is 4 * 10 = 40 feet.

Answer: 40 feet
