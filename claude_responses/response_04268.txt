Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Derek starts with $40.
2. Derek spends $14 on his own lunch, $11 on his dad's lunch, and $5 on more of his own lunch.
   - Total spent by Derek: $14 + $11 + $5 = $30
3. Derek has $40 - $30 = $10 left.
4. Dave starts with $50.
5. Dave spends $7 on his mom's lunch.
6. Dave has $50 - $7 = $43 left.
7. The difference between the money Dave has left and the money Derek has left is:
   - $43 - $10 = $33

Answer: $33
