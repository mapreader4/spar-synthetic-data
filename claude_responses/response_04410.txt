Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob has 5 rows of corn
* Each row has 80 corn stalks
* So the total number of corn stalks is 5 rows x 80 stalks per row = 400 corn stalks
* Every 8 corn stalks will produce a bushel of corn
* To calculate the number of bushels, we divide the total number of corn stalks by 8:
* 400 corn stalks / 8 corn stalks per bushel = 50 bushels

Answer: 50 bushels
