Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joey studies 2 hours per night, 5 nights a week
* 2 hours per night x 5 nights = 10 hours per week
* On the weekends, he studies 3 hours a day
* On Saturday and Sunday, that's 6 hours per weekend
* So in total for the weekends, that's 6 hours per weekend
* The exam is 6 weeks away
* So for the 5 weekdays, he'll study 10 hours per week for 6 weeks
* That's 10 hours x 6 weeks = 60 hours
* And for the 2 weekend days, he'll study 6 hours per weekend for 6 weekends
* That's 6 hours x 6 weekends = 36 hours
* Adding the weekday and weekend hours:
* 60 hours + 36 hours = 96 hours

Answer: 96 hours
