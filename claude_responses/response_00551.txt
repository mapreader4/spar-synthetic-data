Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Arlene hiked 24 miles on Saturday
* She carried a 60-pound backpack
* She is exactly 5 feet tall
* She spent 6 hours hiking
* The temperature during the day was 60 degrees Fahrenheit

To calculate Arlene's average hiking pace, we need to divide the total distance hiked by the total time spent hiking.

The total distance hiked is 24 miles.
The total time spent hiking is 6 hours.

Therefore, Arlene's average hiking pace is:
* 24 miles / 6 hours = 4 miles per hour
