Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nigel won $45.
2) He gave some of that $45 away.
3) His mother then gave him $80 more.
4) Now, Nigel has $10 more than twice the amount he originally had.

Let's call the amount he gave away 'x'.
* Originally, Nigel had $45 - x
* After his mother gave him $80, he had $45 - x + $80 = $125 - x
* The question states that he now has $10 more than twice the amount he originally had.
* Twice the amount he originally had is 2 * ($45 - x) = $90 - 2x
* He has $10 more than that, so his current amount is $90 - 2x + $10 = $100 - 2x

We can set up an equation:
$100 - 2x = $125 - x
-x = $25
x = $25

Therefore, the amount of money Nigel gave away is $25.

Answer: $25
