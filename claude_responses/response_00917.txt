Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt can climb 6 feet per minute
* Jason can climb 12 feet per minute
* They have been climbing for 7 minutes

To find how much higher Jason will be than Matt, we need to calculate the distance each of them has climbed in 7 minutes.

Matt's distance climbed:
* 6 feet/minute x 7 minutes = 42 feet

Jason's distance climbed:
* 12 feet/minute x 7 minutes = 84 feet

Now, to find how much higher Jason will be than Matt, we subtract Matt's distance from Jason's distance:
* 84 feet - 42 feet = 42 feet

Answer: 42
