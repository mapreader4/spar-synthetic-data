Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 400 students in the senior class at East High School.
2) 52% of the students play sports. To find the number of students who play sports, we take 52% of 400:
   * 52% of 400 = 0.52 * 400 = 208 students play sports.
3) Of the 208 students who play sports, 12.5% play soccer. To find the number of students who play soccer, we take 12.5% of 208:
   * 12.5% of 208 = 0.125 * 208 = 26 students play soccer.

Answer: 26 students play soccer.
