Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peter needs 80 ounces of soda for his party
* The soda cans are 8 oz each
* The cost of each 8 oz can is $0.50

To find the number of cans Peter needs to buy, we divide the total ounces needed (80) by the ounces per can (8):
* 80 ounces / 8 ounces per can = 10 cans

Now, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of cans (10) by the cost per can ($0.50):
* 10 cans x $0.50 per can = $5.00

Answer: $5.00
