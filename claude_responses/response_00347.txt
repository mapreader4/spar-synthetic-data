Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yesterday, Jeremy listened to 9 songs
* Today, Jeremy listened to 5 more songs than yesterday
* To find the number of songs listened to today, we add 5 to the number of songs listened to yesterday:
    * Today's songs = 9 + 5 = 14 songs
* To find the total number of songs listened to in two days, we add the number of songs listened to yesterday and today:
    * Total songs = 9 + 14 = 23 songs

Answer: 23
