Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Martin starts with 18 goldfish
* Each week, 5 goldfish die
* Each week, Martin purchases 3 new goldfish
* We want to know how many goldfish Martin will have in 7 weeks

So, let's calculate the changes in the number of goldfish over the 7 weeks:
* Week 1: 18 - 5 + 3 = 16 goldfish
* Week 2: 16 - 5 + 3 = 14 goldfish
* Week 3: 14 - 5 + 3 = 12 goldfish
* Week 4: 12 - 5 + 3 = 10 goldfish
* Week 5: 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 goldfish
* Week 6: 8 - 5 + 3 = 6 goldfish
* Week 7: 6 - 5 + 3 = 4 goldfish

Therefore, after 7 weeks, Martin will have 4 goldfish.
