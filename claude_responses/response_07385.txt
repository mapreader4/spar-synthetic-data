Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The cube of silver has dimensions of 3 inches on each side.
2) The volume of the cube is 3 inches x 3 inches x 3 inches = 27 cubic inches.
3) Each cubic inch of silver weighs 6 ounces.
4) Therefore, the total weight of the silver cube is 27 cubic inches x 6 ounces/cubic inch = 162 ounces.
5) Each ounce of silver sells for $25.
6) The total value of the silver is 162 ounces x $25/ounce = $4,050.
7) Bob sells the silver for 110% of its silver value, which is $4,050 x 1.1 = $4,455.

Answer: $4,455
