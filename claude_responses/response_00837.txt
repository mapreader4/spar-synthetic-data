Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 36 legs tangled up in leashes.
2) Each dog has 4 legs.
3) Mariel is walking a pack of dogs, and the other dog walker has 3 dogs.
4) So the total number of dogs tangled up is the number of Mariel's dogs plus 3.
5) Let's call the number of Mariel's dogs x.
6) Then the total number of legs is 4x + 12 (4 legs for Mariel's dogs, and 12 legs for the other 3 dogs).
7) We know the total number of legs is 36, so we can set up an equation:
4x + 12 = 36
8) Solving for x, we get:
4x = 24
x = 6
9) Therefore, Mariel is walking 6 dogs.
