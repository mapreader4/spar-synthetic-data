Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James originally weighed 120 kg
* He gained 20% of his body weight in muscle
* To calculate the muscle gain:
  * 20% of 120 kg = 0.2 * 120 kg = 24 kg
* He also gained 1 quarter of the muscle gain in fat
* To calculate the fat gain:
  * 1 quarter of 24 kg = 0.25 * 24 kg = 6 kg
* So the total weight gain is:
  * Muscle gain: 24 kg
  * Fat gain: 6 kg
  * Total gain: 24 kg + 6 kg = 30 kg
* Therefore, his new weight is:
  * Original weight: 120 kg
  * Weight gain: 30 kg
  * New weight: 120 kg + 30 kg = 150 kg

Answer: 150 kg
