Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Tapanga and Corey have a total of 66 candies together.
2) Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey.
3) Let's represent Corey's number of candies as x.
4) Then, Tapanga's number of candies is x + 8.
5) The total number of candies is 66, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 8) = 66
6) Simplifying the equation:
2x + 8 = 66
7) Subtracting 8 from both sides:
2x = 58
8) Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 29

Answer: 29
