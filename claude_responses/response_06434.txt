Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Clive has $10 to spend
* He needs 80 olives
* A jar of 20 olives costs $1.50
* To calculate how many jars Clive needs to buy:
    - 80 olives / 20 olives per jar = 4 jars
* To calculate the total cost:
    - 4 jars x $1.50 per jar = $6.00
* To calculate the change Clive will have:
    - $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00
