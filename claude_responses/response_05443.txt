Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maggie collected 50 pieces of candy.
2) Harper collected 30% more candy than Maggie. To calculate this, we take Maggie's 50 pieces and add 30% of 50, which is 15 pieces. So, Harper collected 50 + 15 = 65 pieces of candy.
3) Neil collected 40% more candy than Harper. To calculate this, we take Harper's 65 pieces and add 40% of 65, which is 26 pieces. So, Neil collected 65 + 26 = 91 pieces of candy.

Answer: 91
