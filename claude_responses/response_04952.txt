Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that there are three times as many children as adults attending the concert.
2) Let's say the number of adults is x.
3) Then the number of children is 3x.
4) The total revenue from the ticket sales is $6,000.
5) The revenue from adult tickets is 7x, and the revenue from child tickets is 3x * 3 = 9x.
6) The total revenue is 7x + 9x = 16x.
7) We know the total revenue is $6,000, so 16x = 6,000.
8) Solving for x, we get x = 375.
9) Therefore, the number of adults is 375, and the number of children is 3 * 375 = 1,125.
10) The total number of people who bought tickets is 375 + 1,125 = 1,500.

Answer: 1,500
