Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mike's original typing speed is 65 words per minute
* Due to the accident, his typing speed is now 20 words less per minute, which means his new typing speed is 65 - 20 = 45 words per minute
* The document he needs to type has 810 words
* To calculate the time it will take him to type the document, we need to divide the total number of words (810) by his new typing speed (45 words per minute)
* 810 words / 45 words per minute = 18 minutes

Answer: 18 minutes
