Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Steve writes a letter every 3rd day.
2. Each letter takes 20 minutes to write.
3. It takes 10 minutes to write 1 page.
4. So, in 20 minutes, he can write 2 pages (20 minutes / 10 minutes per page = 2 pages).
5. In a month, there are approximately 30 days.
6. So, Steve writes 10 letters in a month (30 days / 3 days per letter = 10 letters).
7. Each letter is 2 pages long, so the total pages written for the 10 letters is 20 pages (10 letters x 2 pages per letter = 20 pages).
8. Steve also writes a long letter at the end of the month, which takes 80 minutes to write.
9. Since it takes twice as long per page, it takes 20 minutes per page (10 minutes per page x 2 = 20 minutes per page).
10. So, the long letter is 4 pages long (80 minutes / 20 minutes per page = 4 pages).
11. The total number of pages written in a month is 24 pages (20 pages from the 10 letters + 4 pages from the long letter).

Answer: 24 pages
