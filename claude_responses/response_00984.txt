Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Legoland has 5 kangaroos for each koala.
2) We also know that Legoland has 180 kangaroos.
3) To find the number of koalas, we can divide the number of kangaroos by 5, since there are 5 kangaroos for each koala.
4) 180 kangaroos / 5 kangaroos per koala = 36 koalas.
5) To find the total number of kangaroos and koalas, we add the number of kangaroos and the number of koalas:
6) 180 kangaroos + 36 koalas = 216 animals.

Answer: 216
