Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jessica used 8 pieces of paper, each weighing 1/5 of an ounce.
   * Total weight of the paper: 8 x 1/5 = 1.6 ounces
2) The envelope weighs 2/5 of an ounce.
3) The total weight of the letter is the weight of the paper plus the weight of the envelope:
   * Total weight = 1.6 ounces + 0.4 ounces = 2 ounces
4) Jessica needed one stamp per ounce.
   * Since the total weight is 2 ounces, she needed 2 stamps to mail her letter.
