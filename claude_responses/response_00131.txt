Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mitchell had read 10 chapters before 4 o'clock
* Each chapter has 40 pages
* So, before 4 o'clock, Mitchell had read 10 * 40 = 400 pages
* At 4 o'clock, Mitchell had read 20 pages of the 11th chapter
* After 4 o'clock, Mitchell read 2 more chapters
* Each chapter has 40 pages
* So, after 4 o'clock, Mitchell read 2 * 40 = 80 pages
* The total number of pages Mitchell read is the sum of the pages read before 4 o'clock and the pages read after 4 o'clock:
* 400 + 20 + 80 = 500 pages

Answer: 500
