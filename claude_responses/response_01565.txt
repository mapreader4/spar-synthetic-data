Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jane applies a base coat that takes 2 minutes to dry
* She then applies two color coats that take 3 minutes each to dry
* So the two color coats take 3 minutes + 3 minutes = 6 minutes to dry
* Finally, she applies a clear top coat that takes 5 minutes to dry
* To calculate the total time:
* Base coat: 2 minutes
* Two color coats: 6 minutes
* Clear top coat: 5 minutes
* Total time = 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 5 minutes = 13 minutes

Answer: 13 minutes
