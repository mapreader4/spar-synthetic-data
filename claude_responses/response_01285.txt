Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are twice as many surfers on Malibu beach as in Santa Monica beach.
2) We are told that there are 20 surfers in Santa Monica beach.
3) Since there are twice as many surfers on Malibu beach, that means there are 2 x 20 = 40 surfers on Malibu beach.
4) To calculate the total number of surfers on the two beaches, we add the number of surfers on Malibu beach (40) and the number of surfers on Santa Monica beach (20).
5) 40 + 20 = 60 total surfers.

Answer: 60
