Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Kwik-e-Tax Center charges:
  - $50 for a federal return
  - $30 for a state return
  - $80 for quarterly business taxes
* They sold:
  - 60 federal returns
  - 20 state returns
  - 10 quarterly returns
* To calculate the total revenue for the day, we need to multiply the number of each type of return by the corresponding price, and then add them all up.

Federal return revenue:
* 60 federal returns x $50 per return = $3,000

State return revenue:
* 20 state returns x $30 per return = $600

Quarterly return revenue:
* 10 quarterly returns x $80 per return = $800

Total revenue for the day:
* $3,000 + $600 + $800 = $4,400

Answer: $4,400
