Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The leaf is blown forward 5 feet by each gust of wind
* After each gust, the wind swirls and blows the leaf back 2 feet
* We are considering 11 gusts of wind

So, for each gust:
* The leaf is blown forward 5 feet
* Then it is blown back 2 feet
* The net distance traveled is 5 feet - 2 feet = 3 feet

Now, we need to calculate the total distance traveled after 11 gusts:
* 11 gusts x 3 feet per gust = 33 feet

Therefore, the leaf has traveled 33 feet down the sidewalk after 11 gusts of wind.

Answer: 33
