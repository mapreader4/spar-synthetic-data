Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, Alice baked 74 chocolate chip cookies and Bob baked 7 peanut butter cookies.
* After accidentally throwing some on the floor, Alice baked 5 more cookies and Bob baked 36 more.
* At the end, they had 93 edible cookies.

To find the number of cookies that were accidentally thrown on the floor, we need to calculate the total number of cookies baked and then subtract the number of edible cookies.

The total number of cookies baked:
* Alice's initial 74 + 5 more = 79 cookies
* Bob's initial 7 + 36 more = 43 cookies
* Total cookies baked = 79 + 43 = 122 cookies

Now, we subtract the 93 edible cookies from the total 122 cookies baked:
* 122 cookies - 93 edible cookies = 29 cookies accidentally thrown on the floor

Answer: 29
