Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Texas Integrated School originally had 15 classes
* Each class had 20 students
* So the original number of students was:
  * 15 classes x 20 students per class = 300 students
* They added 5 more classes
* So the new number of classes is:
  * 15 classes + 5 classes = 20 classes
* And the new number of students is:
  * 20 classes x 20 students per class = 400 students

Answer: 400
