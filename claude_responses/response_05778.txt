Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carl needs to drive for 2 hours every day
* There are 7 days in a week
* So in one week, Carl drives for 2 hours x 7 days = 14 hours
* After his promotion, he needs to drive for 6 more hours every week
* So in one week, Carl drives for 14 hours + 6 hours = 20 hours
* In two weeks, Carl drives for 20 hours x 2 weeks = 40 hours

Answer: 40 hours
