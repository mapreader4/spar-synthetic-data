Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 40% of the minnows have red bellies
* 30% of the minnows have green bellies
* The remaining minnows have white bellies
* We are told that 20 minnows have red bellies
* Since 40% of the minnows have red bellies, and there are 20 red-bellied minnows, we can calculate the total number of minnows:
* 20 minnows = 40% of the total minnows
* Total minnows = 20 / 0.40 = 50 minnows
* Now we can calculate the number of minnows with green bellies:
* 30% of 50 minnows = 0.30 * 50 = 15 minnows with green bellies
* Finally, we can calculate the number of minnows with white bellies:
* Total minnows - minnows with red bellies - minnows with green bellies = minnows with white bellies
* 50 - 20 - 15 = 15 minnows with white bellies

Answer: 15 minnows have white bellies.
