Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ruby ordered 1 pepperoni pizza for her son
* Ruby ordered 1 sausage pizza for her daughter
* Ruby and her husband split 1 black olive and mushroom pizza
* The pizza restaurant charged $10.00 per pizza
* The pizza restaurant charged $1.00 per topping
* Ruby needed to add a $5.00 tip

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
* 1 pepperoni pizza = $10.00
* 1 sausage pizza = $10.00
* 1 black olive and mushroom pizza = $10.00 + $1.00 (for 2 toppings) = $11.00
* Tip = $5.00

Total cost = $10.00 + $10.00 + $11.00 + $5.00 = $36.00
