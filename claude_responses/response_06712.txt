Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Candace walks 6 miles per hour in the old shoes
* The new high-tech shoes will help her walk twice as fast, which means she'll walk 12 miles per hour in the new shoes
* However, the new shoes are not broken in yet, so she'll get 1 blister after every 2 hours she spends walking in them
* Since the hike is 4 hours long, she'll get 2 blisters (4 hours / 2 hours per blister = 2 blisters)
* Each blister slows her down by 2 miles per hour
* So with 2 blisters, she'll be slowed down by 4 miles per hour (2 blisters x 2 miles per hour per blister = 4 miles per hour)
* Therefore, her new speed in the high-tech shoes will be 12 miles per hour - 4 miles per hour = 8 miles per hour

Answer: 8 miles per hour
