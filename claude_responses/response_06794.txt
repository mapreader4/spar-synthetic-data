Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Muffins cost $2 each
* Francis had 2 muffins, so that's 2 x $2 = $4 for Francis's muffins
* Kiera had 2 muffins, so that's 2 x $2 = $4 for Kiera's muffins
* Fruit cups cost $3 each
* Francis had 2 fruit cups, so that's 2 x $3 = $6 for Francis's fruit cups
* Kiera had 1 fruit cup, so that's 1 x $3 = $3 for Kiera's fruit cup
* To calculate the total cost, we add up the costs for each person:
* Francis's total: $4 + $6 = $10
* Kiera's total: $4 + $3 = $7
* The total cost for their breakfast is $10 + $7 = $17
