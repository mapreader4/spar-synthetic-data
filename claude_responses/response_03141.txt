Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John eats 3 meals a day
* Breakfast is 500 calories
* Lunch contains 25% more calories than breakfast
* To calculate the calories in lunch:
  - Breakfast is 500 calories
  - 25% more than 500 is 125 calories
  - So lunch is 500 + 125 = 625 calories
* Dinner is twice as many calories as lunch
  - Lunch is 625 calories
  - Dinner is 2 x 625 = 1250 calories
* He also has 3 shakes that are each 300 calories
  - 3 shakes x 300 calories = 900 calories

Now, to calculate the total calories he gets in a day:
* Breakfast: 500 calories
* Lunch: 625 calories
* Dinner: 1250 calories
* Shakes: 900 calories
* Total calories: 500 + 625 + 1250 + 900 = 3275 calories

Answer: 3275
