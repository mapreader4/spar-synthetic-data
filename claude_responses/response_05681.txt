Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jill bought 5 packs of red bouncy balls.
2) Each pack of red bouncy balls contains 18 balls.
3) So the total number of red bouncy balls Jill bought is 5 packs x 18 balls per pack = 90 red bouncy balls.
4) Jill bought 4 packs of yellow bouncy balls.
5) Each pack of yellow bouncy balls contains 18 balls.
6) So the total number of yellow bouncy balls Jill bought is 4 packs x 18 balls per pack = 72 yellow bouncy balls.
7) To find the difference between the number of red and yellow bouncy balls, we subtract the number of yellow bouncy balls from the number of red bouncy balls.
8) 90 red bouncy balls - 72 yellow bouncy balls = 18 more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls.

Answer: 18
