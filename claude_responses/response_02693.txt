Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John earned $100,000 for the year.
2) He has $30,000 in deductions.
3) His taxable income is $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000.
4) The first $20,000 of taxable income is taxed at 10%, so that's 10% of $20,000 = $2,000.
5) The remaining $50,000 of taxable income is taxed at 20%, so that's 20% of $50,000 = $10,000.
6) The total amount of taxes John pays is $2,000 + $10,000 = $12,000.

Answer: $12,000
