Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Selena and Josh ran a total of 36 miles together.
2) Josh ran half the distance that Selena ran.
3) Let's represent Selena's distance as x miles.
4) Since Josh ran half the distance that Selena ran, his distance is x/2 miles.
5) The total distance they ran is the sum of Selena's distance and Josh's distance: x + x/2 = 36
6) Solving for x, we get:
x + x/2 = 36
1.5x = 36
x = 24

Answer: 24 miles
