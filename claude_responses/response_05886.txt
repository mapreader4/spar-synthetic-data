Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 20% of the students are in the band
* 168 students are in the band
* We need to find the total number of students in the middle school

To find the total number of students, we can use the following equation:
* 20% of the total students = 168 students
* 0.20 * total students = 168
* Total students = 168 / 0.20
* Total students = 840

Therefore, the total number of students in the middle school is 840.

Answer: 840
