Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 200 apples in the orchard.
2) 40% of the 200 apples are rotten.
3) To calculate the number of rotten apples, we take 40% of 200:
   * 40% of 200 = 0.40 * 200 = 80 rotten apples.
4) 70% of the 80 rotten apples smelled.
5) To calculate the number of rotten apples that smelled, we take 70% of 80:
   * 70% of 80 = 0.70 * 80 = 56 rotten apples that smelled.
6) To calculate the number of rotten apples that did not smell, we take the total number of rotten apples (80) and subtract the number of rotten apples that smelled (56):
   * 80 - 56 = 24 rotten apples that did not smell.
