Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry was in the pool for 3 minutes
* Elaine stayed in the pool for twice as long as Jerry, which means she was in the pool for 2 x 3 = 6 minutes
* George could only stay in the pool for one-third as long as Elaine, which means he was in the pool for 6 / 3 = 2 minutes
* Kramer could not find the pool, so he was not in the pool at all

Now, to find the combined total of minutes that Jerry and his friends were in the cold water, we add up the individual times:
* Jerry: 3 minutes
* Elaine: 6 minutes
* George: 2 minutes
* Kramer: 0 minutes

Adding these up, we get:
3 + 6 + 2 + 0 = 11 minutes

Answer: 11
