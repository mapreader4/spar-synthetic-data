Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are four times as many boys as girls at the party. This means that if there are 40 boys, then there must be 10 girls (40 / 4 = 10).
2) Each boy paid $50 to attend the party.
3) Each girl paid half of what each boy paid, which is $25 (since each boy paid $50, and each girl paid half of that).
4) To calculate the total amount of money collected at the party, we need to add up the money paid by the boys and the money paid by the girls.
5) The total money paid by the boys is 40 boys x $50 per boy = $2,000.
6) The total money paid by the girls is 10 girls x $25 per girl = $250.
7) The total amount of money collected at the party is the sum of the money paid by the boys and the money paid by the girls, which is $2,000 + $250 = $2,250.

Answer: $2,250
