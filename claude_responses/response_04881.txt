Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Snap, Crackle, and Pop spend a total of $150 on cereal
* Snap spends twice as much as Crackle
* Crackle spends 3 times as much as Pop

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the amount Pop spent
* Then Crackle spent 3x
* And Snap spent 2 * 3x = 6x

We know that the total spent is $150, so we can set up an equation:
* x + 3x + 6x = 150
* 10x = 150
* x = 15

Therefore, Pop spent $15 on cereal.

Answer: 15
