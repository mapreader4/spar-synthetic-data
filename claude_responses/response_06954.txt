Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Martin eats 1/2 cup of berries every day
* The grocery store is selling a package of berries (1 cup per pack) for $2.00
* We need to find how much he will spend on berries in a 30 day period

First, we need to calculate how many cups of berries he will eat in 30 days:
* 1/2 cup per day x 30 days = 15 cups of berries

Next, we need to calculate how many packages of berries he will need to buy:
* 15 cups of berries / 1 cup per package = 15 packages

Finally, we can calculate the total cost:
* 15 packages x $2.00 per package = $30.00

Answer: $30
