Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jean has 3 grandchildren
* She buys each grandkid 2 cards a year
* She puts $80 in each card

To calculate the total amount she gives away to her grandchildren a year, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of cards she buys per year
2. Multiply the total number of cards by the amount she puts in each card

Step 1: Total number of cards per year
* 3 grandchildren x 2 cards per grandchild = 6 cards per year

Step 2: Total amount given away per year
* 6 cards per year x $80 per card = $480 per year

Answer: $480
