Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The original tax rate was 20%.
2) The new tax rate is 30%.
3) John's original income was $1,000,000 per year.
4) John's new income is $1,500,000 per year.

To calculate the original tax amount:
* 20% of $1,000,000 = $200,000

To calculate the new tax amount:
* 30% of $1,500,000 = $450,000

To calculate the difference in taxes:
* $450,000 - $200,000 = $250,000

Answer: $250,000
