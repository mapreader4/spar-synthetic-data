Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The vendor is selling sunglasses for $30 each.
2) He sells 10 pairs of sunglasses in a day.
3) The total revenue from selling 10 pairs of sunglasses at $30 each is: 10 x $30 = $300.
4) The vendor then takes half of his profits and uses it to buy a new sign, which costs $20.
5) The profits are the total revenue minus the cost of buying the sunglasses. So the profits are $300 - the cost of buying the sunglasses.
6) Half of the profits are used to buy the $20 sign, so the other half of the profits are the amount the vendor spent to buy the sunglasses.
7) Let's call the cost of buying each pair of sunglasses 'x'.
8) The total cost of buying the 10 pairs of sunglasses is 10x.
9) The profits are $300 - 10x.
10) Half of the profits, which is used to buy the $20 sign, is ($300 - 10x)/2 = $20.
11) Solving this equation, we get: $300 - 10x = $40, so 10x = $260, and x = $26.

Answer: $26
