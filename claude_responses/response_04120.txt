Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bridget counted 14 shooting stars.
2) Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so Reginald counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars.
3) Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so Sam counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars.
4) The average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 42 / 3 = 14.
5) Sam counted 16 shooting stars, which is 16 - 14 = 2 more than the average.
