Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. There are 6 homeless shelters that Mark donates soup to.
2. Each homeless shelter services 30 people.
3. Mark decides to buy 10 cans of soup per person.
4. To calculate the total number of cans of soup donated, we need to:
   a. Multiply the number of people serviced per shelter (30) by the number of shelters (6) to get the total number of people serviced.
   b. Multiply the total number of people serviced by the number of cans of soup per person (10).
5. Calculation:
   a. Total number of people serviced = 30 people per shelter x 6 shelters = 180 people
   b. Total number of cans of soup donated = 180 people x 10 cans per person = 1,800 cans of soup

Answer: 1,800
