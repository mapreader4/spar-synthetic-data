Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, Carla had 2000 cans of food
* On the first day, 500 people took 1 can each, so Carla gave away 500 cans
* After the first day, Carla restocked with 1500 more cans, so she now has 2000 + 1500 = 3500 cans
* On the second day, 1000 people took 2 cans each, so Carla gave away 1000 * 2 = 2000 cans
* Carla then restocked with 3000 more cans

To calculate the total number of cans Carla gave away, we add the cans given away on the first day (500) and the second day (2000):
* Total cans given away = 500 + 2000 = 2500

Answer: 2500
