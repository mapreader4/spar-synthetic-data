Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Myrtle has 3 hens that lay 3 eggs a day
* In 7 days, the hens would lay 3 eggs x 3 hens x 7 days = 63 eggs
* The neighbor took 12 eggs from the 63 eggs
* So the remaining eggs would be 63 - 12 = 51 eggs
* On the way into the house, Myrtle dropped 5 eggs
* So the final number of eggs Myrtle has is 51 - 5 = 46 eggs

Answer: 46 eggs
