Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Wednesday morning, Suzy had 98 books ready for checkout.
* On Wednesday, 43 books were checked out, so the number of books Suzy had decreased by 43.
* 98 - 43 = 55 books remaining.
* On Thursday, 23 books were returned, so the number of books Suzy had increased by 23.
* 55 + 23 = 78 books.
* On Thursday, 5 books were checked out, so the number of books Suzy had decreased by 5.
* 78 - 5 = 73 books.
* On Friday, 7 books were returned, so the number of books Suzy had increased by 7.
* 73 + 7 = 80 books.

Answer: 80 books.
