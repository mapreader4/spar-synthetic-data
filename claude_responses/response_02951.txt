Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Anna sold 36 glasses of plain lemonade for $0.75 each.
   * To calculate the total amount she made from plain lemonade, we multiply the number of glasses sold (36) by the price per glass ($0.75).
   * 36 glasses x $0.75 per glass = $27 total from plain lemonade.

2. Anna made $16 total from selling strawberry lemonade.

3. To find how much more she made from plain lemonade than strawberry lemonade, we subtract the amount made from strawberry lemonade ($16) from the amount made from plain lemonade ($27).
   * $27 - $16 = $11

Therefore, Anna made $11 more from plain lemonade than strawberry lemonade.
