Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mark deposited $88 in the bank.
2) Bryan deposited $40 less than five times as much as Mark.
3) To find how much Bryan deposited, we first need to calculate five times as much as Mark's deposit:
   * 5 x $88 = $440
4) Then, we subtract $40 from $440 to get Bryan's deposit:
   * $440 - $40 = $400
Therefore, Bryan deposited $400 in the bank.

Answer: $88
