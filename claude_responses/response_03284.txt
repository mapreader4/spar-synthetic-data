Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Antonella has 10 Canadian coins in her purse
* The coins are either loonies (worth $1) or toonies (worth $2)
* She bought a Frappuccino that cost $3
* She still has $11 left

To find the number of toonies she initially had, we can set up an equation:
* Let x = the number of toonies she had
* Then the number of loonies she had is 10 - x
* The total value of the coins she had was:
    - x * $2 (for the toonies)
    - (10 - x) * $1 (for the loonies)
    - This total value is $11 (the amount she has left after buying the Frappuccino)
* So the equation is:
    - x * $2 + (10 - x) * $1 = $11 + $3 (the cost of the Frappuccino)
    - 2x + 10 - x = 14
    - x = 4

Answer: 4 toonies.
