Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michaela needs 20 oranges to get full
* Cassandra needs twice as many oranges as Michaela to get full
* Cassandra needs 2 x 20 = 40 oranges to get full
* Together, Michaela and Cassandra need 20 + 40 = 60 oranges to get full
* They picked 90 oranges from the farm today
* To find the number of oranges remaining, we subtract the number of oranges they need to get full from the total number of oranges picked:
* 90 oranges - 60 oranges = 30 oranges

Answer: 30
