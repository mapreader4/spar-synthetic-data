Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total cost of the gift is $100.
2) The boss contributes $15.
3) Todd contributes twice as much as the boss, which is $15 x 2 = $30.
4) The remaining 5 employees (including Nick) need to contribute the remaining amount, which is $100 - $15 - $30 = $55.
5) The remaining $55 needs to be split equally among the 5 employees.
6) $55 / 5 = $11.

Answer: $11
