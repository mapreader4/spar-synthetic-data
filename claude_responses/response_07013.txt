Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The fish tank is leaking at a rate of 1.5 ounces per hour
* Kevin plans to be away for up to 12 hours before returning with a new tank
* The amount of fluid that will leak over 12 hours is:
    - 1.5 ounces per hour x 12 hours = 18 ounces
* The bucket he placed underneath the tank can hold twice the amount of fluid that would leak over 12 hours
* Therefore, the size of the bucket he used is:
    - 2 x 18 ounces = 36 ounces

Answer: 36 ounces
