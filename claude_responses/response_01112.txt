Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of berries picked: 42
* Half of the berries were raspberries
* One-third of the berries were blackberries

First, let's find the number of raspberries:
* Half of 42 berries = 42 / 2 = 21 raspberries

Next, let's find the number of blackberries:
* One-third of 42 berries = 42 / 3 = 14 blackberries

Now, we can find the number of blueberries by subtracting the raspberries and blackberries from the total:
* Total berries - raspberries - blackberries = blueberries
* 42 - 21 - 14 = 7 blueberries

Answer: 7 blueberries.
