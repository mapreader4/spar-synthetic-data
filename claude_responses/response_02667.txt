Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Zachary sold 40 games at $5 each, so Zachary's total earnings are:
   40 games x $5 per game = $200

2. Jason received 30% more money than Zachary, so Jason's total earnings are:
   Zachary's earnings ($200) + 30% of Zachary's earnings = $200 + ($200 x 0.3) = $260

3. Ryan received $50 more than Jason, so Ryan's total earnings are:
   Jason's earnings ($260) + $50 = $310

4. To calculate the total amount of money the three friends received together, we add up their individual earnings:
   Zachary's earnings ($200) + Jason's earnings ($260) + Ryan's earnings ($310) = $770

Answer: $770
