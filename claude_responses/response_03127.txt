Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Fem is currently 11 years old
* Matt is four times as old as Fem
* To find Matt's current age, we can multiply Fem's age by 4:
  * Matt's current age = 4 x 11 = 44 years old
* In two years, Fem will be 11 + 2 = 13 years old
* In two years, Matt will be 44 + 2 = 46 years old
* The sum of their ages in two years will be:
  * Fem's age in two years + Matt's age in two years
  * 13 + 46 = 59

Answer: 59
