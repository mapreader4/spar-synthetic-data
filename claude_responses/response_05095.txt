Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The number of Christmas presents David found was twice as many as the number of birthday presents.
2) We know that David found a total of 60 Christmas presents.
3) Let's call the number of birthday presents 'x'.
4) Since the number of Christmas presents was twice as many as the number of birthday presents, we can say that the number of Christmas presents is 2x.
5) We know the total number of Christmas presents is 60, so we can say that 2x = 60.
6) Solving for x, we get x = 30.
7) So David found 30 birthday presents.
8) The total number of presents David got is the sum of the Christmas presents (60) and the birthday presents (30).
9) Therefore, the total number of presents David got is 60 + 30 = 90.

Answer: 90
