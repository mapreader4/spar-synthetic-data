Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brittany uses 1/4 ounce of shampoo every other day.
2) In a leap year, there are 366 days.
3) Since Brittany washes her hair every other day, she will wash her hair 183 times in a leap year (366 days / 2 days per wash).
4) Each time she washes her hair, she uses 1/4 ounce of shampoo.
5) So in a leap year, she will use 183 * 1/4 = 45.75 ounces of shampoo.
6) The shampoo bottles are 14 ounces each.
7) To calculate how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of shampoo used (45.75 ounces) by the size of each bottle (14 ounces).
8) 45.75 ounces / 14 ounces per bottle = 3.27 bottles.

Answer: 4 bottles
