Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kris has been suspended for bullying many times
* For every instance of bullying, she was suspended for 3 days
* She has been suspended for three times as many days as a typical person has fingers and toes

First, let's determine how many fingers and toes a typical person has:
* A typical person has 10 fingers and 10 toes, for a total of 20 digits

Now, we know that Kris has been suspended for three times as many days as a typical person has fingers and toes, which is:
* 3 x 20 = 60 days

Since she was suspended for 3 days for each instance of bullying, we can divide the total number of days she was suspended (60) by 3 to determine the number of instances of bullying:
* 60 days / 3 days per instance = 20 instances of bullying

Answer: 20
