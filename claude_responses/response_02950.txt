Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The parking area is 4 stories tall
* On the first level, there are 4 open parking spots
* On the second level, there are 7 more open parking spots than on the first level
   - So, the number of open parking spots on the second level is 4 + 7 = 11
* On the third level, there are 6 more open parking spots than on the second level
   - So, the number of open parking spots on the third level is 11 + 6 = 17
* On the fourth level, there are 14 open parking spots

To find the total number of open parking spots, we add up the number of spots on each level:
* 4 + 11 + 17 + 14 = 46

Answer: 46
