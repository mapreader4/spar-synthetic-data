Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexander was 50 inches tall on his 8th birthday
* He grows 1/2 a foot per year
* We need to find his height on his 12th birthday

First, we need to convert the growth rate from feet to inches:
* 1/2 foot = 6 inches

Next, we need to calculate how much he will grow from his 8th birthday to his 12th birthday:
* Growth from 8th to 12th birthday = 4 years x 6 inches/year = 24 inches

Finally, we add the growth to his initial height to get his height on his 12th birthday:
* Height on 12th birthday = 50 inches + 24 inches = 74 inches

Answer: 74 inches
