Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Mary started with 72 mystery books at the beginning of the year.
* She joined a book club that sent her 1 book each month of the year, so that's 12 additional books.
* Halfway through the year, she bought 5 more books at a bookstore.
* Later, she bought 2 more books at yard sales.
* Her daughter gave her 1 book for her birthday.
* Her mother gave her a series of 4 books when Mary visited her.
* She donated 12 books to a charity shop.
* She sold 3 books to a used book store.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books she had at the end of the year:
* Starting books: 72
* Books from book club: 72 + 12 = 84
* Books from bookstore: 84 + 5 = 89
* Books from yard sales: 89 + 2 = 91
* Book from daughter: 91 + 1 = 92
* Books from mother: 92 + 4 = 96
* Books donated: 96 - 12 = 84
* Books sold: 84 - 3 = 81

Answer: 81 books
