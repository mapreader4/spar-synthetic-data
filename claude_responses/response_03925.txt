Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenny spends 10 hours doing research for the project
* She then spends 2 hours writing a proposal
* She has a total of 20 hours to work on the project
* To find the number of hours she has left to write her report, we need to subtract the time spent on research and the proposal from the total time:
* Total time: 20 hours
* Time spent on research: 10 hours
* Time spent on proposal: 2 hours
* Time left for report: 20 hours - 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours

Answer: 8
