Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We start with 349 pieces of candy in the bowl.
2) Talitha took 108 pieces of candy.
3) So, the number of pieces of candy remaining after Talitha took her share is 349 - 108 = 241 pieces.
4) Solomon then took 153 pieces of candy.
5) So, the number of pieces of candy remaining after Solomon took his share is 241 - 153 = 88 pieces.

Answer: 88
