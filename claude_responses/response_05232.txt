Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jill makes the same amount of each scent for every candle.
2) She made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles.
3) She ran out of almond scent after making 10 almond candles.
4) She had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent, and used all her coconut scent up.

Let's start by finding the number of coconut candles she made:
* Since she used all her coconut scent, and had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent, the number of coconut candles is 1.5 times the number of almond candles.
* She made 10 almond candles, so the number of coconut candles is 1.5 * 10 = 15 coconut candles.

Now, we know that she made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles. So the number of lavender candles is 2 * 15 = 30 lavender candles.

Answer: 30 lavender candles.
