Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 episodes in the TV mini series
* Each episode is 50 minutes long
* Erin is watching all 6 episodes in one sitting, one after the other with no breaks

To calculate the total time Erin will spend watching the series, we need to:
1. Calculate the total minutes of the series
2. Convert the total minutes to hours

Step 1: Calculate the total minutes of the series
* 6 episodes x 50 minutes per episode = 300 minutes

Step 2: Convert the total minutes to hours
* 300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Erin will spend 5 hours watching the Pride and Prejudice TV mini series.
