Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The current babysitter charges $16 per hour.
2. Milly hires the babysitter for 6 hours.
3. So the current babysitter's total cost is:
   $16 per hour x 6 hours = $96

4. The new babysitter charges $12 per hour.
5. The new babysitter also charges an extra $3 for each time the kids scream, which is twice per babysitting gig.
6. So the new babysitter's total cost is:
   $12 per hour x 6 hours = $72
   + $3 x 2 times the kids screamed = $6
   Total new babysitter cost = $72 + $6 = $78

7. To calculate how much less the new babysitter will cost:
   Current babysitter cost: $96
   New babysitter cost: $78
   Difference: $96 - $78 = $18

Answer: $18
