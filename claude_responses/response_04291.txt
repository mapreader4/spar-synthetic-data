Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lizzy had $30 initially.
2) She loaned out $15 to her friend.
3) This means Lizzy had $30 - $15 = $15 remaining.
4) Her friend returned the $15 loan, plus an additional 20% interest.
5) The interest on $15 at 20% is 20% of $15, which is $3.
6) So her friend returned $15 + $3 = $18.
7) Lizzy now has the $15 she had remaining, plus the $18 that was returned, for a total of $15 + $18 = $33.
