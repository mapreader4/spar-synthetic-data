Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The train carried 100 passengers from one station to the other on the first trip
* On the return trip, the train carried 60 passengers
* The train made a total of 4 round trips that day (1 round trip initially, plus 3 more)
* Each round trip carried the same number of passengers as the first trip

To calculate the total number of passengers transported, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of passengers transported in each round trip
2. Multiply the number of passengers per round trip by the total number of round trips

Step 1: Number of passengers per round trip
* First trip: 100 passengers one way, 60 passengers return
* Total passengers per round trip = 100 + 60 = 160 passengers

Step 2: Total number of passengers transported
* Number of passengers per round trip = 160
* Total number of round trips = 4
* Total passengers transported = 160 * 4 = 640 passengers

Answer: 640
