Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gina collected 2 bags of litter by herself.
2) The rest of the neighborhood collected 82 times as much as Gina did by herself.
3) Each bag of litter weighs 4 pounds.
4) To calculate the total amount of litter collected, we need to first find out how much Gina collected by herself, and then add that to the amount collected by the rest of the neighborhood.
5) Gina collected 2 bags, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 pounds.
6) The rest of the neighborhood collected 82 times as much, so that's 82 x 8 = 656 pounds.
7) The total amount of litter collected is 8 + 656 = 664 pounds.

Answer: 664
