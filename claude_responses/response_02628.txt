Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John got $50 from each of his 4 grandparents, so the total amount of money he got is:
   4 grandparents x $50 per grandparent = $200
2) Each bird costs $20, so with the $200 he has, he can buy:
   $200 / $20 per bird = 10 birds
3) Each bird has 2 wings, so the total number of wings for all the birds is:
   10 birds x 2 wings per bird = 20 wings

Answer: 20
