Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jean has three times as much money as Jane
* Let's say Jane has x dollars
* Then, Jean has 3x dollars
* The total amount of money they have is $76
* So, we can write the equation: x + 3x = 76
* Solving for x, we get: 4x = 76
* Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 19
* Therefore, Jane has $19
* Since Jean has three times as much money as Jane, Jean has 3 * $19 = $57

Answer: $57
