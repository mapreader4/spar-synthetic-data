Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The area of the forest is three times the area of the square-shaped street.
2) The street has a length of 100 meters on one side.
3) The area of a square is given by the formula: Area = side length x side length.
4) So the area of the street is: 100 m x 100 m = 10,000 square meters.
5) Since the area of the forest is three times the area of the street, the area of the forest is: 3 x 10,000 square meters = 30,000 square meters.
6) The number of trees per square meter in the forest is 4.
7) To calculate the total number of trees in the forest, we multiply the area of the forest by the number of trees per square meter: 30,000 square meters x 4 trees/square meter = 120,000 trees.

Answer: 120,000
