Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lorenzo started with 3 full cans of thumbtacks
* He placed 1 thumbtack from each of the 3 cans into every board tested
* He tested 120 boards
* At the end of the day, he had 30 tacks remaining in each of the 3 cans

To find the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of thumbtacks used during the testing
2. Add the number of thumbtacks remaining in the 3 cans

Step 1: Calculating the number of thumbtacks used during the testing
* Each board received 3 thumbtacks (1 from each of the 3 cans)
* 120 boards were tested
* So the total number of thumbtacks used = 120 boards x 3 thumbtacks per board = 360 thumbtacks

Step 2: Adding the number of thumbtacks remaining in the 3 cans
* Each can had 30 thumbtacks remaining
* So the total number of thumbtacks remaining = 3 cans x 30 thumbtacks per can = 90 thumbtacks

Therefore, the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans is:
Total thumbtacks used + Total thumbtacks remaining = 360 + 90 = 450 thumbtacks

Answer: 450
