Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim sleeps 6 hours per day for 5 days a week
* So for those 5 days, he sleeps 6 hours x 5 days = 30 hours
* He also sleeps 10 hours per day for the other 2 days of the week
* So for those 2 days, he sleeps 10 hours x 2 days = 20 hours
* To calculate the total sleep, we add the hours from the two different sleep schedules:
* 30 hours + 20 hours = 50 hours

Answer: 50
