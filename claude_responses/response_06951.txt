Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first floor of the building contains twice as much floor space for storage as the second floor.
2) Bubba put several thousand boxes on the second floor, which filled one-quarter of the second floor storage space.
3) The boxes used up 5,000 square feet of storage space.

To find the total storage space available in the building, we need to first find the storage space on each floor.

The second floor storage space is 5,000 square feet, which is one-quarter of the total second floor storage space. Therefore, the total second floor storage space is 4 * 5,000 = 20,000 square feet.

Since the first floor has twice the storage space of the second floor, the first floor storage space is 2 * 20,000 = 40,000 square feet.

The total storage space in the building is the sum of the first and second floor storage spaces, which is 40,000 + 20,000 = 60,000 square feet.

The amount of storage space still available in the building is the total storage space minus the space used by the boxes, which is 60,000 - 5,000 = 55,000 square feet.

Answer: 55,000 square feet.
