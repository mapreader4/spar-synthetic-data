Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Greta worked 40 hours and was paid $12 per hour.
2) To calculate Greta's total earnings, we multiply the number of hours worked (40) by the hourly rate ($12):
   40 hours x $12 per hour = $480
3) Lisa earns $15 per hour.
4) To find how many hours Lisa would need to work to equal Greta's earnings of $480, we divide Greta's total earnings ($480) by Lisa's hourly rate ($15 per hour):
   $480 / $15 per hour = 32 hours

Answer: 32 hours
