Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Uki sells cupcakes at $1.50 each, and she can bake an average of 20 cupcakes per day.
2) So, the daily revenue from cupcakes is 20 cupcakes x $1.50 per cupcake = $30.
3) Uki sells cookies at $2 per packet, and she can bake an average of 10 packets of cookies per day.
4) So, the daily revenue from cookies is 10 packets x $2 per packet = $20.
5) Uki sells biscuits at $1 per packet, and she can bake an average of 20 packets of biscuits per day.
6) So, the daily revenue from biscuits is 20 packets x $1 per packet = $20.
7) The total daily revenue is the sum of the revenue from cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits: $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.
8) For five days, the total earnings would be 5 days x $70 per day = $350.
