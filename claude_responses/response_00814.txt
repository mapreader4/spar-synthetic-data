Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sean buys 1 almond croissant and 1 salami and cheese croissant, each costing $4.50, so that's 2 * $4.50 = $9.00
* He also buys 1 plain croissant for $3.00
* And 1 loaf of focaccia for $4.00
* So the total for the food items is $9.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $16.00
* On his way home, he buys 2 lattes for $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
* Adding up the total for the food items ($16.00) and the lattes ($5.00), the total amount Sean spent is:
Answer: $21
