Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The train travels 360 miles in 3 hours
* This means the train's speed is 360 miles / 3 hours = 120 miles per hour
* We want to know how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 240 miles
* To calculate this, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed
* So, the additional time required would be: 240 miles / 120 miles per hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
