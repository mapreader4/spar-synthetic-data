Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Zayne sells bracelets for $5 each and two for $8.
2) He started with 30 bracelets.
3) He made $60 from selling bracelets for $5 each.
4) To calculate the total amount he made, we need to find out how many bracelets he sold for $5 each and how many he sold for $8 (two for $8).
5) We know he made $60 from selling bracelets for $5 each, so he must have sold 12 bracelets at $5 each (60 / 5 = 12).
6) That means he had 18 bracelets left (30 - 12 = 18).
7) He could have sold 9 sets of 2 bracelets for $8 each (18 / 2 = 9).
8) So the total amount he made is $60 (from selling 12 bracelets at $5 each) + $72 (from selling 9 sets of 2 bracelets for $8 each) = $132.

Answer: 132
