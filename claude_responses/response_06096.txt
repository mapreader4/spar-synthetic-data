Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The original steak was 30 ounces
* Half of the steak was burned, so the remaining unburned portion is 30 ounces / 2 = 15 ounces
* John eats 80% of the 15 ounces that wasn't burned
* To calculate 80% of 15 ounces, we multiply 15 by 0.8 (80% expressed as a decimal)
* 15 ounces * 0.8 = 12 ounces

Therefore, the amount of steak that John ate is 12 ounces.

Answer: 12
