Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* For the first showing, 200 people bought tickets
* For the second showing, three times as many people showed up, which is 3 * 200 = 600 people
* Each ticket cost $25
* To calculate the total revenue, we need to add the revenue from the first and second showings:
* Revenue from first showing: 200 tickets * $25 per ticket = $5,000
* Revenue from second showing: 600 tickets * $25 per ticket = $15,000
* Total revenue = $5,000 + $15,000 = $20,000

Answer: 20000
