Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, the choir had a mixture of 80 blonde and black-haired girls.
2) The teacher added 10 more blonde-haired girls to the choir.
3) So, the total number of blonde-haired girls in the choir is now 30 + 10 = 40.
4) We know the total number of girls in the choir is 80 + 10 = 90.
5) To find the number of black-haired girls, we can subtract the number of blonde-haired girls from the total number of girls:
90 - 40 = 50
Therefore, the number of black-haired girls present in the choir is 50.

Answer: 50
