Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Jenna's eel is 1/3 as long as Bill's eel.
2) We also know that the combined length of their eels is 64 inches.
3) Let's call the length of Bill's eel "x".
4) Since Jenna's eel is 1/3 as long as Bill's eel, the length of Jenna's eel is 1/3 * x.
5) The combined length of their eels is 64 inches, so we can write the equation:
   x + 1/3 * x = 64
6) Solving for x, we get:
   4/3 * x = 64
   x = 48
7) Therefore, the length of Jenna's eel is 1/3 * 48 = 16 inches.

Answer: 16
