Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 4,000 jelly beans in the jar.
2) Three fourths of the jelly beans are red. To calculate the number of red jelly beans, we take 3/4 of 4,000:
3/4 * 4,000 = 3,000 red jelly beans.
3) One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. To calculate the number of coconut flavored jelly beans, we take 1/4 of the 3,000 red jelly beans:
1/4 * 3,000 = 750 coconut flavored jelly beans.

Answer: 750
