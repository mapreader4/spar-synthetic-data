Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kate is currently 29 years old
* Three years from now, Tully will be twice as old as Kate
* This means that three years from now, Tully's age will be 2 x (Kate's age + 3)
* So, three years from now, Tully's age will be 2 x (29 + 3) = 2 x 32 = 64
* Therefore, Tully's current age is 64 - 3 = 61
* A year ago, Tully was 61 - 1 = 60 years old

Answer: 60
