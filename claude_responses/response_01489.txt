Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Seth lost 17.5 pounds.
2) Jerome lost three times as many pounds as Seth, which is 3 * 17.5 = 52.5 pounds.
3) Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth, which is 17.5 + 1.5 = 19 pounds.
4) To find the total pounds lost by the 3 people, we add up the individual amounts:
   Seth: 17.5 pounds
   Jerome: 52.5 pounds
   Veronica: 19 pounds
   Total: 17.5 + 52.5 + 19 = 89 pounds.

Answer: 89 pounds.
