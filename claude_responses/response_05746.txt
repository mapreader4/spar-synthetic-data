Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 12 archeology students
* Each student ticket costs $1
* So the total cost for the student tickets is 12 * $1 = $12
* There are 4 teachers
* Each adult ticket costs $3
* So the total cost for the adult tickets is 4 * $3 = $12
* To find the total cost of all the tickets, we add the cost of the student tickets and the adult tickets:
* $12 + $12 = $24
* Answer: $24
