Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Let the original number be x.
2) Doubling the number and adding 5 gives us 2x + 5.
3) The problem states that 2x + 5 is 20 more than half of the original number.
4) Half of the original number is x/2.
5) So we have the equation: 2x + 5 = x/2 + 20.
6) Solving for x, we get:
2x + 5 = x/2 + 20
2x + 5 - 20 = x/2
2x - 15 = x/2
3x/2 = 15
x = 10.

Answer: 10.
