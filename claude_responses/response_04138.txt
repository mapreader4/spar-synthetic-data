Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Agatha spent $15 on the frame
* She then spent $25 on the front wheel
* After these two purchases, she has $20 left to spend on a seat and handlebar tape
* To find the total amount of money she had at first, we need to add up the amounts she spent and the amount she has left:
* $15 (frame) + $25 (front wheel) + $20 (remaining) = $60
* Therefore, the total amount of money Agatha had at first was $60.

Answer: $60
