Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Paolo has 14 coconuts.
2) Dante has thrice as many coconuts as Paolo. That means Dante has 3 x 14 = 42 coconuts.
3) Dante then sold 10 of his coconuts.
4) To find how many coconuts Dante has left, we take the original number of coconuts (42) and subtract the number of coconuts he sold (10).
5) 42 - 10 = 32 coconuts.

Answer: 32
