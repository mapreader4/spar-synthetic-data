Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total number of years in a century is 100.
2) Gideon has the same number of marbles as the number of years in a century, which is 100.
3) Gideon gives 3/4 of his 100 marbles to his sister. That means he gives away 75 marbles, and has 25 marbles remaining.
4) Gideon then multiplies the number of remaining marbles (25) by 2, which gives him 50 marbles.
5) The number of marbles Gideon has after these operations is his age five years from now.
6) Therefore, Gideon's age five years from now is 50.
7) Subtracting 5 from 50, we get Gideon's current age, which is 45.

Answer: 45
