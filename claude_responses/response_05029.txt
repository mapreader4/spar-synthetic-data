Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maria wants to buy 6 sweaters at $30 each
* So the total cost of the sweaters is 6 x $30 = $180
* Maria also wants to buy 6 scarves at $20 each
* So the total cost of the scarves is 6 x $20 = $120
* The total cost of all the items is $180 + $120 = $300
* Maria has saved $500
* To calculate how much will be left in her savings, we take the amount she has saved ($500) and subtract the total cost of the items ($300)
* $500 - $300 = $200

Answer: $200
