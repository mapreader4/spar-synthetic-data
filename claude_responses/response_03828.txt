Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of guests: 50
* Half of the guests are women, so the number of women is 50 / 2 = 25
* The number of men is 15
* The number of children is 50 - 25 - 15 = 10
* In the middle of the movie, 1/5 of the men and 4 children left
* The number of men who left is 1/5 of 15 = 3
* The number of children who left is 4
* The number of people who stayed is:
    - Women: 25
    - Men: 15 - 3 = 12
    - Children: 10 - 4 = 6
* Total number of people who stayed: 25 + 12 + 6 = 43

Answer: 43
