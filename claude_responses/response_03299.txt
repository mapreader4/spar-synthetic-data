Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each short-answer question takes 3 minutes to answer
* Each paragraph takes 15 minutes to write
* Each essay takes an hour (60 minutes) to write
* Karen assigns 2 essays and 5 paragraphs
* The total time for the essays is:
  - 2 essays x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
* The total time for the paragraphs is:
  - 5 paragraphs x 15 minutes = 75 minutes
* The total time for the essays and paragraphs is:
  - 120 minutes + 75 minutes = 195 minutes
* Karen wants to assign 4 hours of homework total
* 4 hours = 240 minutes
* The remaining time for short-answer questions is:
  - 240 minutes - 195 minutes = 45 minutes
* Each short-answer question takes 3 minutes
* Therefore, the number of short-answer questions should be:
  - 45 minutes / 3 minutes per question = 15 questions

Answer: 15
