Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Francis' family has 2 ukuleles, each with 4 strings, so the total number of strings for the ukuleles is 2 * 4 = 8 strings.
* Francis' family has 4 guitars, each with 6 strings, so the total number of strings for the guitars is 4 * 6 = 24 strings.
* The total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins is 40 strings.
* We can calculate the number of strings for the violins by subtracting the number of strings for the ukuleles and guitars from the total number of strings:
* 40 strings - 8 strings (ukuleles) - 24 strings (guitars) = 8 strings for the violins.
* Since each violin has 4 strings, the number of violins is 8 strings / 4 strings per violin = 2 violins.
