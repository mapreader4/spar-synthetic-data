Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jose charges $3 for kids
* Jose charges twice the amount for adults, which is $6 per adult
* There are 8 kids and 10 adults swimming in his pool per day
* To calculate the daily earnings:
    - 8 kids x $3 = $24 from kids
    - 10 adults x $6 = $60 from adults
    - Total daily earnings = $24 + $60 = $84
* To calculate the weekly earnings:
    - There are 7 days in a week
    - $84 per day x 7 days = $588 per week

Answer: 588
