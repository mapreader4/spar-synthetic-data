Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 10 rows of roses
* In each row, there are 20 roses
* 1/2 of the 20 roses in each row are red
* So, 1/2 of 20 = 10 red roses per row
* That leaves 20 - 10 = 10 non-red roses per row
* 3/5 of the 10 non-red roses per row are white
* 3/5 of 10 = 6 white roses per row
* That leaves 10 - 6 = 4 pink roses per row
* Since there are 10 rows, the total number of pink roses is:
* 4 pink roses per row x 10 rows = 40 pink roses

Answer: 40
