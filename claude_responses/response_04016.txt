Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Mary thinks there are 60 animals in the petting zoo
* She double-counted 7 sheep, which means she counted 7 more sheep than there actually were
* She forgot to count 3 pigs, which means there are 3 more pigs than she counted
* So, the actual number of animals is:
    - The number of animals Mary counted (60)
    - The 7 extra sheep she double-counted
    + The 3 pigs she forgot to count
* Therefore, the actual number of animals is:
    60 - 7 + 3 = 56

Answer: 56
