Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Devin is 12 years old
* Eden is twice as old as Devin, so Eden is 2 * 12 = 24 years old
* Eden's mom is twice as old as Eden, so Eden's mom is 2 * 24 = 48 years old

Now, to find the average age of the three:
* The total age of the three is Devin's age (12) + Eden's age (24) + Eden's mom's age (48) = 84 years
* The average age is the total age divided by the number of people, which is 3
* Average age = 84 / 3 = 28 years

Answer: 28
