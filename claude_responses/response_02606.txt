Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 35 students in the class
* There are 4 adult chaperones
* The entrance fee for students is $5 per student
* The entrance fee for adults is $6 per adult

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost for the students:
   * 35 students x $5 per student = $175
2. Calculate the cost for the adults:
   * 4 adults x $6 per adult = $24
3. Add the costs for the students and adults together:
   * $175 + $24 = $199

Answer: $199
