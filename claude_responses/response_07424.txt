Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bulk price of honey is $5 per pound
* The minimum spend before tax is $40
* The honey is taxed at $1 per pound
* Penny has paid $240 for honey

First, we need to calculate the total cost of Penny's purchase, including the tax:
* Total cost = $240

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the honey before tax:
* Cost of honey before tax = Total cost - Tax
* Tax = $1 per pound
* Cost of honey before tax = $240 - (Total pounds * $1)

Now, we can solve for the total pounds of honey Penny purchased:
* Cost of honey before tax = $5 per pound * Total pounds
* $240 - (Total pounds * $1) = $5 * Total pounds
* $240 - Total pounds = $5 * Total pounds
* $240 = $6 * Total pounds
* Total pounds = $240 / $6
* Total pounds = 40

Finally, we can calculate how many pounds Penny's purchase exceeded the minimum spend:
* Minimum spend before tax = $40
* Minimum spend in pounds = $40 / $5 = 8 pounds
* Penny's purchase exceeded the minimum spend by 40 - 8 = 32 pounds

Answer: 32 pounds
