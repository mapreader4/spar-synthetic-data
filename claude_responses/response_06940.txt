Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The television program is 30 minutes long
* One-fourth of the airing time is spent on commercials
* This means that 1/4 of the 30-minute program is spent on commercials, which is 7.5 minutes (30 minutes x 1/4 = 7.5 minutes)
* There are 6 thirty-minute programs
* To find the total time spent on commercials for all 6 programs, we multiply the time spent on commercials for one program (7.5 minutes) by the number of programs (6)
* 7.5 minutes x 6 programs = 45 minutes

Answer: 45 minutes
