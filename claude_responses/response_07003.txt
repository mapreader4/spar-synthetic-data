Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Julia bought 3 packs of red balls
* Each pack of red balls has 19 balls
* So the total number of red balls is 3 * 19 = 57 red balls

* Julia bought 10 packs of yellow balls
* Each pack of yellow balls has 19 balls
* So the total number of yellow balls is 10 * 19 = 190 yellow balls

* Julia bought 8 packs of green balls
* Each pack of green balls has 19 balls
* So the total number of green balls is 8 * 19 = 152 green balls

* To find the total number of balls Julia bought, we add up the red, yellow, and green balls:
* 57 red balls + 190 yellow balls + 152 green balls = 399 balls

Answer: 399
