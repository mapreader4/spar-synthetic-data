Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dr. Jones earns $6,000 a month
* His house rental is $640 each month
* His monthly food expense is $380
* His electric and water bill costs 1/4 of what he makes
* His insurances cost 1/5 of what he makes

First, let's calculate the cost of his electric and water bill:
* 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500

Next, let's calculate the cost of his insurances:
* 1/5 of $6,000 = $1,200

Now, let's add up all his monthly expenses:
* House rental: $640
* Food expense: $380
* Electric and water bill: $1,500
* Insurances: $1,200
* Total expenses: $640 + $380 + $1,500 + $1,200 = $3,720

Finally, let's calculate how much money he has left after paying those four bills:
* Dr. Jones earns $6,000 a month
* His total expenses are $3,720
* $6,000 - $3,720 = $2,280

Answer: $2,280
