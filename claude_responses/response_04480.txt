To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of cleaner that ran through the pipe during the three different time periods.

First 15 minutes:
* 2 ounces per minute for 15 minutes
* 2 ounces x 15 minutes = 30 ounces

Next 10 minutes:
* 3 ounces per minute for 10 minutes
* 3 ounces x 10 minutes = 30 ounces

Final 5 minutes:
* 4 ounces per minute for 5 minutes
* 4 ounces x 5 minutes = 20 ounces

Total amount of cleaner used after 30 minutes:
* 30 ounces + 30 ounces + 20 ounces = 80 ounces

Answer: 80 ounces
