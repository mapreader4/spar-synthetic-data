Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rex wants to take 40 hour-long lessons before his test
* He decides to have two-hour sessions twice a week
* That means each week he takes 4 hours of lessons (2 hours x 2 sessions)
* After 6 weeks, he has taken 6 x 4 = 24 hours of lessons
* He still needs to take 40 - 24 = 16 more hours of lessons
* Since he takes 4 hours of lessons per week, he needs 16 / 4 = 4 more weeks to reach his goal of 40 hours
