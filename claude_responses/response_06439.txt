Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Geli starts with 10 push-ups on the first day
* Her fitness trainer encourages her to add 5 more push-ups each day
* We need to find the total number of push-ups she will do in her first week

Day 1: 10 push-ups
Day 2: 10 + 5 = 15 push-ups
Day 3: 15 + 5 = 20 push-ups

Now, let's add up the total number of push-ups for the first week:
* Day 1: 10 push-ups
* Day 2: 15 push-ups
* Day 3: 20 push-ups
* Total = 10 + 15 + 20 = 45 push-ups

Answer: 45
