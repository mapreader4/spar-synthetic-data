Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pablo's mother pays him 1 cent for every page he reads
* Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages
* After reading his books, he bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover

To find the number of books Pablo read, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from reading the books.

We know that:
* He spent $15 on candy
* He had $3 leftover

So, the total amount of money he earned must have been $15 + $3 = $18.

Since Pablo's mother pays him 1 cent per page, and each book is 150 pages, we can calculate the number of books he read by dividing the total amount of money he earned ($18) by the amount he earns per book (150 cents).

$18 / 150 cents per book = 0.12 books

Since we can't have a fractional number of books, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 1 book
