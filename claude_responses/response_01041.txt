Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The clinic administered the covid vaccine to 650 people in total.
* 80% of the people were adults.
* To find the number of children, we need to find the remaining percentage that were not adults.
* 100% - 80% = 20% of the people were children.
* To find the number of children, we take 20% of the total 650 people:
* 20% of 650 = 0.20 * 650 = 130 children.

Answer: 130
