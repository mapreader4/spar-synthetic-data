Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nathan has 14 blankets in his closet
* He added half of the 14 blankets to his bed
* Each blanket warms him up by 3 degrees

To find the total number of degrees he was warmed up, we need to:
1. Calculate how many blankets he added to his bed
* Half of 14 blankets is 7 blankets
2. Multiply the number of blankets by the degree of warmth per blanket
* 7 blankets x 3 degrees per blanket = 21 degrees

Therefore, the blankets warmed Nathan up by 21 degrees.

Answer: 21
