Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Maggie saw 100 goldfish in the aquarium.
2. She was allowed to take home half of the goldfish, which means she was allowed to take home 50 goldfish (100 / 2 = 50).
3. While using the catching net, she caught 3/5 of the 50 goldfish she was allowed to take home.
4. To calculate how many goldfish she caught, we multiply 50 by 3/5: 50 * 3/5 = 30 goldfish.
5. Now, to find out how many goldfish she still needs to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home, we subtract the number of goldfish she caught (30) from the total number she was allowed to take home (50): 50 - 30 = 20 goldfish.

Answer: 20
