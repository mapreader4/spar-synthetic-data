Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Let's define the variables:
  - Let x = the number of quarters
  - Let y = the number of dimes
  - Let z = the number of nickels
* We know that:
  - y = x + 3 (John has 3 more dimes than quarters)
  - z = x - 6 (John has 6 fewer nickels than quarters)
* We also know that the total number of coins is 63:
  - x + y + z = 63
* Substituting the expressions for y and z, we get:
  - x + (x + 3) + (x - 6) = 63
  - 3x - 3 = 63
  - 3x = 66
  - x = 22
* Therefore, John has 22 quarters.

Answer: 22
