Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James drives 30 mph for half an hour
* So, in the first half hour, he drives:
    - 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles
* Then, he drives twice as long (1 hour) at twice the speed (60 mph)
* So, in the second hour, he drives:
    - 60 mph x 1 hour = 60 miles
* To find the total distance he drove, we add the distances from the two segments:
    - 15 miles + 60 miles = 75 miles

Answer: 75
