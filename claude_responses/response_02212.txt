Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first half of the season has 22 episodes
* Each episode in the first half costs $1000
* The total cost for the first half of the season is:
    - 22 episodes x $1000 per episode = $22,000
* The second half of the season also has 22 episodes
* Each episode in the second half costs 120% more than the first half, which means each episode costs $1000 x 2.2 = $2,200
* The total cost for the second half of the season is:
    - 22 episodes x $2,200 per episode = $48,400
* The total cost for the entire season is the sum of the first half and the second half:
    - $22,000 + $48,400 = $70,400

Answer: 70,400
