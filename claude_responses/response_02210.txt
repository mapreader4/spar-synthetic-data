Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The utensils come in 30 packs, with an equal number of knives, forks, and spoons in each pack.
2) John wants 50 spoons.
3) Since each pack has an equal number of knives, forks, and spoons, and John wants 50 spoons, he will need 50 knives and 50 forks as well.
4) The number of utensils in each pack is 30 (10 knives, 10 forks, 10 spoons).
5) To get 50 spoons, John will need 5 packs (50 spoons / 10 spoons per pack = 5 packs).
