Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total oranges picked = 107
* Del picked 23 oranges on each of 2 days
* So, Del picked a total of 23 x 2 = 46 oranges
* Juan picked the remaining oranges
* To find the number of oranges Juan picked, we subtract the number of oranges Del picked from the total oranges picked:
* Oranges picked by Juan = Total oranges - Oranges picked by Del
* Oranges picked by Juan = 107 - 46 = 61

Answer: 61
