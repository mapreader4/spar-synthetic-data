Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shelly has 10 $10 bills
* Each $10 bill is worth $10
* So, the total value of the $10 bills is:
  * 10 bills x $10 per bill = $100
* Shelly has 4 fewer $5 bills than $10 bills
* Since Shelly has 10 $10 bills, she has 6 $5 bills (10 - 4 = 6)
* Each $5 bill is worth $5
* So, the total value of the $5 bills is:
  * 6 bills x $5 per bill = $30
* To find the total money Shelly has, we add the values of the $10 bills and $5 bills:
  * $100 + $30 = $130

Answer: 130
