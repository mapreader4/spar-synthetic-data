Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emily makes $1,000,000 per year
* She has 10 employees who each make $20,000 per year
* The total salary for the 10 employees is 10 * $20,000 = $200,000 per year
* Emily wants to ensure that each employee makes $35,000 per year
* The new total salary for the 10 employees would be 10 * $35,000 = $350,000 per year
* The difference between the new total salary and the old total salary is $350,000 - $200,000 = $150,000
* This means that Emily would need to take $150,000 from her own salary to ensure her employees make $35,000 per year
* Therefore, Emily's new salary would be $1,000,000 - $150,000 = $850,000 per year.
