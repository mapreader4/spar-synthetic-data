Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 32 students in the statistics course.
2) 25% of the class received an A.
   * 25% of 32 = 0.25 * 32 = 8 students received an A.
3) The remaining students are 32 - 8 = 24 students.
4) 1/4 of the remaining 24 students got either a B or C.
   * 1/4 of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students got a B or C.
5) The rest of the students failed.
   * The remaining students are 24 - 6 = 18 students.

Answer: 18 students failed.
