Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The school has a total of 300 students.
2) 2/3 of the population are females, so the number of females is 2/3 * 300 = 200.
3) The number of males is the remaining 1/3 of the population, which is 1/3 * 300 = 100.
4) One-tenth of the males are foreign students, so the number of foreign male students is 1/10 * 100 = 10.
5) The number of non-foreign male students is the total number of males minus the number of foreign male students, which is 100 - 10 = 90.

Answer: 90
