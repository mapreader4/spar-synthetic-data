Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Nathaniel starts with 11 tickets
* He gives away 2 tickets each to his best friends
* He continues doing this until he only has 3 tickets left
* So, the number of tickets he gives away is 11 - 3 = 8
* Since he gives away 2 tickets to each best friend, the number of best friends he has is 8 / 2 = 4
