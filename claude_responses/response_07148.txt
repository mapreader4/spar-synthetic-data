Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Initially, the fish tank had a total of 280 fish
* Over the next 3 weeks, the school added 2 koi fish and 5 goldfish per day
* At the end of the three weeks, the tank had 200 goldfish

First, let's calculate the number of goldfish added over the 3 weeks:
* 5 goldfish per day x 7 days per week x 3 weeks = 105 goldfish added

Now, we can calculate the initial number of goldfish in the tank:
* 200 goldfish at the end + 105 goldfish added = 305 goldfish

Finally, we can calculate the number of koi fish in the tank:
* Total fish initially = 280
* Goldfish at the end = 200
* Koi fish = 280 - 200 = 80

Therefore, the total number of koi fish in the tank after the three weeks is:
Answer: 80
