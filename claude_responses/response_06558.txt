Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes John 20 minutes to go to the bathroom 8 times
* We want to find how long it would take for John to go to the bathroom 6 times
* We can set up a proportion to solve this:
* 8 trips / 20 minutes = 6 trips / x minutes
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 8x = 120
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = 120 / 8
* x = 15 minutes

Answer: 15 minutes
