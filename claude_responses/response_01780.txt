Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Faith is paid $13.50 per hour
* She normally works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week
* That's 8 hours x 5 days = 40 hours per week at her normal rate
* She also works 2 hours of overtime per day
* That's 2 hours x 5 days = 10 hours of overtime per week
* Her normal pay for 40 hours is:
  * 40 hours x $13.50 per hour = $540
* Her overtime pay for 10 hours is:
  * 10 hours x $13.50 per hour x 1.5 (overtime rate) = $202.50
* So her total earnings for the week are:
  * $540 + $202.50 = $742.50

Answer: $742
