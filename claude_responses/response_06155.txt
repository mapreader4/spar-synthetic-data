Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The pickup truck can fill 20 eight-gallon water cans in three hours.
2) Each can is filled three-quarters of its capacity, so each can holds 6 gallons of water (3/4 of 8 gallons).
3) In total, the 20 cans can hold 20 * 6 = 120 gallons of water.
4) Now, if each can is filled to full capacity (8 gallons), the total capacity of the 20 cans would be 20 * 8 = 160 gallons.
5) To find the time it takes to fill 160 gallons, we can use the given information that it takes 3 hours to fill 120 gallons.
6) The rate of filling is 120 gallons / 3 hours = 40 gallons per hour.
7) To fill 160 gallons, it would take 160 gallons / 40 gallons per hour = 4 hours.
8) Now, we need to find how long it would take to fill 25 cans, each with 8 gallons of capacity.
9) The total capacity of 25 cans is 25 * 8 = 200 gallons.
10) At the rate of 40 gallons per hour, it would take 200 gallons / 40 gallons per hour = 5 hours.

Answer: 5 hours
