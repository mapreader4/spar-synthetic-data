Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary needs 1 folder for each of her 6 classes
* So, she needs 6 folders
* Each folder costs $6, so the total cost of the folders is 6 * $6 = $36
* Mary needs 3 pencils for each of her 6 classes
* So, she needs 6 * 3 = 18 pencils
* Each pencil costs $2, so the total cost of the pencils is 18 * $2 = $36
* Mary needs 1 eraser for every 6 pencils
* Since she needs 18 pencils, she needs 18 / 6 = 3 erasers
* Each eraser costs $1, so the total cost of the erasers is 3 * $1 = $3
* The total cost of the folders, pencils, and erasers is $36 + $36 + $3 = $75
* Mary spent a total of $80
* So, the cost of the set of paints must be $80 - $75 = $5

Answer: $5
