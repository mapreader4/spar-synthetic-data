Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farmer has 3 trucks
* Each truck has 3 tanks
* Each tank has a capacity of 150 liters of water

To calculate the total water capacity, we need to:
1. Calculate the total capacity of each truck
2. Multiply the total capacity of each truck by the number of trucks

Step 1: Calculating the total capacity of each truck
* Each truck has 3 tanks
* Each tank has a capacity of 150 liters
* So the total capacity of each truck is 3 x 150 = 450 liters

Step 2: Calculating the total water capacity of all 3 trucks
* There are 3 trucks
* Each truck has a capacity of 450 liters
* So the total water capacity of all 3 trucks is 3 x 450 = 1,350 liters

Answer: 1,350 liters
