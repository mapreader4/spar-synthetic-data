Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Darren bought 4 boxes of crackers
2) Each box contained 24 crackers
3) So the total number of crackers Darren bought is:
   4 boxes x 24 crackers per box = 96 crackers
4) Calvin bought one box less than twice as many boxes as Darren
5) Twice as many boxes as Darren is 4 x 2 = 8 boxes
6) One box less than 8 boxes is 7 boxes
7) Each box contained 24 crackers
8) So the total number of crackers Calvin bought is:
   7 boxes x 24 crackers per box = 168 crackers
9) The total number of crackers they bought altogether is:
   Darren's crackers (96) + Calvin's crackers (168) = 264 crackers

Answer: 264
