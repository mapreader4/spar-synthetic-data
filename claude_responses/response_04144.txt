Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You have $32 to spend on groceries
* You buy a loaf of bread for $3
* You buy a candy bar for $2
* You spend 1/3 of what's left on a turkey

First, let's calculate how much you've spent so far:
* Bread: $3
* Candy bar: $2
* Total spent so far: $3 + $2 = $5

Now, let's calculate how much money is left after buying the bread and candy bar:
* Initial amount: $32
* Amount spent: $5
* Amount left: $32 - $5 = $27

You said you spend 1/3 of what's left on a turkey. So, the amount spent on the turkey is:
* 1/3 of $27 = $9

Now, we can calculate the final amount of money left:
* Initial amount: $32
* Amount spent: $5 + $9 = $14
* Amount left: $32 - $14 = $18

Answer: $18
