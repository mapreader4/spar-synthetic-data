Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jordan read 120 French novels during the holiday.
2) Alexandre read 1/10 of what Jordan read.
3) To find how many novels Alexandre read, we take 1/10 of 120:
1/10 of 120 = 120 / 10 = 12 novels.
4) To find how many more novels Jordan read than Alexandre, we subtract Alexandre's total from Jordan's total:
120 novels - 12 novels = 108 more novels.

Answer: 108
