Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The TV show was aired for 1.5 hours total
* There were 3 commercials, each lasting 10 minutes
* To find the duration of the TV show itself, we need to subtract the total time of the commercials from the total time of the show

First, let's calculate the total time of the commercials:
* 3 commercials x 10 minutes each = 30 minutes total

Now, let's convert the total time of the show and the commercials to the same unit (minutes):
* 1.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes total
* 30 minutes of commercials

Finally, we can subtract the commercial time from the total time to get the duration of the TV show itself:
* 90 minutes - 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Converting back to hours:
* 60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour

Answer: 1 hour
