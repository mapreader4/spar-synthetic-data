Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each bag has 7 cookies
* Each box has 12 cookies
* We want to find the difference between the number of cookies in 8 boxes and 9 bags

First, let's calculate the number of cookies in 8 boxes:
* 8 boxes x 12 cookies per box = 96 cookies

Next, let's calculate the number of cookies in 9 bags:
* 9 bags x 7 cookies per bag = 63 cookies

Now, we can find the difference:
* 96 cookies (in 8 boxes) - 63 cookies (in 9 bags) = 33 cookies

Answer: 33
