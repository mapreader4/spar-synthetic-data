Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Katy eats 5 brownies on Monday
* On Tuesday, she eats twice as many brownies as she did on Monday
* On Tuesday, she eats 2 x 5 = 10 brownies
* After eating the brownies on Tuesday, all of the brownies she made are gone

To find the total number of brownies Katy made, we need to add the number of brownies she ate on Monday and Tuesday:
* Brownies eaten on Monday: 5
* Brownies eaten on Tuesday: 10
* Total brownies eaten: 5 + 10 = 15

Therefore, Katy made a total of 15 brownies.

Answer: 15
