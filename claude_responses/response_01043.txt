Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of the couch is $2500.
2) The cost of the sectional is $3500.
3) The combined cost of everything else is $2000.
4) James gets a 10% discount on everything.
5) To calculate the total cost before the discount:
   - Couch: $2500
   - Sectional: $3500
   - Everything else: $2000
   - Total before discount: $2500 + $3500 + $2000 = $8000
6) To calculate the 10% discount:
   - 10% of $8000 = $800
7) To calculate the total cost after the 10% discount:
   - $8000 - $800 = $7200

Answer: $7200
