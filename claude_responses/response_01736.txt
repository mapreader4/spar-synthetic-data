Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The box contains 12 chocolate bars.
2) The bars are shared equally between Mike, Rita, and Anita.
3) To find the number of bars that Mike and Rita get combined, we need to find the number of bars each person gets.
4) Since the bars are shared equally, each person gets 12 / 3 = 4 bars.
5) Therefore, Mike and Rita get 4 bars each, so combined they get 4 + 4 = 8 bars.

Answer: 8
