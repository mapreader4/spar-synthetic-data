Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pet store has 6 dogs for sale
* They have half as many cats as dogs, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 cats
* They have twice as many birds as dogs, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 birds
* They have thrice as many fish as dogs, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 fish

Now, to find the total number of animals for sale, we add up all the animals:
* 6 dogs + 3 cats + 12 birds + 18 fish = 39 animals

Answer: 39
