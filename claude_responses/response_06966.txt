Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Darnell pays $12 for unlimited texting and calling on his current plan
* The alternative plan charges:
  - $1 per 30 texts
  - $3 per 20 minutes of calls
* Darnell sends 60 texts and spends 60 minutes on the phone each month

First, let's calculate the cost of the alternative plan:
* Texts: 60 texts / 30 texts per $1 = 2 x $1 = $2
* Calls: 60 minutes / 20 minutes per $3 = 3 x $3 = $9
* Total cost of alternative plan: $2 + $9 = $11

Now, let's compare the two plans:
* Darnell's current plan costs $12 per month
* The alternative plan costs $11 per month
* The difference between the two plans is $12 - $11 = $1

Answer: $1
