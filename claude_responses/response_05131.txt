Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Connor scored 2 points.
2) Amy scored 4 more points than Connor, so Amy scored 2 + 4 = 6 points.
3) Jason scored twice the score of Amy, so Jason scored 6 x 2 = 12 points.
4) The total points scored by the team is the sum of the points scored by Connor, Amy, and Jason.
5) The total points scored by the team is 2 + 6 + 12 = 20 points.

Answer: 20
