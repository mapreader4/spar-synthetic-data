Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 160 tissues inside each tissue box.
2) Tucker bought 3 boxes of tissues.
3) To find the total number of tissues Tucker bought, we multiply the number of tissues per box (160) by the number of boxes he bought (3):
160 tissues per box x 3 boxes = 480 total tissues bought.
4) Tucker used 210 tissues while he was sick with the flu.
5) To find the number of tissues he has left, we subtract the number of tissues he used (210) from the total number of tissues he bought (480):
480 total tissues - 210 tissues used = 270 tissues left.

Answer: 270
