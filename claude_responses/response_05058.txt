Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The 4th graders planted 30 trees
* The 5th graders planted twice as many trees as the 4th graders, which is 2 x 30 = 60 trees
* The 6th graders planted 30 fewer than thrice the number of trees planted by the 5th graders
* Thrice the number of trees planted by the 5th graders is 3 x 60 = 180 trees
* The 6th graders planted 180 - 30 = 150 trees

Now, to find the total number of trees planted, we add up the trees planted by each grade:
* 4th graders: 30 trees
* 5th graders: 60 trees
* 6th graders: 150 trees
* Total trees planted = 30 + 60 + 150 = 240 trees

Answer: 240
