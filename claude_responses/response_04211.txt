Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that the average number of fruits per basket in five baskets is 25.
2) The total number of fruits in the five baskets is 5 * 25 = 125 fruits.
3) We know the contents of baskets A, B, C, and D:
   - Basket A has 15 apples
   - Basket B has 30 mangoes
   - Basket C has 20 peaches
   - Basket D has 25 pears
4) To find the number of bananas in basket E, we need to subtract the known fruits from the total fruits:
   - Total fruits = 125
   - Apples in A = 15
   - Mangoes in B = 30
   - Peaches in C = 20
   - Pears in D = 25
   - Bananas in E = 125 - 15 - 30 - 20 - 25 = 35
Answer: 35
