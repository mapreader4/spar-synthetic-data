Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry has 6 pancakes, each with 120 calories
* So, the total calories from the pancakes is 6 * 120 = 720 calories
* Jerry has 2 strips of bacon, each with 100 calories
* So, the total calories from the bacon is 2 * 100 = 200 calories
* Jerry has a bowl of cereal with 200 calories
* To find the total calories in Jerry's breakfast, we add up the calories from the pancakes, bacon, and cereal:
* 720 + 200 + 200 = 1120 calories

Answer: 1120
