Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony initially bought a bottle of 50 pills
* For the first 2 days, he took 2 pills 3 times a day, which is 6 pills per day
* So for the first 2 days, he took 6 pills x 2 days = 12 pills
* For the next 3 days, he cut the amount in half, so he took 3 pills per day
* For the next 3 days, he took 3 pills x 3 days = 9 pills
* On the sixth day, he took 2 more pills
* In total, he took 12 + 9 + 2 = 23 pills
* Therefore, the number of pills left in the bottle is:
Answer: 50 - 23 = 27 pills
