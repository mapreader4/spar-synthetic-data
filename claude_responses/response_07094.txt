Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Molly got a bike for her 13th birthday
* She rode her bike 3 miles a day, every day
* She rode her bike until she turned 16

To calculate the total number of miles Molly rode, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of days between her 13th and 16th birthdays
2. Multiply the number of days by the number of miles she rode per day

First, let's calculate the number of days between her 13th and 16th birthdays:
* There are 3 years between her 13th and 16th birthdays
* There are 365 days in a year
* 3 years x 365 days/year = 1,095 days

Now, let's multiply the number of days by the number of miles she rode per day:
* 1,095 days x 3 miles/day = 3,285 miles

Answer: 3,285
