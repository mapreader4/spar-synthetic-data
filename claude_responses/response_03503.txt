Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Derek takes 9 minutes to walk 1 mile without his brother
* Derek takes 12 minutes to walk 1 mile with his brother
* We want to find how much longer it would take him to walk 20 miles with his brother compared to without his brother

First, let's calculate how long it would take him to walk 20 miles without his brother:
* 20 miles x 9 minutes/mile = 180 minutes

Now, let's calculate how long it would take him to walk 20 miles with his brother:
* 20 miles x 12 minutes/mile = 240 minutes

To find the difference, we subtract the time without his brother from the time with his brother:
* 240 minutes - 180 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, it would take Derek 60 minutes longer to walk 20 miles if he had to take his brother.

Answer: 60
