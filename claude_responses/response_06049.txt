Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The price of a bag of cherries is $5
* The price of a bag of olives is $7
* Jordyn wants to buy 50 bags of each fruit
* There is a 10% discount

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits without the discount:
* 50 bags of cherries at $5 each = $250
* 50 bags of olives at $7 each = $350
* Total cost = $250 + $350 = $600

Now, let's apply the 10% discount:
* 10% of $600 = $60
* Discounted price = $600 - $60 = $540

Therefore, Jordyn would pay $540 for buying 50 bags of each fruit with a 10% discount.

Answer: $540
