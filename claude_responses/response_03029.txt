Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Roper cuts his lawn 15 days a month from April to September (6 months)
* That means he cuts his lawn 15 times per month for 6 months
* So for the 6 months from April to September, he cuts his lawn a total of 15 x 6 = 90 times
* From October to March (6 months), he cuts his lawn 3 times per month
* So for the 6 months from October to March, he cuts his lawn a total of 3 x 6 = 18 times
* In total, he cuts his lawn 90 + 18 = 108 times per year
* To get the average number of times per month, we divide the total (108) by the number of months in a year (12)
* 108 / 12 = 9
