Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eunice has 10 eggplant seeds
* Eunice has 4 pots
* 3 seeds can be planted in 1 pot

To find the number of seeds that will be planted in the fourth pot, we need to first find out how many seeds will be planted in the first three pots.

* 3 seeds per pot x 3 pots = 9 seeds

Now, we can subtract the 9 seeds planted in the first three pots from the total of 10 seeds Eunice has:

* 10 seeds - 9 seeds = 1 seed

Therefore, the number of seeds that will be planted in the fourth pot is:
