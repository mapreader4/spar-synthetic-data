Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nadia makes 3 mistakes per 40 notes
* She can play about 60 notes per minute
* She plays for 8 minutes

First, let's calculate how many notes she can play in 8 minutes:
* 60 notes per minute x 8 minutes = 480 notes

Now, let's calculate the average number of mistakes she makes:
* 3 mistakes per 40 notes
* 480 notes / 40 notes = 12 sets of 40 notes
* 12 sets x 3 mistakes per set = 36 mistakes

Therefore, on average, Nadia will make 36 mistakes in 8 minutes of playing.

Answer: 36
