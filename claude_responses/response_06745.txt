Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 250 balloons in the package.
2) Dante evenly shared the balloons among his 5 friends. To find how many balloons each friend received, we divide 250 by 5: 250 / 5 = 50 balloons per friend.
3) Dante then asked each of his 5 friends to give him 11 balloons back. So each friend gave Dante 11 balloons.
4) To find how many balloons each friend has now, we start with the 50 balloons they originally received, and subtract the 11 balloons they gave back to Dante.
5) 50 balloons - 11 balloons = 39 balloons per friend.

Answer: 39
