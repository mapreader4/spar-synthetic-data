Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Paul has 5 dogs
* For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day
* The weights of the dogs are:
  - Dog 1: 20 pounds
  - Dog 2: 40 pounds
  - Dog 3: 10 pounds
  - Dog 4: 30 pounds
  - Dog 5: 50 pounds
* To calculate the total amount of dog food needed per day:
  - Dog 1 (20 pounds) needs 2 pounds of dog food per day
  - Dog 2 (40 pounds) needs 4 pounds of dog food per day
  - Dog 3 (10 pounds) needs 1 pound of dog food per day
  - Dog 4 (30 pounds) needs 3 pounds of dog food per day
  - Dog 5 (50 pounds) needs 5 pounds of dog food per day
* Adding up the amounts for each dog:
  - 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 15 pounds of dog food per day
