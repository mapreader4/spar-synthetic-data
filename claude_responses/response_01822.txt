Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On the first day, the ship travels 100 miles north.

2. On the second day, the ship travels east a distance that is three times the distance covered on the first day. 
   * Distance covered on the first day: 100 miles
   * Distance covered on the second day: 3 x 100 = 300 miles

3. On the third day, the ship travels further east for 110 more miles than the distance it covered on the second day.
   * Distance covered on the second day: 300 miles
   * Distance covered on the third day: 300 + 110 = 410 miles

Now, to calculate the total distance the ship has traveled in the three days, we add up the distances covered on each day:
* Total distance = 100 miles (first day) + 300 miles (second day) + 410 miles (third day)
* Total distance = 810 miles

Answer: 810
