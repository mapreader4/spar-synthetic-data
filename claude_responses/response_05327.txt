Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial prices:
   - Jewelry: $30 each
   - Paintings: $100 each

2. Price increase:
   - Jewelry: Increased by $10 each, so new price is $30 + $10 = $40 each
   - Paintings: Increased by 20%, so new price is $100 + (20% of $100) = $100 + $20 = $120 each

3. Buyer purchases:
   - 2 pieces of jewelry at $40 each
   - 5 paintings at $120 each

4. Total cost:
   - Jewelry: 2 x $40 = $80
   - Paintings: 5 x $120 = $600
   - Total price = $80 + $600 = $680

Answer: 680
