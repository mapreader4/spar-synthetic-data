Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Antoinette weighs 7 less kilograms than twice Rupert's weight. This means that Antoinette's weight can be represented as 2 * Rupert's weight - 7.
2) Together, Antoinette and Rupert weigh 98 kilograms. This means that Antoinette's weight + Rupert's weight = 98.
3) Substituting Antoinette's weight with 2 * Rupert's weight - 7, we get:
2 * Rupert's weight - 7 + Rupert's weight = 98
3 * Rupert's weight - 7 = 98
3 * Rupert's weight = 105
Rupert's weight = 35
4) Now that we know Rupert's weight is 35 kilograms, we can calculate Antoinette's weight:
Antoinette's weight = 2 * 35 - 7 = 63 kilograms.

Answer: 63 kilograms.
