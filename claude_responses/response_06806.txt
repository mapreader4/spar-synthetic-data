Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Daniel normally pays $4 per Russian doll
* He saved enough money to buy 15 Russian dolls at the normal price of $4 each
* So the total amount of money he saved is:
    * 15 dolls x $4 per doll = $60
* Now the price has dropped to $3 per Russian doll
* With the $60 he has saved, he can now buy:
    * $60 / $3 per doll = 20 Russian dolls

Answer: 20
