Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Pauline bought a box of taco shells that cost $5.
2. She bought 4 bell peppers that cost $1.5 each. So the total cost of the bell peppers is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
3. She bought 2 pounds of meat that cost $3 per pound. So the total cost of the meat is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, to calculate the total amount Pauline spent, we add up the costs of the taco shells, bell peppers, and meat:
$5 + $6 + $6 = $17

Answer: $17
