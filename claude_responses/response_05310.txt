Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah can read 40 words per minute
* The books she is checking out have 100 words per page and are 80 pages long
* She will be reading for 20 hours

First, let's calculate how many words she can read in 20 hours:
* 40 words per minute x 60 minutes per hour = 2,400 words per hour
* 2,400 words per hour x 20 hours = 48,000 words

Now, let's calculate how many words are in each book:
* 100 words per page x 80 pages = 8,000 words per book

Finally, to determine how many books she should check out, we divide the total number of words she can read (48,000) by the number of words in each book (8,000):
* 48,000 words / 8,000 words per book = 6 books

Answer: 6
