Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Logan makes $65,000 a year
* He spends:
    - $20,000 on rent
    - $5,000 on groceries
    - $8,000 on gas
* So his total expenses are:
    - $20,000 + $5,000 + $8,000 = $33,000
* He wants to have at least $42,000 left
* To calculate how much more he needs to make, we take the desired amount left ($42,000) and subtract his total expenses ($33,000):
    - $42,000 - $33,000 = $9,000

Answer: $9,000
