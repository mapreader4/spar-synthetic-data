Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gerald spends $100 a month on baseball supplies
* His baseball season is 4 months long
* So the total he spends on baseball supplies for the season is:
    * $100 per month x 4 months = $400
* He wants to save up for this by doing chores (raking, shoveling, mowing lawns) in the 8 months he's not playing baseball
* He charges $10 for each chore
* To calculate how many chores he needs to average per month, we need to divide the total cost of his baseball supplies ($400) by the amount he earns per chore ($10)
* $400 / $10 per chore = 40 chores
* Dividing 40 chores by the 8 months he has to save up, that means he needs to average 5 chores per month.
