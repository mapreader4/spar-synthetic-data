Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls.
2) Each pack contained 18 bouncy balls.
3) So the total number of red bouncy balls is 7 packs x 18 balls per pack = 126 red bouncy balls.
4) Kate also bought 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls.
5) Each pack contained 18 bouncy balls.
6) So the total number of yellow bouncy balls is 6 packs x 18 balls per pack = 108 yellow bouncy balls.
7) To find the difference between the number of red and yellow bouncy balls, we subtract the number of yellow bouncy balls from the number of red bouncy balls:
126 red bouncy balls - 108 yellow bouncy balls = 18 more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls.

Answer: 18
