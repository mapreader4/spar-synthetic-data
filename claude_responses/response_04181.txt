Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hannah wants to save $80 over 5 weeks
* In the first week, she saved $4
* In each subsequent week, she plans to save twice as much as the previous week

So, let's calculate the savings for each week:
* Week 1: $4
* Week 2: $4 x 2 = $8
* Week 3: $8 x 2 = $16
* Week 4: $16 x 2 = $32
* Week 5: $32 x 2 = $64

Now, we need to calculate how much she needs to save in the fifth week to reach her goal of $80.
* Total saved in first 4 weeks: $4 + $8 + $16 + $32 = $60
* Amount needed to save in 5th week: $80 - $60 = $20

Answer: $20
