Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim watches 2 shows
* One show is a half-hour show per episode
* The other show is a 1-hour show per episode
* The short show had 24 episodes
* The long show had 12 episodes

To calculate the total hours of TV Tim watched, we need to find the total time for each show and then add them together.

For the short show:
* Each episode is 0.5 hours (half-hour)
* There are 24 episodes
* Total time for the short show = 0.5 hours x 24 episodes = 12 hours

For the long show:
* Each episode is 1 hour
* There are 12 episodes
* Total time for the long show = 1 hour x 12 episodes = 12 hours

Now we add the total time for both shows:
* Total hours of TV watched = 12 hours + 12 hours = 24 hours

Answer: 24
