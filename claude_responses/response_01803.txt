Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 90 students who have lunch during period 5
* Two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria
* The remaining one-third of the students sat at the covered picnic tables outside
* One-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria
* 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about

First, let's calculate how many students were initially in the cafeteria:
* Two-thirds of 90 students = 2/3 * 90 = 60 students

Next, let's calculate how many students were initially outside:
* One-third of 90 students = 1/3 * 90 = 30 students

Now, one-third of the 30 students outside ran inside to the cafeteria:
* 1/3 * 30 = 10 students

Finally, 3 students from the cafeteria went outside:
* 60 - 3 = 57 students

Answer: 57 students are now in the cafeteria.
