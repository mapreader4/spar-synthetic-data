Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Spam costs $3 per can
* Granger bought 12 cans of spam
* So, the total cost of the spam is 12 cans x $3 per can = $36

* Peanut butter costs $5 per jar
* Granger bought 3 jars of peanut butter
* So, the total cost of the peanut butter is 3 jars x $5 per jar = $15

* Bread costs $2 per loaf
* Granger bought 4 loaves of bread
* So, the total cost of the bread is 4 loaves x $2 per loaf = $8

Now, to calculate the total amount Granger paid, we add up the costs of the spam, peanut butter, and bread:
$36 + $15 + $8 = $59

Answer: 59
