Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Ruth ate 1 sandwich
* Ruth gave 2 sandwiches to her brother
* Ruth's first cousin ate 2 sandwiches
* Ruth's two other cousins each ate 1 sandwich, so that's 2 more sandwiches
* There were 3 sandwiches left

To find the total number of sandwiches Ruth prepared, we need to add up all the sandwiches that were eaten and the 3 sandwiches that were left.

Sandwiches eaten:
* Ruth: 1
* Brother: 2
* First cousin: 2
* Two other cousins: 2

Total sandwiches eaten: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

Sandwiches left: 3

Total sandwiches prepared: Sandwiches eaten + Sandwiches left = 7 + 3 = 10

Answer: 10
