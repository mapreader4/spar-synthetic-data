Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alvin is 30 years old
* Simon is 5 years away from being 1/2 the age of Alvin
* To find Simon's age, we need to first find 1/2 of Alvin's age
* 1/2 of Alvin's age is 1/2 * 30 = 15
* Simon is 5 years away from being 15 years old
* So, Simon's age is 15 - 5 = 10

Answer: 10
