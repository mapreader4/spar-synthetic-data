Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John writes 3 stories every week
* Each short story is 50 pages
* He also writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year
* Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages
* We need to find how many reams of paper he needs to buy over 12 weeks

First, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes in 12 weeks:
* 3 stories per week x 50 pages per story = 150 pages per week
* 150 pages per week x 12 weeks = 1,800 pages for the short stories
* 1 novel per year = 1,200 pages
* Total pages written in 12 weeks = 1,800 + 1,200 = 3,000 pages

Now, let's calculate how many sheets of paper he needs:
* Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages
* 3,000 pages / 2 pages per sheet = 1,500 sheets of paper

Finally, let's calculate how many reams of paper he needs to buy:
* 1 ream = 500 sheets
* 1,500 sheets / 500 sheets per ream = 3 reams

Answer: 3 reams
