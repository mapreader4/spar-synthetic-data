Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Penelope the pig eats 20 pounds of food per day
* Greta the goose eats 1/10 as much as Penelope, so Greta eats 2 pounds per day
* Milton the mouse eats 1/100 as much as Greta, so Milton eats 0.02 pounds per day
* Elmer the elephant eats 4000 times more than Milton, so Elmer eats 80 pounds per day

Now, to find how much more Elmer eats per day than Penelope:
* Elmer eats 80 pounds per day
* Penelope eats 20 pounds per day
* The difference is 80 - 20 = 60 pounds

Answer: 60
