Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lily has been buying 1 hydrangea plant per year since 1989.
2) Each hydrangea plant costs $20.00.
3) We need to calculate the total amount of money Lily has spent on hydrangeas from 1989 to 2021.
4) The number of years between 1989 and 2021 is 2021 - 1989 = 32 years.
5) Since Lily buys 1 hydrangea plant per year, she has bought 32 hydrangea plants in total.
6) The total cost of the 32 hydrangea plants is 32 * $20.00 = $640.00.

Answer: $640
