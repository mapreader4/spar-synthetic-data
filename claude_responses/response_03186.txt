Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, Chandra saw 2 monsters
* Every day after that, she saw double the amount as the day before
* We need to find the total number of monsters she saw after 5 days

Day 1: 2 monsters
Day 2: 2 x 2 = 4 monsters
Day 3: 4 x 2 = 8 monsters
Day 4: 8 x 2 = 16 monsters
Day 5: 16 x 2 = 32 monsters

To find the total number of monsters, we add up the number of monsters seen each day:
2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 monsters

Answer: 62
