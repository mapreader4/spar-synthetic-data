Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jeanine bought 18 pencils.
2) Clare bought half as many pencils as Jeanine, which means Clare bought 9 pencils.
3) Jeanine gave one third of his pencils to Abby. One third of 18 is 6, so Jeanine gave 6 pencils to Abby.
4) Jeanine now has 18 - 6 = 12 pencils.
5) Jeanine has 12 pencils and Clare has 9 pencils, so Jeanine has 12 - 9 = 3 more pencils than Clare.
