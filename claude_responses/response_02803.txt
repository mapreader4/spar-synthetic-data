Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Todd starts with $20.
2) He buys 4 candy bars that cost $2 each.
3) To calculate the total cost of the candy bars, we multiply the cost per candy bar ($2) by the number of candy bars (4):
   $2 x 4 = $8
4) To calculate how much money Todd has left, we subtract the total cost of the candy bars ($8) from the amount of money he started with ($20):
   $20 - $8 = $12

Answer: 12
