Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Travis is hired to deliver 638 bowls
* The home goods store will pay the moving company a $100 fee
* The home goods store will pay $3 for every bowl that is delivered safely
* Travis must pay the home goods store $4 for each bowl that is lost or broken
* 12 bowls are lost
* 15 bowls are broken
* The rest are delivered safely

First, let's calculate the number of bowls that were delivered safely:
* Total bowls = 638
* Bowls lost = 12
* Bowls broken = 15
* Bowls delivered safely = 638 - 12 - 15 = 611

Now, let's calculate the total amount Travis should be paid:
* Home goods store fee = $100
* Payment for bowls delivered safely = 611 * $3 = $1,833
* Cost of lost/broken bowls = (12 + 15) * $4 = $108
* Total amount Travis should be paid = $100 + $1,833 - $108 = $1,825

Answer: $1,825
