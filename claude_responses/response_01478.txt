Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John bought a tennis racket, sneakers that cost $200, and a sports outfit that cost $250.
* He spent a total of $750 for all those items.
* To find the price of the racket, we need to subtract the cost of the sneakers and sports outfit from the total amount spent.
* The cost of the sneakers and sports outfit is $200 + $250 = $450.
* The total amount spent is $750.
* Therefore, the price of the racket is $750 - $450 = $300.

Answer: 300
