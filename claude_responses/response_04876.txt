Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* MegaCorp earns $3,000,000 per day from mining
* MegaCorp earns $5,000,000 per day from oil refining
* So, MegaCorp's total daily revenue is $3,000,000 + $5,000,000 = $8,000,000
* MegaCorp's monthly expenses are $30,000,000
* So, MegaCorp's monthly profit is $8,000,000 * 30 days - $30,000,000 = $210,000,000
* MegaCorp is being fined 1% of its annual profits
* MegaCorp's annual profits are $210,000,000 * 12 months = $2,520,000,000
* 1% of $2,520,000,000 is $25,200,000

Answer: $25,200,000
