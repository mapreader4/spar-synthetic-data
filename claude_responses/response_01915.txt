Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Building one birdhouse requires 7 planks and 20 nails
* 1 nail costs $0.05
* 1 plank costs $3
* We need to build 4 birdhouses

First, let's calculate the cost of the nails for 4 birdhouses:
* 20 nails per birdhouse x 4 birdhouses = 80 nails
* 80 nails x $0.05 per nail = $4

Next, let's calculate the cost of the planks for 4 birdhouses:
* 7 planks per birdhouse x 4 birdhouses = 28 planks
* 28 planks x $3 per plank = $84

Finally, to get the total cost, we add the cost of the nails and the cost of the planks:
* $4 + $84 = $88

Answer: $88
