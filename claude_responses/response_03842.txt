Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark bought a shirt, pants, and shoes for $340 in total.
* The price of the shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants.
* The price of the shoes is $10 more than the price of the pants.

Let's define the variables:
* Let x be the price of the pants.
* Then the price of the shirt is 3/4 * x.
* The price of the shoes is x + $10.

We can set up an equation to represent the total cost:
* Total cost = Price of pants + Price of shirt + Price of shoes
* $340 = x + 3/4 * x + (x + $10)
* $340 = 2.75x + $10
* $330 = 2.75x
* x = $120

Therefore, the price of the pants is $120.

Answer: 120
