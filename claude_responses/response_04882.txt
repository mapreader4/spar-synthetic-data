Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The problem states that 5/8 of shoppers at the All Goods Available store prefer to avoid the check-out line on weekends and instead go through the express lane.
2) This means that the remaining 3/8 of shoppers go through the check-out lane.
3) The total number of shoppers in the store is 480.
4) To find the number of shoppers who pay at the check-out lane, we need to calculate 3/8 of 480.
5) 3/8 of 480 = (3/8) * 480 = 180.

Answer: 180
