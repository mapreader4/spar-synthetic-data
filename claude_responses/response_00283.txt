Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lily has 5 lottery tickets to sell
* She sells the first ticket for $1
* Each successive ticket is sold for $1 more than the previous ticket
* So the ticket prices are: $1, $2, $3, $4, $5
* Lily plans to keep a $4 profit
* The remaining money will be given as the prize

To calculate the total amount of money Lily will receive from selling the 5 tickets:
* Ticket 1: $1
* Ticket 2: $2
* Ticket 3: $3
* Ticket 4: $4
* Ticket 5: $5
* Total: $1 + $2 + $3 + $4 + $5 = $15

Lily plans to keep a $4 profit, so the remaining money will be the prize.
* Prize = Total money received - Lily's profit
* Prize = $15 - $4 = $11

Answer: $11
