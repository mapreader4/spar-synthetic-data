Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Travis goes through 2 boxes of cereal a week
* Each box costs $3.00
* He eats 2 boxes every week for an entire year, which is 52 weeks

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost per week
   * 2 boxes per week x $3.00 per box = $6.00 per week
2. Calculate the total cost for the entire year
   * $6.00 per week x 52 weeks = $312.00

Therefore, the total amount Travis spends on cereal for the entire year is:

Answer: $312
