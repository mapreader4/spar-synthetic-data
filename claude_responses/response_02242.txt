Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Xavier runs 3 times as many miles as Katie
* Katie runs 4 times as many miles as Cole
* Xavier runs 84 miles

First, we can find how many miles Katie runs:
* Xavier runs 3 times as many miles as Katie
* So, Katie runs 84 / 3 = 28 miles

Next, we can find how many miles Cole runs:
* Katie runs 4 times as many miles as Cole
* So, Cole runs 28 / 4 = 7 miles

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 7 miles
