Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 13 rooms for couples and 14 single rooms.
2) For each bath that is run, Isabelle needs 10ml of bubble bath.
3) If every room is filled to maximum capacity, that means:
   - The 13 couple rooms will have 2 people each, so 13 x 2 = 26 people
   - The 14 single rooms will have 1 person each, so 14 x 1 = 14 people
   - The total number of people is 26 + 14 = 40 people
4) Since each bath requires 10ml of bubble bath, and there are 40 people, the total amount of bubble bath needed is:
   - 40 people x 10ml per bath = 400ml of bubble bath

Answer: 400
