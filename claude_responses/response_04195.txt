Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In June, Katy read 8 books.
* In July, Katy read twice as many books as in June, which means she read 8 x 2 = 16 books.
* In August, Katy read 3 fewer books than in July, which means she read 16 - 3 = 13 books.

Now, to find the total number of books Katy read during the summer, we add up the books read in each month:
* Total books read = 8 + 16 + 13 = 37

Answer: 37
