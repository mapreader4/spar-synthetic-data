Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eva's mom bought 50 balloons and 1800cm³ of helium
* Each balloon needs 50cm³ of helium to float high enough to touch the ceiling
* The remaining balloons can be filled with ordinary air

First, let's calculate how many balloons can be filled with the 1800cm³ of helium:
* 1800cm³ / 50cm³ per balloon = 36 balloons

So, 36 balloons can be filled with the helium and will touch the ceiling.

Now, let's calculate how many balloons are left to be filled with ordinary air:
* 50 total balloons - 36 helium-filled balloons = 14 balloons

Therefore, the number of balloons touching the ceiling is 36, and the number of balloons not touching the ceiling is 14.
