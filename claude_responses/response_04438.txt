Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The fall semester lasts 15 weeks
* During the weekdays (Monday-Friday), Paris studies 3 hours a day
* There are 5 weekdays in a week
* So during the weekdays, Paris studies:
  - 3 hours per day x 5 days per week = 15 hours per week
  - 15 hours per week x 15 weeks = 225 hours during the semester
* On Saturday, Paris studies 4 hours
* On Sunday, Paris studies 5 hours
* So on the weekends, Paris studies:
  - 4 hours on Saturday + 5 hours on Sunday = 9 hours per week
  - 9 hours per week x 15 weeks = 135 hours during the semester
* To find the total time Paris studies during the semester, we add the time spent studying during the weekdays and the weekends:
  - 225 hours + 135 hours = 360 hours

Answer: 360
