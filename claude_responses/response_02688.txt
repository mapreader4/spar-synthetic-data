Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roy has 2 blue pens
* He has twice as many black pens as blue pens
* So, if he has 2 blue pens, he must have 2 x 2 = 4 black pens
* He has 2 less than twice as many red pens as black pens
* So, if he has 4 black pens, he must have (2 x 4) - 2 = 6 red pens
* Now, to find the total number of pens Roy has, we add up the blue, black, and red pens:
* 2 blue pens + 4 black pens + 6 red pens = 12 pens

Answer: 12
