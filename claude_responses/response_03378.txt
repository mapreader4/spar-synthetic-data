Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Krista has 10 hens that lay eggs
* She sells the eggs for $3 per dozen
* In four weeks, she sold $120 worth of eggs
* We need to find how many eggs each hen lays per week

First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs she sold in four weeks:
* $120 worth of eggs at $3 per dozen = 40 dozens of eggs sold in four weeks

Now, we can calculate how many eggs she sold in total:
* 40 dozens of eggs = 40 x 12 = 480 eggs sold in four weeks

Next, we can calculate how many eggs each hen laid per week:
* 480 eggs sold in four weeks / 10 hens = 48 eggs per hen in four weeks
* 48 eggs per hen in four weeks / 4 weeks = 12 eggs per hen per week

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 12
