Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The clerk can process 25 forms per hour.
2) There are 8 hours in a day.
3) So the clerk can process 25 forms x 8 hours = 200 forms per day.
4) The total number of forms that must be processed in the day is 2400.
5) To find the number of clerks needed, we divide the total number of forms (2400) by the number of forms a single clerk can process per day (200).
6) 2400 forms / 200 forms per clerk = 12 clerks.

Answer: 12 clerks.
