Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Steve spends 1/3 of the day sleeping
* He spends 1/6 of the day in school
* He spends 1/12 of the day making assignments
* The rest of the day is spent with his family

To find the time spent with his family, we need to find the remaining time after subtracting the time spent on other activities.

First, let's add up the time spent on other activities:
* 1/3 of the day sleeping
* 1/6 of the day in school
* 1/12 of the day making assignments
* Total = 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/12 = 1/2 + 1/12 = 7/12 of the day

Now, we can find the time spent with his family by subtracting the time spent on other activities from the total day:
* Time spent with family = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12 of the day

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the number of hours Steve spends with his family:
* 5/12 of 24 hours = 10 hours

Answer: 10 hours
