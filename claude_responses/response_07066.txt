Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The school bought 20 cartons of pencils.
   - Each carton of pencils has 10 boxes.
   - Each box of pencils costs $2.
   - So, the total cost of the pencils is:
     20 cartons x 10 boxes per carton x $2 per box = $400

2. The school also bought 10 cartons of markers.
   - Each carton of markers has 5 boxes.
   - Each box of markers costs $4.
   - So, the total cost of the markers is:
     10 cartons x 5 boxes per carton x $4 per box = $200

3. To find the total amount the school spent, we add the cost of the pencils and the cost of the markers:
   $400 + $200 = $600

Answer: 600
