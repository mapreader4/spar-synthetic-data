Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, Oliver worked out for 4 hours.
2. On Tuesday, he worked out for 2 hours less than on Monday, which means he worked out for 4 - 2 = 2 hours.
3. On Wednesday, he worked out twice as much as on Monday, which means he worked out for 4 x 2 = 8 hours.
4. On Thursday, the gym was closed, so Oliver needed to exercise at home, which took twice as much time as on Tuesday, which means he worked out for 2 x 2 = 4 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours Oliver worked out during these four days:
4 hours (Monday) + 2 hours (Tuesday) + 8 hours (Wednesday) + 4 hours (Thursday) = 18 hours

Answer: 18 hours
