Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The wall initially had 3 courses of bricks, with 400 bricks in each course.
* So the initial number of bricks in the wall was 3 x 400 = 1,200 bricks.
* They then added 2 more courses, each with 400 bricks.
* So the additional bricks added were 2 x 400 = 800 bricks.
* The total number of bricks in the wall after the 2 additional courses was 1,200 + 800 = 2,000 bricks.
* They then removed half of the bricks in the last course, which was 400 / 2 = 200 bricks.
* So the final number of bricks in the wall is 2,000 - 200 = 1,800 bricks.

Answer: 1,800
