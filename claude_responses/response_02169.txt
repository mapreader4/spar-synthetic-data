Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) John ran 5 miles at a constant speed of 15 mph.
2) To calculate the time it took John to run the 5-mile race, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed
3) Time = 5 miles / 15 mph = 1/3 hour
4) Converting 1/3 hour to minutes, we get 20 minutes.
5) The next fastest guy ran the race in 23 minutes.
6) To find the difference in time between John's race and the next fastest guy's race, we subtract 23 minutes from 20 minutes.

Answer: 3 minutes
