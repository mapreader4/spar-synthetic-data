Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mike is currently 16 years old.
2) Barbara is half as old as Mike, so she is currently 8 years old (16 / 2 = 8).
3) We want to find out how old Barbara will be when Mike is 24 years old.
4) The difference between Mike's current age (16) and his age when he is 24 is 8 years (24 - 16 = 8).
5) Since Barbara is currently 8 years old, and 8 years have passed, she will be 16 years old when Mike is 24 years old.

Answer: 16
