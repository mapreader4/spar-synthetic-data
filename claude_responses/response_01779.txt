Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Gavin has had 4 dreams every day for a year now.
   * In one year, he has had 4 dreams per day x 365 days = 1,460 dreams.

2. Gavin had twice as many dreams last year as he had this year.
   * If he had 1,460 dreams this year, then last year he had 2 x 1,460 = 2,920 dreams.

3. To calculate the total number of dreams he's had in the two years:
   * This year: 1,460 dreams
   * Last year: 2,920 dreams
   * Total dreams in two years: 1,460 + 2,920 = 4,380 dreams

Answer: 4,380
