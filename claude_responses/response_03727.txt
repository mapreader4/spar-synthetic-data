Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Steph bought 24 pieces of drumstick
* She also bought 4 fewer breast parts than drumstick pieces
* To find the number of breast parts, we subtract 4 from the number of drumstick pieces:
* 24 drumstick pieces - 4 = 20 breast parts
* Now, to find the total number of fried chickens Steph can make, we need to divide the total number of pieces by 2, since each fried chicken has 1 drumstick and 1 breast part.
* Total number of pieces = 24 drumsticks + 20 breast parts = 44 pieces
* 44 pieces / 2 = 22 fried chickens

Answer: 22
