Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jessa needs to make cupcakes for 3 fourth-grade classes
* Each fourth-grade class has 30 students
* So for the 3 fourth-grade classes, the total number of students is:
  * 3 classes x 30 students per class = 90 students
* Jessa also needs to make cupcakes for a P.E. class with 50 students
* To find the total number of cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we add the number of students in the fourth-grade classes and the P.E. class:
  * 90 students + 50 students = 140 students

Answer: 140
