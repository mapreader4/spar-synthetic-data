Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies before crying.
2) Jacob can only manage half of that number of candies, which is 12 / 2 = 6 candies.
3) Lana can only do three fewer than Jacob, which is 6 - 3 = 3 candies.
4) They had a bucket of 30 candies, and all of them ate until they cried.
5) So the total number of candies eaten is 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 candies.
6) The remaining candies in the bucket is 30 - 21 = 9 candies.
7) If they divide the remaining candies in the bucket equally, each of them will get 9 / 3 = 3 candies.
