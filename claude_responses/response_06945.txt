Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Josh bought 3 packs of string cheese
* Each pack has 20 string cheeses
* So, the total number of string cheeses Josh bought is:
  * 3 packs x 20 string cheeses per pack = 60 string cheeses
* Each piece of string cheese costs 10 cents
* To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the total number of string cheeses by the cost per piece:
  * 60 string cheeses x $0.10 per string cheese = $6.00

Answer: $6.00
