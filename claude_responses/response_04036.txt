Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Marjorie makes twice as many cakes each day as she did the day before
* On the sixth day, she makes 320 cakes
* Let's work backwards to find the number of cakes she made on the first day
* On the sixth day, she made 320 cakes
* On the fifth day, she made 160 cakes (half of 320)
* On the fourth day, she made 80 cakes (half of 160)
* On the third day, she made 40 cakes (half of 80)
* On the second day, she made 20 cakes (half of 40)
* On the first day, she made 10 cakes (half of 20)
