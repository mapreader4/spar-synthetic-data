Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We are told that there are three times as many misses as hits in the MLB game.
2) The number of misses is given as 50.
3) Since there are three times as many misses as hits, we can set up the equation:
   Misses = 3 * Hits
4) Plugging in the given value of 50 for Misses, we get:
   50 = 3 * Hits
5) Solving for Hits, we get:
   Hits = 50 / 3 = 16.67
6) Since we cannot have a fractional number of hits, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   Hits = 16
7) Now that we know the number of hits is 16, we can calculate the total number of hits and misses:
   Total Hits + Total Misses = 16 + 50 = 66

Answer: 66
