Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cary starts working at Game Stop for $10/hour.
2) In the first year, she gets a 20% raise. 
   * 20% of $10 is $2.
   * So her new hourly rate is $10 + $2 = $12/hour.
3) In the second year, the company's profits decrease and her pay is cut to 75% of what it used to be.
   * Her previous hourly rate was $12/hour.
   * 75% of $12 is $9/hour.
Therefore, Cary now makes $9/hour.
