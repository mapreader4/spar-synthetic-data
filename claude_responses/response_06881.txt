Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total number of questions on the exam is 50.
* 80% of the questions are problem-solving questions.
* To find the number of problem-solving questions, we take 80% of 50:
* 80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40 problem-solving questions.
* The remaining questions must be multiple-choice questions.
* To find the number of multiple-choice questions, we subtract the number of problem-solving questions from the total number of questions:
* 50 - 40 = 10 multiple-choice questions.

Answer: 10
