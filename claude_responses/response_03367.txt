Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The movie theatre has 250 seats total.
2) The cost of a ticket is $6 for an adult and $4 for a child.
3) The theatre is full, which means all 250 seats are occupied.
4) There are 188 children in the theatre.
5) To calculate the total ticket revenue, we need to find the number of adults in the theatre and then calculate the revenue from both adults and children.
6) The number of adults in the theatre is 250 - 188 = 62.
7) The revenue from the adults is 62 * $6 = $372.
8) The revenue from the children is 188 * $4 = $752.
9) The total ticket revenue is the sum of the revenue from adults and children: $372 + $752 = $1,124.
