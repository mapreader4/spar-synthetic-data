Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dale owns 4 sports cars: red, green, blue, and yellow.
2) The red car can travel at twice the speed of the green car.
3) The green car can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue car.
4) The blue car can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour.
5) The yellow car is broken and cannot move at all.
6) To find the speed of the red car, we first need to find the speed of the green car.
7) Since the green car can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue car, and the blue car can travel at 80 miles per hour, the green car can travel at 8 * 80 = 640 miles per hour.
8) Since the red car can travel at twice the speed of the green car, the red car can travel at 2 * 640 = 1,280 miles per hour.

Answer: 1,280 miles per hour.
