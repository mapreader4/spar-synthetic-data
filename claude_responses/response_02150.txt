Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rhea buys 2 trays of eggs every week
* Each tray has 24 eggs
* So the total number of eggs Rhea buys every week is:
2 trays x 24 eggs per tray = 48 eggs
* Her son and daughter each eat 2 eggs every morning
* That's 2 eggs x 2 people = 4 eggs per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* So the total number of eggs eaten by the son and daughter per week is:
4 eggs per day x 7 days = 28 eggs
* Rhea and her husband each eat 4 eggs every night
* That's 4 eggs x 2 people = 8 eggs per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* So the total number of eggs eaten by Rhea and her husband per week is:
8 eggs per day x 7 days = 56 eggs
* Now we add up the total number of eggs eaten per week:
28 eggs (son and daughter) + 56 eggs (Rhea and husband) = 84 eggs
* The total number of eggs bought per week is 48 eggs
* So the number of eggs not being eaten per week is:
48 eggs - 84 eggs = -36 eggs

Answer: -36 eggs
