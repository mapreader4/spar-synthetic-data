Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nancy takes 3 antacids per day when she eats Indian food
* She eats Indian food 3 times a week
* So, on the days she eats Indian food, she takes 3 antacids per day
* Nancy takes 2 antacids per day when she eats Mexican food
* She eats Mexican food 2 times a week
* So, on the days she eats Mexican food, she takes 2 antacids per day
* On the remaining 2 days of the week, she takes 1 antacid per day
* There are 4 weeks in a month
* So, in a month:
* On the 12 days she eats Indian food, she takes 3 antacids per day, which is 12 * 3 = 36 antacids
* On the 8 days she eats Mexican food, she takes 2 antacids per day, which is 8 * 2 = 16 antacids
* On the remaining 8 days, she takes 1 antacid per day, which is 8 * 1 = 8 antacids
* Adding these up, the total number of antacids she takes per month is:
* 36 + 16 + 8 = 60 antacids

Answer: 60
