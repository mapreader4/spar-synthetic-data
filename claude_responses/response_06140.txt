Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Joyce's favorite movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's movie.
2. Nikki's movie is three times as long as Michael's movie.
3. Ryn's favorite movie is 4/5 times as long as Nikki's favorite movie.
4. Nikki's favorite movie is 30 hours long.

First, let's find the length of Michael's movie:
* Nikki's movie is 3 times as long as Michael's movie
* Nikki's movie is 30 hours long
* Therefore, Michael's movie is 30 / 3 = 10 hours long

Next, let's find the length of Joyce's movie:
* Joyce's movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's movie
* Michael's movie is 10 hours long
* Therefore, Joyce's movie is 10 + 2 = 12 hours long

Now, let's find the length of Ryn's movie:
* Ryn's movie is 4/5 times as long as Nikki's movie
* Nikki's movie is 30 hours long
* Therefore, Ryn's movie is 30 * 4/5 = 24 hours long

Finally, we can calculate the total number of hours of their favorite movies together:
* Joyce's movie: 12 hours
* Michael's movie: 10 hours
* Nikki's movie: 30 hours
* Ryn's movie: 24 hours
* Total: 12 + 10 + 30 + 24 = 76 hours

Answer: 76
