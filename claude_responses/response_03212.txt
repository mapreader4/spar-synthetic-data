Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The condo development has 23 floors in total
* The regular floors have 12 units each
* The top 2 floors are assigned for penthouse units, which have 2 units each
* To calculate the total number of units, we need to:
  1. Calculate the number of regular floors
  2. Multiply the number of regular floors by the number of units per regular floor
  3. Add the number of penthouse units

Step 1: Calculate the number of regular floors
* There are 23 floors in total
* The top 2 floors are penthouse floors
* Therefore, the number of regular floors is 23 - 2 = 21 floors

Step 2: Multiply the number of regular floors by the number of units per regular floor
* There are 21 regular floors
* Each regular floor has 12 units
* 21 floors x 12 units/floor = 252 units

Step 3: Add the number of penthouse units
* There are 2 penthouse floors
* Each penthouse floor has 2 units
* 2 floors x 2 units/floor = 4 units

Therefore, the total number of units in the condo development is:
252 regular units + 4 penthouse units = 256 units

Answer: 256
