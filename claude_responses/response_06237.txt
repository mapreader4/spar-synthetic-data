Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brendan makes $6/hour as a waiter.
2) He's scheduled for 2 8-hour shifts and 1 12-hour shift this week.
   * 2 shifts of 8 hours = 16 hours
   * 1 shift of 12 hours = 12 hours
   * Total hours worked = 16 + 12 = 28 hours
3) He also makes an average of $12 in tips each hour.
   * Total tips = 28 hours * $12/hour = $336
4) Brendan is supposed to pay 20% of his income in taxes.
   * However, he only reports 1/3rd of his tips to the IRS.
   * Reported tips = $336 / 3 = $112
   * Total income = (28 hours * $6/hour) + $112 = $280
5) Taxes owed = 20% of $280 = 0.2 * $280 = $56

Answer: $56
