Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Together, the 3 friends watched 411 short videos
* Kelsey watched 43 more than Ekon
* Ekon watched 17 less than Uma

Let's start by finding out how many videos Ekon watched.
* Ekon watched 17 less than Uma
* So if Uma watched x videos, then Ekon watched x - 17 videos

Now, Kelsey watched 43 more than Ekon, so:
* Kelsey watched (x - 17) + 43 videos

We know that the total number of videos watched by the 3 friends is 411, so:
* x - 17 + (x - 17) + 43 = 411
* 3x - 51 = 411
* 3x = 462
* x = 154

Therefore, Uma watched 154 videos.
And Ekon watched 154 - 17 = 137 videos.
Finally, Kelsey watched 137 + 43 = 180 videos.

Answer: 180
