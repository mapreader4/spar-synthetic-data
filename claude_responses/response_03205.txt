Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The dog's overall length is 30 inches.
2) The dog's tail is half the length of its body.
3) To find the length of the tail, we need to find the length of the body first.
4) The head is 1/6 the length of the body.
5) So the body length is 6/7 of the total length.
6) 6/7 of 30 inches is 25.71 inches.
7) The tail is half the length of the body, so the tail length is 25.71 / 2 = 12.86 inches.

Answer: 13 inches.
