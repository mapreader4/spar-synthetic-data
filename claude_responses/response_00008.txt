Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexis had a budget of $200 for the new business clothes
* She spent:
    - $30 on a button-up shirt
    - $46 on suit pants
    - $38 on a suit coat
    - $11 on socks
    - $18 on a belt
* So the total amount she spent on these items is:
    - $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143
* She has $16 left from her budget, so the amount she spent on the shoes must be:
    - $200 - $143 - $16 = $41

Answer: $41
