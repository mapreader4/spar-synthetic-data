Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Traci and Harris have created 9 cakes each, so a total of 18 cakes
* Each cake needs 100g of flour
* So the total amount of flour needed for all 18 cakes is 18 * 100g = 1800g
* Harris has 400g of flour in his house
* Therefore, the remaining flour needed must have been brought by Traci from her own house

To calculate the amount of flour Traci brought from her own house, we take the total flour needed (1800g) and subtract the amount of flour Harris had (400g):
1800g - 400g = 1400g

Answer: 1400g
