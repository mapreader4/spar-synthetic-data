Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Timothy buys 30 acres of land for $20 per acre.
   * Cost of land = 30 acres x $20 per acre = $600

2. Timothy builds a large house for $120,000.
   * Cost of house = $120,000

3. Timothy gets 20 cows for $1,000 per cow.
   * Cost of cows = 20 cows x $1,000 per cow = $20,000

4. Timothy gets 100 chickens for $5 per chicken.
   * Cost of chickens = 100 chickens x $5 per chicken = $500

5. Timothy installs solar panels, which takes 6 hours to install at a cost of $100 per hour, plus a flat fee of $6,000 for the equipment.
   * Cost of solar panel installation = (6 hours x $100 per hour) + $6,000 = $6,600

Now, we can add up all the costs:
* Total cost = Cost of land + Cost of house + Cost of cows + Cost of chickens + Cost of solar panels
* Total cost = $600 + $120,000 + $20,000 + $500 + $6,600 = $147,700

Answer: $147,700
