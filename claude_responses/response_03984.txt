Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Judson contributed $500.
2) Kenny contributed 20% more money than Judson. 
   * 20% of $500 is $100.
   * So Kenny contributed $500 + $100 = $600.
3) Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny.
   * Camilo contributed $600 + $200 = $800.
4) To find the total cost of painting the house, we add up the contributions from Judson, Kenny, and Camilo:
   * $500 + $600 + $800 = $1,900.

Answer: $1,900
