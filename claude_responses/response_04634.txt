Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cassandra collected 5000 pennies
* James collected 276 fewer pennies than Cassandra
* To find how many pennies James collected, we subtract 276 from Cassandra's 5000 pennies:
   * 5000 - 276 = 4724 pennies
* To find the total number of pennies they donated to charity, we add Cassandra's 5000 pennies and James' 4724 pennies:
   * 5000 + 4724 = 9724 pennies

Answer: 9724
