Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Adlai has 2 dogs
* Dogs have 4 legs each
* So the 2 dogs have a total of 2 * 4 = 8 legs
* Adlai also has 1 chicken
* Chickens have 2 legs
* So the 1 chicken has 2 legs
* To find the total number of animal legs, we add the legs of the dogs and the chicken:
* 8 legs (from the dogs) + 2 legs (from the chicken) = 10 legs

Answer: 10
