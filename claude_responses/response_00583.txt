Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water per minute.
* The medium-sized hole leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole, which is 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 ounces per minute.
* The smallest hole leaks at one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, which is 1.5 ÷ 3 = 0.5 ounces per minute.
* The time period given is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
* To calculate the total amount of water leaked from all three holes over 120 minutes:
* Largest hole: 3 ounces/minute × 120 minutes = 360 ounces
* Medium-sized hole: 1.5 ounces/minute × 120 minutes = 180 ounces
* Smallest hole: 0.5 ounces/minute × 120 minutes = 60 ounces
* Adding these together:
* 360 ounces + 180 ounces + 60 ounces = 600 ounces

Answer: 600 ounces
