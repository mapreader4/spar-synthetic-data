Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* William goes to the library 2 times per week
* Jason goes to the library 4 times more often than William
* We want to find how many times Jason goes to the library in 4 weeks

First, let's calculate how many times William goes to the library in 4 weeks:
* 2 times per week x 4 weeks = 8 times

Now, since Jason goes to the library 4 times more often than William, we can calculate how many times Jason goes to the library in 4 weeks:
* 4 times more often than William = 4 x 8 = 32 times

Answer: 32
