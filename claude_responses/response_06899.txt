Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We are given that the total for the sum and product of Elvie's age and Arielle's age are 131.
2) We are also given that Elvie's age is 10.
3) Let's call Arielle's age 'x'.
4) The sum of Elvie's age and Arielle's age is 10 + x = 131 - x.
5) The product of Elvie's age and Arielle's age is 10x.
6) We can set up an equation: 10 + x + 10x = 131
7) Solving this equation, we get: 11x = 121, so x = 11.
Answer: 11
