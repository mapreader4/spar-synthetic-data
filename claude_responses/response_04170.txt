Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Amon and Rhonda have a combined total of 215 marbles.
2) Amon owns 55 marbles more than Rhonda.
3) Let's represent Rhonda's marbles as x.
4) Since Amon has 55 more marbles than Rhonda, Amon's marbles can be represented as x + 55.
5) The total number of marbles is 215, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 55) = 215
6) Simplifying the equation:
2x + 55 = 215
7) Subtracting 55 from both sides:
2x = 160
8) Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 80
Answer: Rhonda has 80 marbles.
