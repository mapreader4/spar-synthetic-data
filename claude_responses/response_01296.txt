Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* House 1 has 12 carpets
* House 2 has 20 carpets
* House 3 has 10 carpets
* House 4 has twice as many carpets as House 3, which means House 4 has 2 * 10 = 20 carpets

Now, to find the total number of carpets in all 4 houses, we add up the carpets in each house:
* Total carpets = 12 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 62

Answer: 62
