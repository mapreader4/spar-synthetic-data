Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 18 people in the group.
2) Each person gets 3 slices of pizza.
3) So the total number of slices needed is 18 people x 3 slices per person = 54 slices.
4) Each pizza has 9 slices.
5) To calculate the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices needed (54) by the number of slices per pizza (9).
6) 54 slices / 9 slices per pizza = 6 pizzas.
