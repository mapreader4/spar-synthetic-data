Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackson's mom will give him $5 per hour spent on chores
* Jackson spends 2 hours vacuuming, and decides to do this twice
* So for the vacuuming, he earns:
  - 2 hours x 2 times = 4 hours
  - 4 hours x $5 per hour = $20
* He also spends 0.5 hours washing dishes
* And he spends three times as long cleaning the bathroom, which is 0.5 hours x 3 = 1.5 hours
* So for the dishes and bathroom cleaning, he earns:
  - 0.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 2 hours
  - 2 hours x $5 per hour = $10
* In total, the amount of spending money Jackson has earned is:
  - $20 (from vacuuming) + $10 (from dishes and bathroom) = $30

Answer: $30
