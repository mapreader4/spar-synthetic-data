Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The length of the rectangle is four times its width. Let's call the width 'w' and the length '4w'.
2) The area of the rectangle is given as 100 m^2.
3) The formula for the area of a rectangle is: Area = length x width
4) Substituting the values we know, we get: 100 = 4w x w
5) Simplifying, we get: 100 = 4w^2
6) Solving for w, we get: w^2 = 25
7) Taking the square root of both sides, we get: w = 5
8) Since the length is 4 times the width, the length is: 4 x 5 = 20

Answer: 20
