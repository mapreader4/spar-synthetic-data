Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The leak drips 3 drops per minute
* Each drop is 20 ml
* The pot holds 3 liters

First, we need to convert the pot's capacity from liters to milliliters:
* 3 liters = 3,000 ml

Next, we need to calculate how many drops it will take to fill the pot:
* 3,000 ml / 20 ml per drop = 150 drops

Finally, we can calculate how long it will take to fill the pot:
* 150 drops / 3 drops per minute = 50 minutes

Answer: 50
