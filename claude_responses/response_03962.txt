Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lucas went to the store with $20
* He needed to buy 3 avocados
* Each avocado costs $2
* To calculate the total cost of the 3 avocados:
    - 3 avocados x $2 per avocado = $6 total
* To calculate the change Lucas brings home:
    - Lucas started with $20
    - He spent $6 on the avocados
    - So the change he brings home is $20 - $6 = $14
