Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Robi contributed $4000 to start the business.
2) Rudy contributed 1/4 more money than Robi. This means Rudy contributed $4000 + (1/4 * $4000) = $5000.
3) The total amount contributed to start the business is $4000 + $5000 = $9000.
4) They made a profit of 20% of the total amount. This means the profit is 20% of $9000, which is 0.20 * $9000 = $1800.
5) They decided to share the profits equally. This means Robi and Rudy each got half of the $1800 profit, which is $900 each.

Answer: $900
