Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pauline's dress cost $30
* Jean's dress was $10 less than Pauline's dress, so Jean's dress cost $20
* Ida's dress was $30 more than Jean's dress, so Ida's dress cost $50
* Patty's dress was $10 more than Ida's dress, so Patty's dress cost $60

Now, to find the total amount spent on dresses by all the ladies, we add up the costs of each dress:
* Pauline's dress: $30
* Jean's dress: $20
* Ida's dress: $50
* Patty's dress: $60

Total amount spent = $30 + $20 + $50 + $60 = $160

Answer: $160
