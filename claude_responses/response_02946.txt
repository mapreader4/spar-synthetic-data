* The movie tickets cost $8 per person
* There are two sisters, so the total cost of the tickets is:
    * 2 tickets x $8 per ticket = $16
* The sisters brought $25 with them
* To calculate the change they will receive, we take the amount they brought ($25) and subtract the total cost of the tickets ($16):
    * $25 - $16 = $9
