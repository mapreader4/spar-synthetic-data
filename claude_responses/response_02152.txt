Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Aunt Angela has 70 jellybeans in a jar.
2) She wants to divide them equally among her 3 nephews and 2 nieces.
3) To find the number of jellybeans each nephew or niece will receive, we need to divide the total number of jellybeans by the total number of recipients.
4) The total number of recipients is 3 nephews + 2 nieces = 5 people.
5) 70 jellybeans / 5 people = 14 jellybeans per person.

Answer: 14
