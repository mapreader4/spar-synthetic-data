Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) A dime has the same value as 10 pennies, so 10 dimes is equivalent to 100 pennies.
2) A nickel has the same value as 5 pennies, so 10 nickels is equivalent to 50 pennies.
3) In total, Grace has 10 dimes and 10 nickels.
4) The value of the 10 dimes is 100 pennies.
5) The value of the 10 nickels is 50 pennies.
6) Adding the value of the dimes and nickels, we get 100 + 50 = 150 pennies.
