Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* June's mom pays her 1 cent for every cloverleaf she picks
* June picks a total of 200 clovers
* 75% of the clovers have 3 petals
* 24% of the clovers have 2 petals
* 1% of the clovers have 4 petals

First, let's calculate how many clovers have 3 petals:
* 75% of 200 clovers = 0.75 * 200 = 150 clovers with 3 petals

Next, let's calculate how many clovers have 2 petals:
* 24% of 200 clovers = 0.24 * 200 = 48 clovers with 2 petals

Finally, let's calculate how many clovers have 4 petals:
* 1% of 200 clovers = 0.01 * 200 = 2 clovers with 4 petals

Now, we can calculate the total number of cents June earns:
* 150 clovers with 3 petals x 1 cent = 150 cents
* 48 clovers with 2 petals x 1 cent = 48 cents
* 2 clovers with 4 petals x 1 cent = 2 cents
* Total cents earned = 150 + 48 + 2 = 200 cents

Answer: 200 cents
