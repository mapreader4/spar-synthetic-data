Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mckenna starts her day at 8:00 a.m.
* She works in her office up to 11:00 a.m., which is 3 hours (11:00 - 8:00 = 3)
* She then joins her team of developers at the conference room to talk about projects up to 13:00, which is 2 hours (13:00 - 11:00 = 2)
* After that, she works for another two hours (13:00 - 15:00 = 2)
* So the total time Mckenna stays at work is:
  - 3 hours in the office
  - 2 hours in the conference room
  - 2 more hours of work
* Adding these up, the total time Mckenna stays at work is 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 hours.
