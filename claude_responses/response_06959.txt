Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Debelyn had 20 dolls before giving Andrena 2 dolls, so now Debelyn has 20 - 2 = 18 dolls.
* Christel had 24 dolls before giving Andrena 5 dolls, so now Christel has 24 - 5 = 19 dolls.
* Andrena now has 2 more dolls than Christel, so Andrena has 19 + 2 = 21 dolls.
* To find how many more dolls Andrena has now than Debelyn, we subtract Debelyn's dolls from Andrena's dolls:
* Andrena's dolls: 21
* Debelyn's dolls: 18
* 21 - 18 = 3
