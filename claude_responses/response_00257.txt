Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each. So, the total revenue from the cookies is:
   40 cookies x $0.8 per cookie = $32

2. Hannah sold 30 cupcakes for $2 each. So, the total revenue from the cupcakes is:
   30 cupcakes x $2 per cupcake = $60

3. The total revenue from the cookies and cupcakes is:
   $32 + $60 = $92

4. Hannah used the money to buy 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each. So, the total cost of the measuring spoons is:
   2 sets x $6.5 per set = $13

5. The amount of money Hannah has left is the total revenue minus the total cost of the measuring spoons:
   $92 - $13 = $79

Answer: $79
