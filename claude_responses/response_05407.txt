Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jill studies for 2 hours on the first day
* On the second day, she doubles the amount of time she studied the previous day, which is 2 hours. So, she studies for 4 hours on the second day.
* On the third day, she studies for 1 hour less than the previous day, which was 4 hours. So, she studies for 3 hours on the third day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jill studied over the 3 days:
* Day 1: 2 hours = 120 minutes
* Day 2: 4 hours = 240 minutes
* Day 3: 3 hours = 180 minutes

Adding these together, we get:
* Total minutes studied = 120 + 240 + 180 = 540 minutes

Answer: 540
