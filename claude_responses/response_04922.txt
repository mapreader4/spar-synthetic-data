Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James sells the house for $500,000.
2) He sells it for 20% over market value, which means the market value of the house is $500,000 / 1.2 = $416,667.
3) The selling price of the house is $500,000.
4) The revenue from the sale is $500,000.
5) James splits the revenue with his 3 brothers, so each person gets 1/4 of the revenue.
6) 1/4 of $500,000 is $125,000.
7) Taxes take away 10% of the $125,000, which is $12,500.
8) Therefore, each person gets $125,000 - $12,500 = $112,500.

Answer: 112,500
