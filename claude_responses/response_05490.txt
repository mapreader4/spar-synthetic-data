Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Junior has 16 rabbits
* On Monday, he bought 6 toys for his rabbits
* On Wednesday, he bought twice as many toys as he did on Monday
* On Friday, he bought four times as many toys as he did on Monday
* On the next day (Saturday), he bought half as many toys as he did on Wednesday

First, let's calculate the number of toys he bought each day:
* Monday: 6 toys
* Wednesday: 2 x 6 = 12 toys
* Friday: 4 x 6 = 24 toys
* Saturday: 1/2 x 12 = 6 toys

Now, let's add up the total number of toys he bought:
* Total toys = 6 + 12 + 24 + 6 = 48 toys

Finally, to find how many toys each rabbit would have if they were split evenly, we divide the total number of toys by the number of rabbits:
* Toys per rabbit = 48 / 16 = 3
