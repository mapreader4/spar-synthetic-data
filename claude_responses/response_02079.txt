Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kristy baked an unknown number of cookies
* She ate 2 cookies
* She gave her brother 1 cookie
* Her first friend took 3 cookies
* Her second and third friends took 5 cookies each
* There are 6 cookies left

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies that were taken:
* Kristy ate 2 cookies
* Her brother took 1 cookie
* Her first friend took 3 cookies
* Her second and third friends took 5 cookies each, so 10 cookies total
* That's a total of 2 + 1 + 3 + 10 = 16 cookies taken

We know that there are 6 cookies left, so the total number of cookies Kristy baked must be:
* 16 cookies taken + 6 cookies left = 22 cookies baked

Answer: 22
