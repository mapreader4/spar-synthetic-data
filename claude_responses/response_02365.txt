Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first dig site is 352 years more recent than the second dig site.
* The third dig site is 3700 years older than the first dig site.
* The fourth dig site is twice as old as the third dig site.
* The fourth dig site is dated 8400 BC.

First, let's find the date of the third dig site:
* The fourth dig site is dated 8400 BC.
* The fourth dig site is twice as old as the third dig site.
* So, the third dig site is dated 8400 BC / 2 = 4200 BC.

Now, let's find the date of the first dig site:
* The third dig site is 3700 years older than the first dig site.
* So, the first dig site is dated 4200 BC - 3700 years = 500 BC.

Finally, let's find the date of the second dig site:
* The first dig site is 352 years more recent than the second dig site.
* So, the second dig site is dated 500 BC + 352 years = 852 BC.

Answer: 852 BC
