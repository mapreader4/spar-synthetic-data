Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The tree was 100 meters tall at the end of 2017.
* The tree will grow 10% more than its previous height each year.
* To calculate the growth from 2017 to 2018:
  * The tree's height in 2018 = 100 meters + (100 meters * 10%) = 100 meters + 10 meters = 110 meters.
* To calculate the growth from 2018 to 2019:
  * The tree's height in 2019 = 110 meters + (110 meters * 10%) = 110 meters + 11 meters = 121 meters.
* Therefore, the total growth of the tree from the end of 2017 to the end of 2019 is:
  * 121 meters - 100 meters = 21 meters.

Answer: 21 meters.
