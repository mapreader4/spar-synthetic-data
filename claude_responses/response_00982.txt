Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Frank bakes 2 trays of cookies per day
* Each tray makes 12 cookies
* So, in one day, Frank bakes 2 * 12 = 24 cookies
* Frank bakes for 6 days
* So, the total number of cookies baked is 24 * 6 = 144 cookies
* Frank eats 1 cookie per day for 6 days, so he eats 6 cookies
* Ted eats 4 cookies on the sixth day
* So, the total number of cookies eaten is 6 + 4 = 10 cookies
* The total number of cookies baked is 144
* The total number of cookies eaten is 10
* Therefore, the number of cookies left when Ted leaves is 144 - 10 = 134 cookies

Answer: 134
