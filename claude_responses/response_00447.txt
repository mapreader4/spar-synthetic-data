Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Megan has read 32 books this year.

2. Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read.
   * Megan has read 32 books
   * 1/4 of 32 is 32 / 4 = 8
   * Therefore, Kelcie has read 8 books.

3. Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read.
   * Kelcie has read 8 books
   * Twice the number of books that Kelcie has read is 8 x 2 = 16
   * Greg has read 9 more than 16, which is 16 + 9 = 25
   * Therefore, Greg has read 25 books.

Now, to find the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg, we add up their individual amounts:
* Megan: 32 books
* Kelcie: 8 books
* Greg: 25 books
* Total: 32 + 8 + 25 = 65 books

Answer: 65
