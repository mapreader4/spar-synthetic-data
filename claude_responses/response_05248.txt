Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John's original squat weight was 135 pounds.
2) After training, he increased that by 265 pounds, so his new squat weight is 135 + 265 = 400 pounds.
3) He then gets a magical strength-increasing bracer that increases his strength by an additional 600%.
4) To calculate the 600% increase, we take the original weight of 400 pounds and multiply it by 7 (100% + 600% = 700%, which is 7 times the original).
5) 400 pounds x 7 = 2,800 pounds.

Answer: 2,800 pounds.
