Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Edith has 80 novels stuffed on her schoolbook shelf
* The number of writing books she has stuffed in her suitcase is twice the number of novels she has on her shelf
* To find the total number of novels and writing books, we need to add the number of novels and the number of writing books

First, let's find the number of writing books:
* The number of writing books is twice the number of novels
* So, the number of writing books = 2 x 80 = 160

Now, let's find the total number of novels and writing books:
* Total number of novels and writing books = 80 + 160 = 240

Answer: 240
