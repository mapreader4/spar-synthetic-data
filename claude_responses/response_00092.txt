Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sally makes $6 per day
* Bob makes $4 per day
* They both save half of what they've earned

For Sally:
* Sally earns $6 per day
* In a year, there are 365 days
* So, Sally earns $6 x 365 = $2,190 in a year
* Sally saves half of that, which is $2,190 / 2 = $1,095

For Bob:
* Bob earns $4 per day
* In a year, there are 365 days
* So, Bob earns $4 x 365 = $1,460 in a year
* Bob saves half of that, which is $1,460 / 2 = $730

Now, to find the total amount of money they will have saved for their trip:
* Sally saved $1,095
* Bob saved $730
* Total saved = $1,095 + $730 = $1,825

Answer: $1,825
