Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matinee tickets cost $5 each, and they sold 200 of them
* So the total revenue from matinee tickets is:
200 tickets x $5 per ticket = $1,000

* Evening tickets cost $12 each, and they sold 300 of them
* So the total revenue from evening tickets is:
300 tickets x $12 per ticket = $3,600

* 3D tickets cost $20 each, and they sold 100 of them
* So the total revenue from 3D tickets is:
100 tickets x $20 per ticket = $2,000

* To calculate the total revenue, we add up the revenue from each ticket type:
$1,000 + $3,600 + $2,000 = $6,600

Answer: $6,600
