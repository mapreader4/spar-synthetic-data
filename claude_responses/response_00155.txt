Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Colby harvested a total of 60 kilograms of mangoes.
2) He sold 20 kilograms to the market.
3) He sold the remaining half to his community.
4) Each kilogram contains 8 mangoes.
5) To find the number of mangoes he still has, we need to calculate the amount of mangoes he has left after the sales.
6) First, let's calculate the amount of mangoes he sold to the market: 20 kilograms x 8 mangoes/kilogram = 160 mangoes.
7) Next, let's calculate the amount of mangoes he sold to his community: (60 kilograms - 20 kilograms) / 2 = 20 kilograms, which is 20 kilograms x 8 mangoes/kilogram = 160 mangoes.
8) Finally, we can calculate the number of mangoes he still has: 60 kilograms x 8 mangoes/kilogram - 160 mangoes - 160 mangoes = 160 mangoes.

Answer: 160 mangoes.
