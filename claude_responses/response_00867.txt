Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Bob runs 6 miles per hour, and Jim runs 9 miles per hour.
2) Bob has a 1 mile head-start.
3) We need to find the time it takes for Jim to catch up to Bob.
4) Let's define the variables:
   - t = time in hours for Jim to catch up to Bob
   - d = distance Jim travels to catch up to Bob
5) Since Bob has a 1 mile head-start, the distance Jim needs to travel is 1 mile.
6) The distance Jim travels in t hours is 9t miles.
7) The distance Bob travels in t hours is 6t miles.
8) Since Jim catches up to Bob, the distance traveled by both is the same, so:
   9t = 6t + 1
   3t = 1
   t = 1/3 hours
9) Converting to minutes:
   1/3 hours = 20 minutes
Answer: 20 minutes
