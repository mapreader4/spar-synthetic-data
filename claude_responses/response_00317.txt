Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class
* She spends 4 hours per day working on homework
* There are 7 days in a week
* So, she spends 4 hours x 7 days = 28 hours per week on homework
* She spends 8 hours per day sleeping
* There are 7 days in a week
* So, she spends 8 hours x 7 days = 56 hours per week sleeping
* She works part-time 20 hours per week

Now, let's add up the total hours she spends on these activities:
* 18 hours in class + 28 hours on homework + 56 hours sleeping + 20 hours working part-time
* = 18 + 28 + 56 + 20
* = 122 hours per week

There are 168 hours in a week (24 hours x 7 days).
So, the number of hours left over is:
* 168 hours - 122 hours
* = 46 hours

Answer: 46
