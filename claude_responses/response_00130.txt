Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Ali started with 180 seashells.
2) He then gave away 40 seashells to his friends, so he had 180 - 40 = 140 seashells left.
3) He then gave away 30 seashells to his brothers, so he had 140 - 30 = 110 seashells left.
4) He then sold half of the remaining seashells, which means he sold 110 / 2 = 55 seashells.
5) Therefore, the number of seashells he had left is 110 - 55 = 55 seashells.

Answer: 55
