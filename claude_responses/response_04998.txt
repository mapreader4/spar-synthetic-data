Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tabitha started adding a new hair color when she was 15 years old, which was the year she added her second hair color.
* In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair.
* This means that in the current year, Tabitha has 5 different hair colors (8 colors - 3 years = 5 colors).
* Since Tabitha started adding a new color when she was 15, and she currently has 5 colors, that means 5 years have passed since she was 15.
* Therefore, Tabitha's current age is 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Answer: 20
