Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carmen sees 50 trucks and 40 cars
* Half the trucks are red, so 50 * 0.5 = 25 red trucks
* 20% of the trucks are black, so 50 * 0.2 = 10 black trucks
* The remaining trucks must be white, so 50 - 25 - 10 = 15 white trucks
* The total number of vehicles is 50 trucks + 40 cars = 90 vehicles
* The percentage of white trucks is (15 white trucks) / (90 total vehicles) = 0.1667 or 16.67%
* Rounding to the nearest integer, the answer is:

Answer: 17
