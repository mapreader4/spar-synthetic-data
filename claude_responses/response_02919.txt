Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Diving Club offers 2 beginning diving classes on weekdays
* The Diving Club offers 4 beginning diving classes on each day of the weekend (Saturday and Sunday)
* Each class has room for 5 people

To calculate the total number of people who can take classes in 3 weeks, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of classes in 3 weeks
2. Multiply the number of classes by the number of people per class

Number of classes in 3 weeks:
* Weekdays: 2 classes per day x 5 days per week x 3 weeks = 30 classes
* Weekends: 4 classes per day x 2 days per week x 3 weeks = 24 classes
* Total classes in 3 weeks: 30 + 24 = 54 classes

Number of people who can take classes in 3 weeks:
* 54 classes x 5 people per class = 270 people

Answer: 270
