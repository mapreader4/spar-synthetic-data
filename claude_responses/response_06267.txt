Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mia spends 1/5 of her day watching TV.
2) That means she spends 4/5 of her day on other activities.
3) She then spends 1/4 of the remaining 4/5 of her day studying.
4) So, the fraction of her day spent studying is 1/4 * 4/5 = 1/5.
5) Assuming Mia's day is 24 hours long, or 1440 minutes:
6) 1/5 of 1440 minutes = 288 minutes.

Answer: 288 minutes.
