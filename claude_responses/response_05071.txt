Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The football club starts with a balance of $100 million.
2) The club then sells 2 players at $10 million each, so the club receives $20 million from the sales.
3) The club then buys 4 players at $15 million each, so the club spends $60 million on the new players.
4) To calculate the final balance, we start with the initial $100 million, add the $20 million from the sales, and subtract the $60 million spent on the new players.

$100 million + $20 million - $60 million = $60 million

Answer: $60 million
