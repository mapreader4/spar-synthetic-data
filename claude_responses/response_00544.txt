Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Elise buys a 15kg bag of dog food.
2) She then buys another 10kg bag of dog food.
3) After these two purchases, she now has 40kg of dog food.
4) To find how much dog food she already had, we can subtract the two bags she just bought from the total amount she now has.
5) 40kg - 15kg - 10kg = 15kg
Therefore, Elise already had 15kg of dog food before her latest purchases.

Answer: 15
