Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mikail's birthday is tomorrow
* He will be 3 times older than he was when he was 3 years old
* When he was 3 years old, he was 3 years old
* So, if he is 3 times older than he was when he was 3, that means he is now 3 x 3 = 9 years old
* His parents give him $5 for every year old he is
* Since he is 9 years old, they will give him 9 x $5 = $45

Answer: $45
