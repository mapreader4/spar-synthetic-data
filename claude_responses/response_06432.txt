Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marco has $24 and Mary has $15.
2) If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, that means he gives her $12.
3) After Marco gives Mary $12, he will have $24 - $12 = $12 left.
4) After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27.
5) Now, Mary spends $5, so she has $27 - $5 = $22 left.
6) The difference between Mary's money ($22) and Marco's money ($12) is $22 - $12 = $10.
