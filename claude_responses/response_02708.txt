Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In January, Ofelia saved $10.
* The challenge requires her to save twice the amount she saved the previous month.
* So in February, she would save 2 x $10 = $20.
* In March, she would save 2 x $20 = $40.
* In April, she would save 2 x $40 = $80.
* In May, she would save 2 x $80 = $160.

Answer: 160
