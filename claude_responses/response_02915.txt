Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Adam is currently 8 years old
* Tom is currently 12 years old
* We want to find how many years it will take for their combined age to be 44 years old

To do this, we need to find the total age of Adam and Tom in the future, and then determine how many years it will take to reach that total.

The total age of Adam and Tom currently is:
* 8 + 12 = 20 years old

We want their combined age to be 44 years old in the future.
* 44 - 20 = 24 years

Therefore, it will take 24 years for their combined age to be 44 years old.

Answer: 24
