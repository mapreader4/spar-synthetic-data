Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Robbie eats 3 cups of rice in the morning, 2 cups in the afternoon, and 5 cups in the evening.
* So, the total number of cups of rice Robbie eats per day is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 cups.
* Each cup of rice has 10 grams of fat.
* Therefore, the total grams of fat Robbie gets per day is 10 cups x 10 grams/cup = 100 grams.
* There are 7 days in a week.
* So, the total grams of fat Robbie gets in a week is 100 grams/day x 7 days = 700 grams.

Answer: 700 grams.
