Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shaniqua makes $12 for every haircut
* Shaniqua makes $25 for every style
* Shaniqua gave 8 haircuts
* Shaniqua gave 5 styles

To calculate the total amount of money Shaniqua made, we need to:
1. Calculate the money made from the haircuts
2. Calculate the money made from the styles
3. Add the two amounts together

Step 1: Calculate the money made from the haircuts
* 8 haircuts x $12 per haircut = $96

Step 2: Calculate the money made from the styles
* 5 styles x $25 per style = $125

Step 3: Add the two amounts together
* $96 + $125 = $221

Answer: $221
