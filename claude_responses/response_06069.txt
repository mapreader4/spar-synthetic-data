Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mia can decorate 2 dozen (24) eggs per hour
* Billy can decorate 10 eggs per hour
* They need to decorate 170 eggs in total

First, let's calculate how long it would take Mia to decorate all 170 eggs on her own:
* Mia can decorate 24 eggs per hour
* 170 eggs / 24 eggs per hour = 7.08 hours

Now, let's calculate how long it would take Billy to decorate all 170 eggs on his own:
* Billy can decorate 10 eggs per hour
* 170 eggs / 10 eggs per hour = 17 hours

When they work together, their combined rate is:
* Mia's rate + Billy's rate = 24 eggs/hour + 10 eggs/hour = 34 eggs/hour

Now, we can calculate how long it will take them to decorate all 170 eggs working together:
* 170 eggs / 34 eggs per hour = 5 hours

Answer: 5 hours
