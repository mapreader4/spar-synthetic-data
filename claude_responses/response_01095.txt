Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ignatius owns 4 bicycles
* Each bicycle has 2 tires
* So Ignatius's bikes have a total of 4 * 2 = 8 tires

* The friend's cycles have 3 times as many tires as Ignatius's bikes
* So the friend's cycles have a total of 3 * 8 = 24 tires

* The friend has 1 unicycle, which has 1 tire
* The friend has 1 tricycle, which has 3 tires
* The remaining tires must be from bicycles

* To find the number of bicycles the friend has, we need to subtract the tires from the unicycle and tricycle from the total tires:
* 24 tires - 1 tire (unicycle) - 3 tires (tricycle) = 20 tires
* Since each bicycle has 2 tires, the number of bicycles the friend has is 20 / 2 = 10 bicycles

Answer: 10
