Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 7 trees in the park
* Each tree has 3 blackbirds
* So the total number of blackbirds is 7 trees x 3 blackbirds per tree = 21 blackbirds
* There are also 13 magpies roaming around the park
* To get the total number of birds, we add the blackbirds and the magpies:
* 21 blackbirds + 13 magpies = 34 birds

Answer: 34
