Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bowl contains apples, pears, and bananas
* There are two more pears than apples
* There are three more bananas than pears
* The total number of pieces of fruit in the bowl is 19

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of apples
* Then the number of pears = x + 2
* And the number of bananas = (x + 2) + 3 = x + 5

Now we can set up an equation to solve for the number of bananas:
* x + (x + 2) + (x + 5) = 19
* 3x + 7 = 19
* 3x = 12
* x = 4

Therefore, the number of bananas in the bowl is:
* x + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9

Answer: 9
