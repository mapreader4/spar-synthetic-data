Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Big boxes contain 7 dolls each
* There are 5 big boxes
* So the number of dolls in the big boxes is: 5 big boxes x 7 dolls per box = 35 dolls
* Small boxes contain 4 dolls each
* There are 9 small boxes
* So the number of dolls in the small boxes is: 9 small boxes x 4 dolls per box = 36 dolls
* To get the total number of dolls, we add the dolls in the big boxes and the dolls in the small boxes:
* 35 dolls + 36 dolls = 71 dolls

Answer: 71
