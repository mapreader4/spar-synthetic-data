Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Tilly needs to sell 100 bags at $10 per bag to make $300 in profit.
2) The total revenue from selling 100 bags at $10 per bag is 100 * $10 = $1,000.
3) The total profit is $300.
4) To find the cost per bag, we need to subtract the total profit from the total revenue, and then divide the result by the number of bags.
5) Total cost = Total revenue - Total profit
   = $1,000 - $300 = $700
6) Cost per bag = Total cost / Number of bags
   = $700 / 100 = $7 per bag.

Answer: $7
