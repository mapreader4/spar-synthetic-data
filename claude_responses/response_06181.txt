Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Antonia has a 7-day pill box she wants to fill
* She buys 5 different supplements
* 3 of the bottles have 120 pills each
* 2 of the bottles have 30 pills each
* She wants to fill her pillbox with one pill of each supplement for 2 weeks

First, let's calculate the total number of pills she has:
* 3 bottles with 120 pills each = 3 x 120 = 360 pills
* 2 bottles with 30 pills each = 2 x 30 = 60 pills
* Total pills = 360 + 60 = 420 pills

Now, let's calculate how many pills she will use in 2 weeks:
* 1 pill of each supplement per day
* 5 pills per day
* 5 pills per day x 7 days per week = 35 pills per week
* 35 pills per week x 2 weeks = 70 pills used

Finally, we can calculate the number of pills left:
* 420 pills - 70 pills used = 350 pills left

Answer: 350
