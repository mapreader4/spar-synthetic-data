Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Last year, the school library purchased 50 new books
* This year, the library purchased 3 times as many books as last year
* Last year, the library had 100 books before purchasing new books

First, let's calculate how many books the library purchased this year:
* This year's purchases = 3 x 50 = 150 books

Now, let's calculate the total number of books in the library:
* Before last year's purchases, the library had 100 books
* Last year, the library purchased 50 new books
* This year, the library purchased 150 new books
* Total books in the library = 100 + 50 + 150 = 300 books

Answer: 300
