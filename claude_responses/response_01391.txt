Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Susan is 15 years old
* Arthur is 2 years older than Susan, so Arthur is 15 + 2 = 17 years old
* Bob is 11 years old
* Tom is 3 years younger than Bob, so Tom is 11 - 3 = 8 years old

Now, we can add up the ages of all four family members:
Susan: 15 years old
Arthur: 17 years old
Bob: 11 years old
Tom: 8 years old

Total age of all four family members:
15 + 17 + 11 + 8 = 51 years old

Answer: 51
