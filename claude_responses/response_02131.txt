Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We have a square with 2-inch sides.
2) The square has an area of 2 inches x 2 inches = 4 square inches.
3) We want to fit as many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches inside the square.
4) The area of each right triangle is 1/2 * 2 inches * 2 inches = 2 square inches.
5) To find how many right triangles can fit inside the square, we divide the area of the square (4 square inches) by the area of each right triangle (2 square inches).
6) 4 square inches / 2 square inches per triangle = 2 triangles.
