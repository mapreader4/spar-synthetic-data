Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each carton holds 3 widgets
* Each carton is 4 inches wide, 4 inches long, and 5 inches tall
* The shipping box is 20 inches wide, 20 inches long, and 20 inches high

To calculate the number of widgets in each shipping box, we need to first find out how many cartons can fit in the shipping box.

The width of the shipping box is 20 inches, and each carton is 4 inches wide. So we can fit 20 / 4 = 5 cartons across the width.
The length of the shipping box is 20 inches, and each carton is 4 inches long. So we can fit 20 / 4 = 5 cartons along the length.
The height of the shipping box is 20 inches, and each carton is 5 inches tall. So we can fit 20 / 5 = 4 cartons in height.

In total, we can fit 5 x 5 x 4 = 100 cartons in the shipping box.

Since each carton holds 3 widgets, the total number of widgets in the shipping box is:
100 cartons x 3 widgets per carton = 300 widgets.

Answer: 300
