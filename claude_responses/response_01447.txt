To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Mary and Ann to slide down their respective hills, and then calculate the difference between their trip times.

Given information:
- Mary's hill is 630 feet long, and she slides at a speed of 90 feet/minute.
- Ann's hill is 800 feet long, and she slides at a speed of 40 feet/minute.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for Mary to slide down her hill.
Time taken by Mary = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Mary = 630 feet / 90 feet/minute = 7 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Ann to slide down her hill.
Time taken by Ann = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Ann = 800 feet / 40 feet/minute = 20 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Ann's and Mary's trip times.
Difference in trip time = Ann's trip time - Mary's trip time
Difference in trip time = 20 minutes - 7 minutes = 13 minutes

Answer: 13 minutes
