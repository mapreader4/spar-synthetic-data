Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joe sells cookies for 20% more than it costs to make them
* This means the selling price of each cookie is 120% of the cost to make it
* Joe sold 50 cookies and earned $60 in total
* To find the cost to make each cookie, we can use the following equation:
* Selling price = 1.2 x Cost to make
* $60 / 50 cookies = 1.2 x Cost to make
* Solving for the cost to make:
* $60 / 50 = 1.2 x Cost to make
* Cost to make = $60 / (50 x 1.2)
* Cost to make = $1
