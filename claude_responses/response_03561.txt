Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The novel has half as many pages as the history book.
2) The history book has 300 pages.
3) Therefore, the novel has 300 / 2 = 150 pages.
4) The science book has 4 times the amount of pages as the novel.
5) Therefore, the science book has 4 * 150 = 600 pages.

Answer: 600
