Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peter bought 4 new notebooks for school
* 2 of them are green, 1 is black, and 1 is pink
* The total cost was $45
* The black notebook cost $15
* The pink notebook cost $10

Now, we need to find the cost of the green notebooks.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the black and pink notebooks:
* Black notebook: $15
* Pink notebook: $10
* Total cost of black and pink notebooks: $15 + $10 = $25

Now, we can subtract the cost of the black and pink notebooks from the total cost to find the cost of the green notebooks:
* Total cost: $45
* Cost of black and pink notebooks: $25
* Cost of green notebooks: $45 - $25 = $20

Since there are 2 green notebooks, we can divide the total cost of the green notebooks by 2 to find the cost of each green notebook:
* Cost of each green notebook: $20 / 2 = $10

Answer: $10
