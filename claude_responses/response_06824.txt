Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Simone ate 1/2 of an apple each day for 16 days.
   * Total amount of apples eaten by Simone = 1/2 x 16 = 8 apples

2. Lauri ate 1/3 of an apple each day for 15 days.
   * Total amount of apples eaten by Lauri = 1/3 x 15 = 5 apples

3. To find the total number of apples eaten by both girls, we add the amounts eaten by each:
   * Total apples eaten = Simone's apples + Lauri's apples
   * Total apples eaten = 8 + 5 = 13 apples

Answer: 13 apples
