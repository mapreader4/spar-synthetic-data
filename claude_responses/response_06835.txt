To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for a skier to complete one cycle of riding the lift up and skiing down the mountain, and then determine how many times they can complete this cycle within 2 hours.

Given information:
- It takes 15 minutes to ride the lift from the bottom to the top of the mountain.
- It takes 5 minutes to ski back down the mountain.

Step 1: Calculate the total time for one cycle of riding the lift up and skiing down the mountain.
Time to ride the lift up + Time to ski down = Total time for one cycle
15 minutes + 5 minutes = 20 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the number of cycles that can be completed in 2 hours.
2 hours = 120 minutes
Number of cycles = 120 minutes / 20 minutes per cycle = 6 cycles

Therefore, the most number of times a person can ski down the mountain in 2 hours is 6 times.

Answer: 6
