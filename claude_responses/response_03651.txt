Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Steve has 25 socks in total.
2) He has 4 pairs of matching socks, which means he has 8 socks that match.
3) The remaining socks are mismatching.
4) To find the number of mismatching socks, we take the total number of socks (25) and subtract the number of matching socks (8).
5) 25 - 8 = 17 mismatching socks.

Answer: 17
