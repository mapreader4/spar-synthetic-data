Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gretchen's local ice cream shop offers 100 different flavors
* 2 years ago, she was able to try 1/4 of the flavors
* 1/4 of 100 is 25 flavors
* Last year, she was able to try double the amount she tried 2 years ago
* Double of 25 is 50 flavors
* So, in total, she has tried 25 + 50 = 75 flavors
* To have tried all 100 flavors, she needs to try the remaining 100 - 75 = 25 flavors

Answer: 25
