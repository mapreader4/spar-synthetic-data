Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John rents the apartment for $900 per month
* He sublets the apartment to 3 people
* Each subletter pays $400 per month
* To calculate the profit per month:
    - Rental income from subletters: 3 x $400 = $1,200 per month
    - Rent paid by John: $900 per month
    - Profit per month: $1,200 - $900 = $300 per month
* To calculate the profit in a year:
    - Profit per month: $300
    - Months in a year: 12
    - Yearly profit: $300 x 12 = $3,600

Answer: $3,600
