Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We have 400 adults and 200 children attending the Broadway show.
2) The price of an adult ticket is twice that of a child's ticket.
3) Let's represent the price of a child's ticket as x.
4) Then the price of an adult ticket is 2x.
5) The total amount collected is $16,000.
6) The total revenue can be calculated as: (400 * 2x) + (200 * x) = 16,000
7) Simplifying this equation, we get: 800x + 200x = 16,000
8) Solving for x, we get: 1000x = 16,000
9) x = $16.
