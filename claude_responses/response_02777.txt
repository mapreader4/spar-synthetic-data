Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee in an hour
* Brayan drinks twice as much coffee as Ivory
* So, if Brayan drinks 4 cups in an hour, Ivory must drink 2 cups in an hour
* They need to work for 5 hours
* In 5 hours, Brayan will drink:
    - 4 cups per hour x 5 hours = 20 cups
* In 5 hours, Ivory will drink:
    - 2 cups per hour x 5 hours = 10 cups
* The total number of cups of coffee they drink together in 5 hours is:
    - Brayan's cups (20) + Ivory's cups (10) = 30 cups

Answer: 30
