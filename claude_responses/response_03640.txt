Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Arthur has 2,000 basketball cards
2) Each card is worth 5 cents
3) So the total value of his basketball card collection is:
2,000 cards x $0.05 per card = $100
4) Comic books cost $6 each
5) Arthur can buy as many comic books as he can with the $100 he gets from selling his cards
6) $100 / $6 per comic book = 16.67 comic books
7) Since Arthur can only buy whole comic books, he can buy 16 comic books
8) The total cost of 16 comic books is: 16 x $6 = $96
9) The amount of money Arthur has leftover is:
$100 (from selling the cards) - $96 (for the comic books) = $4
