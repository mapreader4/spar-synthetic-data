Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tony puts $1,000 in a savings account for 1 year.
2. The account earns 20% interest. To calculate the interest earned:
   * Interest = Principal x Interest Rate
   * Interest = $1,000 x 0.20 = $200
3. The total amount in the account after the first year is:
   * Total = Principal + Interest
   * Total = $1,000 + $200 = $1,200
4. Tony then takes out half the money to buy a new TV. The amount he takes out is:
   * Amount Taken Out = $1,200 / 2 = $600
5. The remaining amount in the account is:
   * Remaining Amount = $1,200 - $600 = $600
6. The next year, the remaining $600 earns 15% interest. To calculate the interest earned:
   * Interest = Principal x Interest Rate
   * Interest = $600 x 0.15 = $90
7. The total amount in the account after the second year is:
   * Total = Principal + Interest
   * Total = $600 + $90 = $690

Answer: $690
