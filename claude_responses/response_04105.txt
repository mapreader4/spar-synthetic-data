Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Andrew ate 14 donuts.
* On Tuesday, Andrew ate half as many donuts as he did on Monday. So, on Tuesday he ate 14 / 2 = 7 donuts.
* On Wednesday, Andrew ate 4 times as many donuts as he did on Monday. So, on Wednesday he ate 14 * 4 = 56 donuts.

Now, to find the total number of donuts Andrew ate in the three days, we add up the number of donuts he ate each day:
* Total donuts = 14 + 7 + 56 = 77

Answer: 77
