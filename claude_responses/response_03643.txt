Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The bakery has 8 indoor tables and 12 outdoor tables.
2) Each indoor table has 3 chairs.
3) Each outdoor table has 3 chairs.
4) To calculate the total number of chairs, we need to find the number of chairs for the indoor tables and the outdoor tables, then add them together.
5) For the indoor tables, there are 8 tables, and each has 3 chairs. So the total number of chairs for the indoor tables is 8 * 3 = 24.
6) For the outdoor tables, there are 12 tables, and each has 3 chairs. So the total number of chairs for the outdoor tables is 12 * 3 = 36.
7) The total number of chairs is the sum of the indoor chairs and the outdoor chairs: 24 + 36 = 60.

Answer: 60
