Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Erika and her 3 siblings are drawing with chalk
* 3 more friends join them
* So the total number of people drawing is 7 (Erika, her 3 siblings, and 3 friends)
* Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk while counting
* Erika's mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk
* Now there is enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each

To find the original number of pieces of chalk Erika and her siblings had, we can use the following logic:
* If there are 7 people and each person has 3 pieces of chalk, then the total number of pieces of chalk is 7 * 3 = 21
* Erika lost 2 pieces of chalk, so the original number of pieces of chalk was 21 + 2 = 23
* Erika's mom brought out 12 more pieces of chalk, so the original number of pieces of chalk was 23 - 12 = 11

Answer: 11
