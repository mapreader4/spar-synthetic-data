Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Tom takes 2 pills every day before bed
* He needs to go to the doctor every 6 months to get a new prescription
* A visit to the doctor costs $400
* The medication costs $5 per pill
* Insurance covers 80% of the medication cost

First, let's calculate the cost of the medication per year:
* Tom takes 2 pills per day
* That's 2 pills x 365 days = 730 pills per year
* The medication costs $5 per pill, but insurance covers 80% of that cost
* So the cost per pill after insurance is $5 x (1 - 0.8) = $1
* The total cost of the medication per year is 730 pills x $1 per pill = $730

Next, let's calculate the cost of the doctor visits per year:
* Tom needs to go to the doctor every 6 months
* That's 2 visits per year
* Each visit costs $400
* The total cost of the doctor visits per year is 2 visits x $400 per visit = $800

Finally, let's add up the total cost per year:
* Medication cost per year: $730
* Doctor visit cost per year: $800
* Total cost per year: $730 + $800 = $1,530

Answer: $1,530
