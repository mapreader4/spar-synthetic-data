Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hermione, Luna, and Celestia have a combined total of 83 spelling badges.
* Hermione has 14 spelling badges.
* Luna has 17 spelling badges.
* To find how many spelling badges Celestia has, we need to subtract the number of badges Hermione and Luna have from the total number of badges.
* Hermione has 14 badges and Luna has 17 badges, so together they have 14 + 17 = 31 badges.
* The total number of badges is 83, so we subtract the 31 badges that Hermione and Luna have to find how many Celestia has.
* 83 - 31 = 52

Answer: 52
