Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The money was shared between Sam's three cousins: Sandra, Amy, and Ruth.
2) The ratio of the money shared was 2:1:3, respectively.
3) We know that Amy got $50.
4) Since the ratio is 2:1:3, we can set up the following equation:
   * Let x = the amount Sandra got
   * Amy got $50, so the ratio for her is 1
   * Ruth got 3 times the amount Sandra got, so 3x
5) The total ratio is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
6) Therefore, the equation is: 
   * 2x + 50 + 3x = 6 * 50
   * 5x = 250
   * x = 50
7) Therefore, Sandra got $50.

Answer: 50
