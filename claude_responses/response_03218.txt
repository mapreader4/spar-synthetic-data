Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Jerry won 7 games
* Dave won 3 more games than Jerry, so Dave won 7 + 3 = 10 games
* Ken won 5 more games than Dave, so Ken won 10 + 5 = 15 games

Now, to find the total number of games they played, we add up the number of games won by each player:
* Total games = Jerry's games + Dave's games + Ken's games
* Total games = 7 + 10 + 15 = 32

Answer: 32
