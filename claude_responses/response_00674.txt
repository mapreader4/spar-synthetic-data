Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The parking garage has 4 stories, and there are 100 spots per level.
2. On the first level, there are 58 open parking spots.
3. On the second level, there are 2 more open parking spots than on the first level, so there are 58 + 2 = 60 open parking spots.
4. On the third level, there are 5 more open parking spots than on the second level, so there are 60 + 5 = 65 open parking spots.
5. On the fourth level, there are 31 open parking spots.
6. To find the total number of full parking spots, we need to subtract the number of open parking spots from the total number of spots.
7. The total number of spots is 4 levels x 100 spots per level = 400 spots.
8. The total number of open parking spots is 58 + 60 + 65 + 31 = 214 spots.
9. The number of full parking spots is 400 - 214 = 186 spots.

Answer: 186
