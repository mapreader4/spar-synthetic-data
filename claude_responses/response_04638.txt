Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Sonja's Expenses:
- 1 loaf of French bread: $3
- 1 platter of cold cuts: $23
Total for Sonja: $3 + $23 = $26

Barbara's Expenses:
- Soda for 5 people: $1 x 5 = $5
- 2 boxes of crackers: $2 x 2 = $4
Total for Barbara: $5 + $4 = $9

Mario and Rick's Expenses:
- 2 packages of Cheese Doodles: $3 x 2 = $6
Total for Mario and Rick: $6

Danica's Expenses:
- 1 package of paper plates: $4

Total Expenses for the rest of the office:
$9 + $6 + $4 = $19

Now, to find how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together:
Sonja's Expenses: $26
Rest of the Office's Expenses: $19
Difference: $26 - $19 = $7

Answer: $7
