Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ricky originally had 40 roses.
2) His little sister stole 4 roses, so now he has 40 - 4 = 36 roses left.
3) Ricky wants to give away the remaining 36 roses in equal portions to 9 different people.
4) To find the number of roses each person will get, we divide the total number of roses (36) by the number of people (9).
5) 36 รท 9 = 4
