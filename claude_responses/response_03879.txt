Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bruce can make 15 batches of pizza dough using 1 sack of flour
* He uses 5 sacks of flour per day
* We need to find out how many pizza doughs he can make in a week

First, let's calculate how many pizza doughs he can make in a day:
* 15 batches per sack of flour
* 5 sacks of flour per day
* 15 batches x 5 sacks = 75 pizza doughs per day

Now, to find the number of pizza doughs he can make in a week:
* There are 7 days in a week
* 75 pizza doughs per day x 7 days = 525 pizza doughs per week

Answer: 525
