Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sophie's aunt gave her $260 to spend on clothes.
2) She bought 2 shirts that cost $18.50 each, so that's 2 x $18.50 = $37 spent on the shirts.
3) She also bought a pair of trousers that cost $63.
4) So the total amount she has spent so far is $37 + $63 = $100.
5) She has $260 - $100 = $160 remaining in her budget.
6) She wants to buy 4 more articles of clothing with the remaining $160.
7) To split the cost of each item evenly, we divide the remaining budget ($160) by the number of items she wants to buy (4).
8) $160 / 4 = $40.

Answer: $40
