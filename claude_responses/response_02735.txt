Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

In the first week, Bob worked 44 hours.
* The first 40 hours are considered regular hours, and he gets paid $5 per hour for those.
* The remaining 4 hours are considered overtime hours, and he gets paid $6 per hour for those.

So, for the first week:
* Regular hours: 40 hours x $5 per hour = $200
* Overtime hours: 4 hours x $6 per hour = $24
* Total for the first week: $200 + $24 = $224

In the second week, Bob worked 48 hours.
* The first 40 hours are considered regular hours, and he gets paid $5 per hour for those.
* The remaining 8 hours are considered overtime hours, and he gets paid $6 per hour for those.

So, for the second week:
* Regular hours: 40 hours x $5 per hour = $200
* Overtime hours: 8 hours x $6 per hour = $48
* Total for the second week: $200 + $48 = $248

Now, to calculate the total amount Bob made:
* Total for the first week: $224
* Total for the second week: $248
* Total amount Bob made: $224 + $248 = $472

Answer: $472
