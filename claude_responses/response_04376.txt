Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Austin receives $5 for every hour he helps his father build the deck
* He works for 2 hours on Mondays, 1 hour on Wednesdays, and 3 hours on Fridays
* So, the total number of hours he works per week is:
    - 2 hours on Monday
    - 1 hour on Wednesday
    - 3 hours on Friday
    - Total: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 hours per week
* The bicycle costs $180
* To calculate how many weeks he needs to work, we need to find how much he earns per week and then divide the cost of the bicycle by that amount
* He earns $5 per hour, and he works 6 hours per week
* So, he earns $5 x 6 = $30 per week
* To find how many weeks he needs to work, we divide the cost of the bicycle ($180) by his weekly earnings ($30):
    - $180 / $30 = 6 weeks

Answer: 6 weeks
