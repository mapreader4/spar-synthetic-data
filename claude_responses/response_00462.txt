Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour
* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* So, in 1 minute, Roberto can skip 4,200 / 60 = 70 times
* Valerie can skip 80 times a minute
* They jump rope for 15 minutes
* Roberto's skips in 15 minutes = 70 skips/minute * 15 minutes = 1,050 skips
* Valerie's skips in 15 minutes = 80 skips/minute * 15 minutes = 1,200 skips
* Total skips = Roberto's skips + Valerie's skips = 1,050 + 1,200 = 2,250 skips

Answer: 2,250
