Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Justin and Sabrina have a combined total of 50 pencils
* Justin has 8 more than twice as many pencils as Sabrina
* Let's represent Sabrina's number of pencils as x
* Then, Justin's number of pencils is 2x + 8
* The total number of pencils is 50, so we can write the equation:
x + (2x + 8) = 50
* Solving for x, we get:
3x + 8 = 50
3x = 42
x = 14

Therefore, Sabrina has 14 pencils.

Answer: 14
