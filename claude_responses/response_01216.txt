Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The teacher brings in 14 mini-cupcakes and 12 donut holes, for a total of 14 + 12 = 26 desserts.
2) There are 13 students in the class.
3) To find how many desserts each student gets, we need to divide the total number of desserts (26) by the number of students (13).
4) 26 รท 13 = 2.
