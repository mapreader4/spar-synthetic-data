Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Oliver had 135 stickers initially.
2) He used 1/3 of his stickers. To calculate this, we take 1/3 of 135, which is 135 * 1/3 = 45 stickers used.
3) Now, he has the remaining stickers, which is 135 - 45 = 90 stickers.
4) He then gave 2/5 of the remaining 90 stickers to his friend. To calculate this, we take 2/5 of 90, which is 90 * 2/5 = 36 stickers given to his friend.
5) The remaining stickers that Oliver kept is 90 - 36 = 54 stickers.
