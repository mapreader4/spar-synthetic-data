Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kindergartners:
   * 101 Kindergartners
   * Each shirt cost $5.80
   * Total cost for Kindergartners: 101 * $5.80 = $585.80

2. First Graders:
   * 113 First Graders
   * Each shirt cost $5.00

3. Second Graders:
   * 107 Second Graders
   * Each shirt cost $5.60
   * Total cost for Second Graders: 107 * $5.60 = $599.20

4. Third Graders:
   * 108 Third Graders
   * Each shirt cost $5.25

5. Total cost for all shirts:
   * $585.80 + $565.00 + $599.20 + $567.00 = $2,317.00

Answer: $2,317
