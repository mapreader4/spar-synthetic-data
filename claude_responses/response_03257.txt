Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there are 50 passengers on the bus.
* At the first stop, 16 more passengers get on the bus.
* So, the total number of passengers on the bus after the first stop is 50 + 16 = 66.
* At the other stops, 22 passengers get off the bus and 5 passengers get on the bus.
* So, the total number of passengers who got off is 22, and the total number of passengers who got on is 5.
* Therefore, the net change in the number of passengers is 22 - 5 = 17 passengers getting off the bus.
* The final number of passengers on the bus is the initial 66 passengers, minus the 17 passengers who got off, which is 66 - 17 = 49 passengers.

Answer: 49
