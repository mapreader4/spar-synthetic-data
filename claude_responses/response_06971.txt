Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bag contains 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards.
2) There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards.
3) There are 200 hockey cards in the bag.

To find the total number of cards in the bag, we need to first find the number of football cards and baseball cards.

Step 1: Find the number of football cards.
Since there are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards, and there are 200 hockey cards, we can calculate the number of football cards as:
Number of football cards = 4 x 200 = 800

Step 2: Find the number of baseball cards.
Since there are 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards, we can calculate the number of baseball cards as:
Number of baseball cards = 800 - 50 = 750

Step 3: Find the total number of cards in the bag.
Total number of cards = Number of football cards + Number of baseball cards + Number of hockey cards
Total number of cards = 800 + 750 + 200 = 1750

Answer: 1750
