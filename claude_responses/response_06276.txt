Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Daliah picked up 17.5 pounds of garbage.
2) Dewei picked up 2 pounds less than Daliah, so Dewei picked up 17.5 - 2 = 15.5 pounds of garbage.
3) Zane picked up 4 times as many pounds of garbage as Dewei, so Zane picked up 4 x 15.5 = 62 pounds of garbage.

Answer: 62
