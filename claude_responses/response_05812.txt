Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The store owner repacked his oils into 200 mL bottles
* He was able to make 20 bottles
* To find the total amount of oil, we need to multiply the volume of each bottle (200 mL) by the number of bottles (20)
* 200 mL x 20 bottles = 4,000 mL
* To convert mL to liters, we divide by 1,000 since 1 liter = 1,000 mL
* 4,000 mL / 1,000 = 4 liters

Answer: 4 liters
