Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are five times as many swordfish as pufferfish in the aquarium exhibit
* The total number of fish in the exhibit is 90
* Let's represent the number of pufferfish as x
* Since there are five times as many swordfish as pufferfish, the number of swordfish can be represented as 5x
* The total number of fish is the sum of the swordfish and pufferfish, so we can write the equation:
x + 5x = 90
* Solving for x, we get:
6x = 90
x = 90/6
x = 15

Answer: 15 pufferfish
