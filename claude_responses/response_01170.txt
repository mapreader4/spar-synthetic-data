Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* School starts at 8:00 AM
* It normally takes Andy 30 minutes to get to school
* Today, he had to stop for 3 minutes at 4 red lights
* He also had to wait 10 minutes to get past construction
* He left his house at 7:15 AM

First, let's calculate the total additional time it took him to get to school today:
* 4 red lights x 3 minutes each = 12 minutes
* 10 minutes waiting for construction

So the total additional time was 12 minutes + 10 minutes = 22 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time it took him to get to school today:
* Normal travel time: 30 minutes
* Additional time: 22 minutes
* Total time: 30 minutes + 22 minutes = 52 minutes

He left his house at 7:15 AM, and it took him 52 minutes to get to school. So he arrived at:
* 7:15 AM + 52 minutes = 8:07 AM

School starts at 8:00 AM, so he was 7 minutes late.

Answer: 7 minutes
