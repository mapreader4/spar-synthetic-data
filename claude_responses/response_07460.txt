Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The school is adding 5 rows of seats to the auditorium
* Each row has 8 seats
* So the total number of new seats is 5 rows x 8 seats per row = 40 seats
* Each seat costs $30
* So the total cost of the seats without any discount would be 40 seats x $30 per seat = $1,200
* The parent offered a 10% discount on each group of 10 seats purchased
* Since there are 40 seats, that's 4 groups of 10 seats
* The discount would be 10% of $300 (the cost of each group of 10 seats) = $30 per group
* So the total discount would be 4 groups x $30 per group = $120
* Therefore, the total amount the school will pay for the new seats is $1,200 - $120 = $1,080

Answer: $1,080
