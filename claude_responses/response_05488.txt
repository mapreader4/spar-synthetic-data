Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The population of Delaware is 974,000 people.
2) The study showed that there are 673 cell phones per 1000 people in the state.
3) To find the total number of cell phones, we need to multiply the population by the number of cell phones per 1000 people.
4) 974,000 people x (673 cell phones / 1000 people) = 655,502 cell phones.

Answer: 655,502
