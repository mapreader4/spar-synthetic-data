Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The mother has 5 pizzas to serve 20 children.
2) She can choose to divide each pizza into 6, 8, or 10 slices.
3) We want to find the number of slices per pizza that will result in each child receiving an equal number of slices.
4) If she divides the pizzas into 6 slices each, there will be a total of 5 * 6 = 30 slices.
5) 30 slices divided by 20 children means each child would get 1.5 slices, which is not an integer.
6) If she divides the pizzas into 8 slices each, there will be a total of 5 * 8 = 40 slices.
7) 40 slices divided by 20 children means each child would get 2 slices, which is an integer.
8) If she divides the pizzas into 10 slices each, there will be a total of 5 * 10 = 50 slices.
9) 50 slices divided by 20 children means each child would get 2.5 slices, which is not an integer.

Answer: 8
