Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jennifer will be 30 years old in 10 years
* This means that Jennifer's current age is 30 - 10 = 20 years old
* Jordana, Jennifer's sister, will be three times as old as Jennifer in 10 years
* This means that in 10 years, Jordana will be 3 x 30 = 90 years old
* To find Jordana's current age, we subtract 10 years from 90 years
* Jordana's current age = 90 - 10 = 80 years old

Answer: 80
