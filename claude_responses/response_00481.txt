Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Julia's family consists of her mom, dad, grandma, and three little sisters.
* Tickets for adults cost $12 each.
* Tickets for children cost $10 each.
* The total number of tickets needed is:
  - 3 adult tickets (for mom, dad, and grandma)
  - 3 child tickets (for the three little sisters)
* To calculate the total cost:
  - 3 adult tickets at $12 each = 3 x $12 = $36
  - 3 child tickets at $10 each = 3 x $10 = $30
  - Total cost = $36 + $30 = $66

Answer: $66
