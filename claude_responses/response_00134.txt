Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The regular ticket costs $109
* Children below 12 years old have a $5 discount
* The couple has 2 children, ages 6 and 10 years old
* They gave the cashier $500

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
* 2 adult tickets at $109 each = $218
* 2 child tickets at $109 - $5 = $104 each = $208
* Total cost of tickets = $218 + $208 = $426

Now, let's calculate the change they will receive:
* They gave the cashier $500
* The total cost of the tickets is $426
* The change they will receive is $500 - $426 = $74

Answer: $74
