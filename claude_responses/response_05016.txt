Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Percius has a collection of marbles
* 40% of the marbles are clear
* 20% of the marbles are black
* The remaining marbles are of other colors
* To find the percentage of marbles that are other colors, we can subtract the clear and black percentages from 100%:
* 100% - 40% - 20% = 40%
* So 40% of the marbles are of other colors
* The friend is asking to take 5 marbles
* On average, the number of marbles of other colors the friend will get is 40% of 5 marbles
* 40% of 5 = 0.4 * 5 = 2 marbles
