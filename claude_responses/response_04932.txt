Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Matinee ticket sales:
   * 32 matinee customers at $5 per ticket
   * 32 x $5 = $160

2. Evening ticket sales:
   * 40 evening customers at $7 per ticket
   * 40 x $7 = $280

3. Opening night ticket sales:
   * 58 opening night customers at $10 per ticket
   * 58 x $10 = $580

4. Total ticket sales:
   * $160 + $280 + $580 = $1,020

5. Popcorn sales:
   * Half the customers bought popcorn at $10 per bucket
   * (32 + 40 + 58) / 2 = 65 customers bought popcorn
   * 65 x $10 = $650

6. Total revenue for the theater:
   * Ticket sales + Popcorn sales
   * $1,020 + $650 = $1,670

Answer: $1,670
