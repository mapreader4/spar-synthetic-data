Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The book has 8 chapters total
* Beth has read 2 chapters in 3 hours
* We need to find how many hours it will take her to read the remaining chapters

First, let's calculate the rate at which Beth is reading the chapters:
* 2 chapters in 3 hours = 2/3 chapters per hour

Now, we can calculate how many chapters are remaining:
* 8 chapters total - 2 chapters read = 6 chapters remaining

Finally, we can calculate how many hours it will take her to read the remaining 6 chapters at her current rate:
* 6 chapters remaining / (2/3 chapters per hour) = 9 hours

Answer: 9
