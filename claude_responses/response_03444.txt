Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Josie's mom gave her a $20 bill
* The items she needed to buy were:
  - Carton of milk for $4.00
  - Loaf of bread for $3.50
  - Box of laundry detergent for $10.25
  - 2 pounds of bananas at $0.75 per pound
* Josie had a coupon for $1.25 off the laundry detergent
* The milk was 1/2 off at checkout

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discounts:
* Milk: $4.00
* Bread: $3.50
* Laundry detergent: $10.25
* Bananas: 2 pounds x $0.75 per pound = $1.50
* Total: $4.00 + $3.50 + $10.25 + $1.50 = $19.25

Now, let's apply the discounts:
* Laundry detergent: $10.25 - $1.25 (coupon) = $9.00
* Milk: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00

The new total is:
* $2.00 + $3.50 + $9.00 + $1.50 = $16.00

Josie's mom gave her a $20 bill, so the amount of money Josie had left over is:
* $20.00 - $16.00 = $4.00
