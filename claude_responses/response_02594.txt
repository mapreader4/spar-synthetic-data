Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John plays paintball 3 times a month
* Each time he plays, he buys 3 boxes of paintballs
* The cost of each box of paintballs is $25

To calculate the total amount he spends a month, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of boxes of paintballs he buys per month:
   * 3 times a month x 3 boxes per time = 9 boxes per month
2. Calculate the total cost of the paintballs per month:
   * 9 boxes per month x $25 per box = $225 per month

Answer: 225
