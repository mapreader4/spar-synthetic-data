Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James needs 40 fish to make one sushi roll
* He bought 400 fish from the market
* 20% of the 400 fish have gone bad and cannot be used
* To find the number of fish that have gone bad, we take 20% of 400:
  * 20% of 400 = 0.20 * 400 = 80 fish have gone bad
* Now, we find the number of fish that are still good:
  * Total fish bought = 400
  * Fish gone bad = 80
  * Fish remaining = 400 - 80 = 320 fish
* To find the number of sushi rolls James can make, we divide the remaining fish by the number of fish needed per roll:
  * 320 fish / 40 fish per roll = 8 sushi rolls

Answer: 8
