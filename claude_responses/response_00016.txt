Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The profit is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively.
2) This means that Mike's share is 2/7 of the total profit, and Johnson's share is 5/7 of the total profit.
3) We know that Johnson got $2500, which is 5/7 of the total profit.
4) To find the total profit, we can set up the equation: 5/7 * Total Profit = $2500
5) Solving for the Total Profit, we get: Total Profit = $2500 * 7/5 = $3500
6) Now we can find Mike's share, which is 2/7 of the total profit: 2/7 * $3500 = $1000
7) Mike spent $200 on a shirt, so his final amount is $1000 - $200 = $800

Answer: $800
