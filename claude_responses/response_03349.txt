Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sara's house is 100 square feet larger than 2 times Nada's house
* So we can represent this as: Sara's house = 2 * Nada's house + 100
* We are told that Sara's house is 1000 square feet
* So we can substitute this in: 1000 = 2 * Nada's house + 100
* Subtracting 100 from both sides: 900 = 2 * Nada's house
* Dividing both sides by 2: 450 = Nada's house

Answer: 450
