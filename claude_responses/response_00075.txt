Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Dale had:
   - 2 slices of toast at £1 each = 2 x £1 = £2
   - 2 eggs at £3 each = 2 x £3 = £6
   - Total for Dale = £2 + £6 = £8

2. Andrew had:
   - 1 slice of toast at £1 each = 1 x £1 = £1
   - 2 eggs at £3 each = 2 x £3 = £6
   - Total for Andrew = £1 + £6 = £7

3. To find the total cost of their breakfast, we add the totals for Dale and Andrew:
   - Total cost = £8 + £7 = £15

Answer: £15
