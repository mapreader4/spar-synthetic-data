Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Caleb bought 10 cartons of ice cream, and each carton costs $4.
2) So the total cost of the ice cream is 10 cartons x $4 per carton = $40.
3) Caleb also bought 4 cartons of frozen yoghurt, and each carton costs $1.
4) So the total cost of the frozen yoghurt is 4 cartons x $1 per carton = $4.
5) To find the difference between what Caleb spent on ice cream and what he spent on frozen yoghurt, we subtract the cost of the frozen yoghurt from the cost of the ice cream:
$40 (ice cream) - $4 (frozen yoghurt) = $36.
