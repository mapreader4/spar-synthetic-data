Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The garden is a rectangular plot 225 feet long by 125 feet wide.
* Bob wants to have a 3-foot wide gate and a 10-foot wide gate.
* To calculate the total fencing needed, we need to find the perimeter of the garden, and then subtract the width of the two gates.

The perimeter of the garden is:
* 2 x (225 feet + 125 feet) = 2 x 350 feet = 700 feet

The width of the two gates is:
* 3 feet + 10 feet = 13 feet

Therefore, the total fencing needed is:
* 700 feet - 13 feet = 687 feet

Answer: 687
