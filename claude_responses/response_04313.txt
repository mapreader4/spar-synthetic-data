Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob won the 100 dollar grand prize for the first 2 weeks
* So, he has earned 2 * $100 = $200 so far
* The puppy he wants to buy costs $1000
* To find the minimum number of additional weeks Bob must win first place, we need to find how many more weeks he needs to earn to reach the $1000 goal
* To do this, we subtract the amount he has already earned ($200) from the total cost of the puppy ($1000)
* $1000 - $200 = $800
* Since Bob wins $100 each week he wins first place, he needs to win first place an additional 8 times to earn the remaining $800
* Therefore, the minimum number of additional weeks Bob must win first place is 8.

Answer: 8
