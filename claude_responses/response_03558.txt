Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rocky boxed 190 fights in his career
* 50% of his fights were knockouts
* To calculate the number of knockouts:
  * 50% of 190 fights = 0.5 * 190 = 95 knockouts
* 20% of the knockouts were in the first round
* To calculate the number of first-round knockouts:
  * 20% of 95 knockouts = 0.2 * 95 = 19 first-round knockouts

Answer: 19
