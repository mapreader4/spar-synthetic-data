Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The circle has a radius of 14 feet.
2) The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diameter is 28 feet.
3) We want to find how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle.
4) To do this, we need to convert the diameter from feet to inches.
5) 28 feet x 12 inches/foot = 336 inches.
6) Each pencil is 6 inches long.
7) 336 inches / 6 inches per pencil = 56 pencils.

Answer: 56
