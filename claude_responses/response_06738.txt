Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Beth's primary tank has enough oxygen for 2 hours underwater
* She also has several 1-hour supplemental tanks
* She needs to be underwater for 8 hours total

To calculate the number of supplemental tanks she will need, we first need to determine how much time she can spend underwater using her primary tank.

* Primary tank: 2 hours
* Time remaining: 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours

Since each supplemental tank lasts for 1 hour, she will need 6 supplemental tanks to cover the remaining 6 hours.

Answer: 6
