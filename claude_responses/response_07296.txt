Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maddy is in college for 8 semesters
* She needs 120 credits to graduate
* Each class is 3 credits

To find the number of classes she needs to take per semester, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of credits she needs to take
2. Divide the total credits by the number of credits per class to get the total number of classes
3. Divide the total number of classes by the number of semesters to get the number of classes per semester

Step 1: Calculate the total number of credits
* Total credits needed = 120

Step 2: Calculate the total number of classes
* Total classes = Total credits / Credits per class
* Total classes = 120 / 3 = 40

Step 3: Calculate the number of classes per semester
* Classes per semester = Total classes / Number of semesters
* Classes per semester = 40 / 8 = 5
