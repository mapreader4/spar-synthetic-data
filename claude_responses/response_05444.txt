Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, it rained 3 inches more than Sunday
* Since it rained 4 inches on Sunday, it rained 4 + 3 = 7 inches on Monday
* On Tuesday, it rained twice as much as Monday
* Since it rained 7 inches on Monday, it rained 7 x 2 = 14 inches on Tuesday
* To find the total rainfall over the 3 days, we add the rainfall from each day:
* Sunday: 4 inches
* Monday: 7 inches
* Tuesday: 14 inches
* Total rainfall = 4 + 7 + 14 = 25 inches

Answer: 25
