Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's old stereo system cost $250.
2. He got 80% of the value for the old system, which means he received 80% of $250, or $200.
3. He then bought a new system that costs $600.
4. He got a 25% discount on the new system, which means he paid 75% of $600, or $450.
5. To calculate the total amount of money that came out of his pocket, we need to add the amount he received for the old system ($200) to the amount he paid for the new system ($450).
6. $200 + $450 = $650.

Answer: $650.
