Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

In the first round:
* Sam completed 16 skips
* Jeff completed 1 fewer skip than Sam, so Jeff completed 15 skips

In the second round:
* Sam completed 16 skips
* Jeff completed 3 fewer skips than Sam, so Jeff completed 13 skips

In the third round:
* Sam completed 16 skips
* Jeff completed 4 more skips than Sam, so Jeff completed 20 skips

In the fourth round:
* Sam completed 16 skips
* Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam, so Jeff completed 8 skips

Now, to calculate the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff:
* Total skips completed by Jeff = 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56
* Number of rounds = 4
* Average skips per round = 56 / 4 = 14
