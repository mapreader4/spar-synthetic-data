Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) You purchased 5 blue apples.
2) Your neighbor gave you twice as many yellow apples as you have blue ones. So, you have 5 x 2 = 10 yellow apples.
3) The total number of apples you have is the sum of the blue and yellow apples: 5 blue + 10 yellow = 15 apples.
4) You then gave your son 1/5 of the total number of apples. 1/5 of 15 is 3 apples.
5) The number of apples you have now is the total number of apples (15) minus the number of apples you gave to your son (3).

Answer: 12 apples.
