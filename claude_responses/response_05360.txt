Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each hamburger is 4 ounces
* Last year's winner ate 84 ounces
* To beat last year's winner, Tonya needs to eat more than 84 ounces

To find the number of hamburgers Tonya needs to eat, we divide the target amount (84 ounces) by the weight of each hamburger (4 ounces):
* 84 ounces / 4 ounces per hamburger = 21 hamburgers

Therefore, Tonya needs to eat 22 or more hamburgers to beat last year's winner.

Answer: 22
