Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ivar currently has 3 horses
* Each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day
* So each horse consumes 7 liters of water per day (5 liters for drinking + 2 liters for bathing)
* With 3 horses, the total water consumption per day is 3 * 7 = 21 liters
* Ivar added 5 more horses, so now he has 8 horses in total
* Each of the 8 horses consumes 7 liters of water per day
* So the total water consumption per day for all 8 horses is 8 * 7 = 56 liters
* Ivar needs to provide water for the horses for 28 days
* So the total water needed for 28 days is 56 liters per day * 28 days = 1,568 liters

Answer: 1,568
