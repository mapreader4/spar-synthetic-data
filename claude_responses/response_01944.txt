Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) 85 cans were collected in total.
2) LaDonna picked up 25 cans.
3) Prikya picked up twice as many cans as LaDonna, which means Prikya picked up 2 x 25 = 50 cans.
4) Yoki picked up the rest of the cans, which means Yoki picked up the total cans (85) minus the cans picked up by LaDonna (25) and Prikya (50).
5) Therefore, Yoki picked up 85 - 25 - 50 = 10 cans.

Answer: 10
