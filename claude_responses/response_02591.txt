Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jake can eat 3 papayas per week
* His brother can eat 5 papayas per week
* His father can eat 4 papayas per week
* We need to account for 4 weeks

To calculate the total number of papayas needed for 4 weeks:
* Jake's papayas per week: 3 
* Jake's papayas for 4 weeks: 3 x 4 = 12
* Brother's papayas per week: 5
* Brother's papayas for 4 weeks: 5 x 4 = 20
* Father's papayas per week: 4
* Father's papayas for 4 weeks: 4 x 4 = 16

Now we add up the total papayas needed for all 3 of them over the 4 weeks:
* Total papayas needed = 12 + 20 + 16 = 48

Answer: 48
