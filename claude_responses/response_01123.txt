Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* David found $12 on the street
* He gave the $12 to his friend Evan
* Evan had $1 before receiving the $12 from David
* Evan needs to buy a watch worth $20

To calculate how much Evan still needs, we need to add up the money Evan has and then subtract it from the cost of the watch.

Evan has:
* $1 (original amount)
* + $12 (received from David)
* = $13 total

The watch costs $20.
So, the amount Evan still needs is:
* $20 (cost of watch)
* - $13 (total amount Evan has)
* = $7
