Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Greg drives 30 miles from his workplace to the farmer's market.
2) After buying his groceries, he drives home.
3) To get home, he travels for 30 minutes at 20 miles per hour.
4) To calculate the distance he travels to get home, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time
5) Distance = 20 miles per hour x 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 10 miles
6) Therefore, the total distance Greg travels is:
30 miles (from workplace to farmer's market) + 10 miles (from farmer's market to home) = 40 miles

Answer: 40
