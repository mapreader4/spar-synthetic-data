Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 2 tablespoons of popcorn kernels makes 4 cups of popcorn
* Joanie wants 3 cups of popcorn
* Mitchell wants 4 cups of popcorn
* Miles and Davis will split 6 cups of popcorn, so 3 cups each
* Cliff wants 3 cups of popcorn
* To calculate the total cups of popcorn needed:
  - Joanie: 3 cups
  - Mitchell: 4 cups
  - Miles and Davis: 3 cups each, so 6 cups total
  - Cliff: 3 cups
* Total cups of popcorn needed = 3 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 16 cups
* Since 2 tablespoons of kernels makes 4 cups of popcorn, we can use the following ratio:
  - 2 tablespoons : 4 cups = x tablespoons : 16 cups
* Solving for x, we get:
  - x = (16 cups * 2 tablespoons) / 4 cups = 8 tablespoons

Answer: 8 tablespoons
