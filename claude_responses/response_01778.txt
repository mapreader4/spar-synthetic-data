Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dorothy spent $53 to buy the doughnut ingredients.
2) She made 25 doughnuts.
3) She sells each doughnut for $3.
4) To calculate her profit, we need to find the total revenue from selling the doughnuts, and then subtract the cost of the ingredients.
5) Total revenue = 25 doughnuts x $3 per doughnut = $75.
6) Profit = Total revenue - Cost of ingredients = $75 - $53 = $22.
