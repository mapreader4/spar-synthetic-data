Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John travels 15 miles on his bike ride.
2) Jill travels 5 miles less than John, so Jill travels 15 - 5 = 10 miles.
3) Jim travels only 20% as far as Jill, so we need to calculate 20% of Jill's distance.
4) 20% of 10 miles is 0.2 * 10 = 2 miles.

Answer: 2 miles
