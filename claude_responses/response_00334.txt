Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For the strawberry ice cream:
* Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream
* To make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream, she needs 4 cups of strawberries
* The 2 cup packages of strawberries cost $3.00 each
* So, she needs to buy 2 packages of strawberries at $3.00 each, which is 2 x $3.00 = $6.00
* She also needs 2 cups of heavy cream, which comes in a 4 cup container for $4.00
* So the total cost for the strawberry ice cream is $6.00 + $4.00 = $10.00

For the raspberry ice cream:
* Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream
* To make 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, she needs 4 cups of raspberries
* The 2 cup packages of raspberries cost $5.00 each
* So, she needs to buy 2 packages of raspberries at $5.00 each, which is 2 x $5.00 = $10.00
* She also needs 2 cups of heavy cream, which comes in a 4 cup container for $4.00
* So the total cost for the raspberry ice cream is $10.00 + $4.00 = $14.00

To make 1 quart of each ice cream, the total cost is:
$10.00 + $14.00 = $24.00

Answer: $24
