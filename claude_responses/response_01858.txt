Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first house was not too far from their work and the price was accessible
* The second house was really big and Jill loved it, but it was twice as expensive as the first one and was way over their budget
* They ended up buying the first house
* The price of both houses altogether is $600,000

We can use this information to calculate the price of the first house.

Let's say the price of the first house is x.
The price of the second house is 2x, since it was twice as expensive as the first one.

The total price of both houses is $600,000, so:
x + 2x = $600,000
3x = $600,000
x = $200,000

Therefore, Jill and Bob ended up paying $200,000 for their new house.

Answer: $200,000
