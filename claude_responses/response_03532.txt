Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Donna makes 20 sandwiches.
2) She then cuts each sandwich in half, so now she has 40 halves.
3) She then cuts each of those 40 halves in half again, so now she has 80 quarters.
4) She then gives everyone 8 portions each.
5) To find how many people she can feed, we need to divide the total number of portions (80) by the number of portions per person (8).
6) 80 รท 8 = 10

Answer: 10
