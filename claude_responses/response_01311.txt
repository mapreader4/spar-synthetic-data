Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The original price of the TV is $1700, excluding tax.
2) The value-added tax (VAT) is 15% of the original price.
3) To calculate the VAT, we take 15% of $1700:
15% of $1700 = 0.15 x $1700 = $255
4) To find the final price of the TV including the VAT, we add the VAT to the original price:
$1700 + $255 = $1955
Answer: $1955
