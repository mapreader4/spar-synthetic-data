To solve this problem, we need to find the number of 5-second intervals in one hour.

Given information:
- The device records the temperature every 5 seconds.
- The device records data for one hour.

Step 1: Convert one hour to seconds.
1 hour = 60 minutes = 60 Ã— 60 = 3600 seconds

Step 2: Find the number of 5-second intervals in 3600 seconds.
Number of 5-second intervals = 3600 seconds / 5 seconds per interval
Number of 5-second intervals = 3600 / 5 = 720 intervals

Therefore, the device will record 720 instances of data.

Answer: 720
