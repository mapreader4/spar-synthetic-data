Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bianca worked for 12.5 hours last weekend.
2) Celeste worked for twice the amount of time that Bianca worked, which is 2 * 12.5 = 25 hours.
3) McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste, which is 25 - 8.5 = 16.5 hours.
4) To find the total number of minutes worked by the 3 people, we need to add up the hours worked by each person and convert the total to minutes.
5) Bianca worked 12.5 hours, Celeste worked 25 hours, and McClain worked 16.5 hours.
6) The total number of hours worked is 12.5 + 25 + 16.5 = 54 hours.
7) To convert 54 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes per hour: 54 * 60 = 3,240 minutes.

Answer: 3,240 minutes.
