Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martha received 40 turtles.
2) Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha.
3) To find how many turtles Marion received, we add 20 to the number of turtles Martha received:
   * Marion's turtles = Martha's turtles + 20
   * Marion's turtles = 40 + 20 = 60 turtles
4) To find the total number of turtles they received together, we add Martha's turtles and Marion's turtles:
   * Total turtles = Martha's turtles + Marion's turtles
   * Total turtles = 40 + 60 = 100 turtles

Answer: 100
