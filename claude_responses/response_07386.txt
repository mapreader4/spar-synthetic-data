Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 80 total passengers on the airplane
* The number of men and women is equal
* There are 30 men
* Therefore, the number of women must also be 30, since the number of men and women is equal
* The remaining passengers are children
* To find the number of children, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total number of passengers
* Total passengers = 80
* Number of men = 30
* Number of women = 30
* Number of children = 80 - 30 - 30 = 20

Answer: 20
