Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hilary gets 4 ears of corn per stalk, and she has 108 stalks growing.
2) So the total number of ears of corn is 4 x 108 = 432 ears of corn.
3) Half of the ears of corn have 500 kernels, and the other half have 100 more, which is 600 kernels.
4) So the number of ears with 500 kernels is 432 / 2 = 216.
5) The number of ears with 600 kernels is also 216.
6) The total number of kernels is:
   - 216 ears x 500 kernels = 108,000 kernels
   - 216 ears x 600 kernels = 129,600 kernels
7) Adding these together, the total number of kernels of corn Hilary has to shuck is:
   108,000 + 129,600 = 237,600 kernels.

Answer: 237,600
