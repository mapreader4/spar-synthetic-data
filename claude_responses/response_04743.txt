Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Mike changes all the tires on 12 motorcycles.
2) Each motorcycle has 2 tires.
3) So for the 12 motorcycles, he changed 12 * 2 = 24 tires.
4) Mike also changes all the tires on 10 cars.
5) Each car has 4 tires.
6) So for the 10 cars, he changed 10 * 4 = 40 tires.
7) To get the total number of tires changed, we add the tires changed for the motorcycles and the cars:
24 + 40 = 64.

Answer: 64
