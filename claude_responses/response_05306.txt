Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 45 children at the Johnson family reunion.
2) The number of adults was one third as many as the number of children. To calculate the number of adults, we divide the number of children (45) by 3:
45 / 3 = 15 adults
3) One third of the adults wore blue. To calculate the number of adults who wore blue, we take the total number of adults (15) and divide it by 3:
15 / 3 = 5 adults wore blue
4) To find the number of adults who did not wear blue, we subtract the number of adults who wore blue (5) from the total number of adults (15):
15 - 5 = 10 adults did not wear blue
