Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Parker originally had 18 stamps in his scrapbook.
2) Addie has 72 stamps.
3) Addie put one fourth of her 72 stamps in Parker's scrapbook.
4) To calculate one fourth of 72, we divide 72 by 4: 72 / 4 = 18.
5) So Addie added 18 stamps to Parker's scrapbook.
6) The original 18 stamps plus the 18 stamps Addie added equals 36 stamps.

Answer: 36
