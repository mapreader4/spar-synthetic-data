Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ethan makes beeswax candles
* For each candle, he uses 8 ounces of beeswax and 1 ounce of coconut oil
* He makes three less than 10 candles
* To find the combined weight of the candles, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of candles he made
2. Multiply the number of candles by the total weight of each candle (8 ounces of beeswax + 1 ounce of coconut oil = 9 ounces per candle)

Step 1: Calculate the number of candles he made
* He makes three less than 10 candles
* 10 - 3 = 7 candles

Step 2: Multiply the number of candles by the total weight of each candle
* 7 candles x 9 ounces per candle = 63 ounces

Answer: 63 ounces
