Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jorge bought 24 tickets.
2) Each ticket costs $7.
3) He is given a 50% discount for purchasing so many tickets.
4) To calculate the total cost before the discount:
   * 24 tickets x $7 per ticket = $168
5) To calculate the discount amount:
   * 50% of $168 = 0.5 x $168 = $84
6) To calculate the total cost after the discount:
   * $168 - $84 = $84
Answer: $84
