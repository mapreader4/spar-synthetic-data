Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexis has 4 times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined
* Alexis has 60 mangoes
* To find the total number of mangoes that Dilan and Ashley have combined, we can divide Alexis' 60 mangoes by 4:
* 60 mangoes / 4 = 15 mangoes
* So Dilan and Ashley have a combined total of 15 mangoes
* To find the total number of mangoes that all of them have combined, we add Alexis' 60 mangoes to Dilan and Ashley's 15 mangoes:
* 60 mangoes + 15 mangoes = 75 mangoes

Answer: 75
