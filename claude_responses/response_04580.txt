Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah played 100 games in total
* She tied 40 of those games
* She lost $30 overall
* For each game she wins, she earns $1
* For each game she ties, she earns $0
* For each game she loses, she loses $2

First, let's calculate how much she lost from the games she lost:
* If she lost $30 in total, and she loses $2 per game she loses, then the number of games she lost must be:
* $30 / $2 per loss = 15 games lost

Now, we can calculate the number of games she won:
* Total games played = 100
* Games tied = 40
* Games lost = 15
* Games won = Total games - Games tied - Games lost
* Games won = 100 - 40 - 15 = 45 games won

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 45
