Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bus takes 40 minutes to drive 80 miles to the beach
* Amanda's car takes 5 fewer minutes to complete the same trip
* So, the car takes 40 - 5 = 35 minutes to drive 80 miles to the beach
* To calculate the time for a round trip, we need to double the time it takes to drive to the beach
* So, the time for a round trip is 2 * 35 = 70 minutes

Answer: 70 minutes
