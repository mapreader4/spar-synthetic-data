Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Table B had twice as much money on it as table C
* Table C had $20 more than table A
* Table A had $40 on it

First, let's find out how much money was on table C:
* Table C had $20 more than table A
* Table A had $40
* Therefore, table C had $40 + $20 = $60

Now, let's find out how much money was on table B:
* Table B had twice as much money on it as table C
* Table C had $60
* Therefore, table B had $60 x 2 = $120

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money on all the tables:
* Table A had $40
* Table B had $120
* Table C had $60
* Total = $40 + $120 + $60 = $220

Answer: $220
