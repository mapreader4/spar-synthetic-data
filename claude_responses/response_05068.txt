Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emma bought a loaf of bread with an unknown number of slices
* Andy ate 3 slices at two different points in time, so he ate a total of 6 slices
* Emma decided to make toast with the remaining slices
* She uses 2 slices of bread to make 1 piece of toast
* She was able to make 10 pieces of toast
* She had 1 slice of bread left

To find the total number of slices in the original loaf, we need to add up the number of slices used for toast and the number of slices eaten by Andy.

For the toast:
* 10 pieces of toast x 2 slices per piece = 20 slices used for toast

For Andy:
* 6 slices eaten by Andy

Total slices used:
* 20 slices for toast + 6 slices eaten by Andy = 26 slices

We also know that there was 1 slice of bread left, so the total number of slices in the original loaf must have been:
* 26 slices used + 1 slice left = 27 slices

Answer: 27
