Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yesterday, Joan had half as many gemstones as minerals in her rock collection.
* Today, she found 6 more mineral samples.
* Now, she has a total of 48 mineral samples.

Let's start by finding out how many mineral samples she had yesterday:
* Today, she has 48 mineral samples.
* She found 6 more mineral samples today.
* So, yesterday she had 48 - 6 = 42 mineral samples.

Now, we know that yesterday she had half as many gemstones as minerals. So, the number of gemstones yesterday was:
* 42 / 2 = 21 gemstones

Therefore, the number of gemstone samples she has now is 21.

Answer: 21
