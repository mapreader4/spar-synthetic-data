Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jenna pays $3 for each widget and resells it for $8. So, the profit per widget is $8 - $3 = $5.

2. Jenna sells 5000 widgets in a month. Her total revenue is 5000 * $8 = $40,000.

3. Her total cost of goods sold is 5000 * $3 = $15,000.

4. Her gross profit is $40,000 - $15,000 = $25,000.

5. She has to pay $10,000 in rent and $2,500 each to 4 workers, which is a total of $10,000 + $10,000 = $20,000 in fixed costs.

6. Her net profit before taxes is $25,000 - $20,000 = $5,000.

7. She has to pay 20% of her total profit in taxes, which is 0.2 * $5,000 = $1,000.

8. Her total profit after taxes is $5,000 - $1,000 = $4,000.

Answer: $4,000
