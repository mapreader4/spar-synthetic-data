Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Jack makes cold brew coffee in batches of 1.5 gallons
* He drinks 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days
* It takes 20 hours to make each batch of coffee

First, let's calculate how many batches of coffee he needs to make over 24 days:
* He drinks 96 ounces every 2 days
* In 24 days, he will drink 96 * (24/2) = 1,152 ounces of coffee
* Each batch makes 1.5 gallons, which is 1.5 * 128 = 192 ounces
* So, he needs to make 1,152 / 192 = 6 batches of coffee over 24 days

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends making coffee over 24 days:
* Each batch takes 20 hours to make
* He needs to make 6 batches
* So, the total time he spends making coffee over 24 days is 6 * 20 = 120 hours

Answer: 120 hours
