Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ian worked 8 hours doing online surveys.
2) On average, he earns $18 per hour doing surveys.
3) To calculate the total amount he earned, we multiply the number of hours worked (8) by the average hourly rate ($18):
8 hours x $18 per hour = $144 total earned
4) Ian spent half the money he made on doing the surveys.
5) To calculate how much he spent, we take the total amount earned ($144) and divide it by 2:
$144 / 2 = $72 spent
6) To calculate how much money he has left, we take the total amount earned ($144) and subtract the amount spent ($72):
$144 - $72 = $72 left

Answer: $72
