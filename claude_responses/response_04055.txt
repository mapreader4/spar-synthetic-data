Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 clowns and 30 children attending the carousel
* The total number of people attending is 4 + 30 = 34
* The candy seller had 700 candies to start with
* The candy seller sold 20 candies to each of the 34 people attending
* To calculate the total number of candies sold, we multiply 20 by 34: 20 x 34 = 680
* To calculate the number of candies left, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies: 700 - 680 = 20

Answer: 20
