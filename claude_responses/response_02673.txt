Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first month, Alice saved $10.
* In the second month, she saved $10 + $30 = $40.
* In the third month, she saved $10 + $30 + $30 = $70.
* To find the total amount she saved by the end of the third month, we add up the amounts from each month:
* $10 + $40 + $70 = $120.

Answer: 120
