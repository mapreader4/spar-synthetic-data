Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Méliès bought 2 kg of meat.
2) The meat costs $82 per kilogram.
3) To calculate the total cost of the meat, we multiply the quantity (2 kg) by the price per kilogram ($82):
   2 kg x $82 per kg = $164
4) Méliès has $180 in his wallet.
5) To calculate the amount of money Méliès has left after paying for the meat, we subtract the total cost of the meat ($164) from the amount of money he had ($180):
   $180 - $164 = $16

Answer: 16
