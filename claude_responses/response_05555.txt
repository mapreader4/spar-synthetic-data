Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tilly counts 120 stars to the east of her house
* She counts six times that number to the west
* To find the total number of stars, we need to add the number of stars to the east and the number of stars to the west

First, let's find the number of stars to the west:
* 6 times 120 stars = 6 * 120 = 720 stars to the west

Now, let's add the number of stars to the east and the number of stars to the west:
* 120 stars to the east + 720 stars to the west = 120 + 720 = 840 stars total

Answer: 840
