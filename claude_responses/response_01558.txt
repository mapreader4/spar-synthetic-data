1. Janet's current job:
   - Hourly rate: $30/hour
   - Hours per week: 40 hours
   - Earnings per week: $30 x 40 = $1,200
   - Earnings per month (4 weeks): $1,200 x 4 = $4,800

2. Freelancing:
   - Hourly rate: $40/hour
   - Hours per week: 40 hours
   - Earnings per week: $40 x 40 = $1,600

3. Additional costs as a freelancer:
   - FICA taxes: $25 per week
   - Healthcare premiums: $400 per month
   - Total additional costs per month: $25 x 4 + $400 = $500

4. Net earnings as a freelancer per month:
   - Earnings per month: $6,400
   - Additional costs per month: $500
   - Net earnings per month: $6,400 - $500 = $5,900

5. Difference in earnings per month:
   - Freelancing net earnings per month: $5,900
   - Current job earnings per month: $4,800
   - Difference in earnings per month: $5,900 - $4,800 = $1,100
