Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Josiah puts a quarter (which is $0.25) in his piggy bank every day for 24 days.
   * Total amount saved by Josiah = $0.25 x 24 days = $6.00

2. Leah saves 50 cents (which is $0.50) in an empty pickle jar every day for 20 days.
   * Total amount saved by Leah = $0.50 x 20 days = $10.00

3. Megan saves twice as much as Leah for 12 days.
   * Megan's daily savings = $0.50 x 2 = $1.00
   * Total amount saved by Megan = $1.00 x 12 days = $12.00

4. Now, we add up the total amounts saved by the three children:
   * Total amount saved = Josiah's savings + Leah's savings + Megan's savings
   * Total amount saved = $6.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 = $28.00

Answer: $28.00
