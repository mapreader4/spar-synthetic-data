Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rosie runs 6 miles per hour
* On Monday, she ran for 1 hour, so she ran 6 miles
* On Tuesday, she ran for 30 minutes, so she ran 3 miles
* On Wednesday, she ran for 1 hour, so she ran 6 miles
* On Thursday, she ran for 20 minutes, so she ran 2 miles
* In total, she has run 6 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 17 miles
* She wants to run 20 miles for the week
* So, she needs to run 20 - 17 = 3 more miles
* Since she runs 6 miles per hour, to run 3 more miles, she needs to run for 3 / 6 = 0.5 hours
* 0.5 hours is equal to 30 minutes

Answer: 30 minutes
