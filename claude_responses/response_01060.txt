Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barbie bought 12 pairs of earrings
* She gave half of them to Alissa
* Alissa's total number of earrings is triple the number of earrings she was given

First, let's calculate how many earrings Barbie gave to Alissa:
* Barbie bought 12 pairs of earrings
* She gave half of them to Alissa
* So, Alissa received 12 / 2 = 6 pairs of earrings

Now, we know that Alissa's total number of earrings is triple the number of earrings she was given:
* Alissa received 6 pairs of earrings
* Her total number of earrings is triple that, so 6 x 3 = 18 earrings

Answer: 18 earrings
