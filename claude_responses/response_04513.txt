Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bronson buys apples from farmers at $12 per bushel
* Each bushel contains 48 apples
* So the cost per apple is $12 / 48 = $0.25 per apple
* Bronson sells the apples to the stores at $0.40 per apple
* He sold 100 apples
* The total revenue from selling 100 apples is 100 * $0.40 = $40
* The total cost of buying 100 apples is 100 * $0.25 = $25
* The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost
* Profit = Revenue - Cost
* Profit = $40 - $25 = $15

Answer: $15
