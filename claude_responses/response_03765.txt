Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wendy polished 50 small glasses
* She polished 10 more large glasses than small glasses
* To find the number of large glasses, we add 10 to the number of small glasses:
    - Number of large glasses = 50 + 10 = 60
* To find the total number of glasses polished, we add the small and large glasses:
    - Total glasses polished = 50 + 60 = 110

Answer: 110
