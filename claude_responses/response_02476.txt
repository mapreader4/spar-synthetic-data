Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Super Clean Car Wash Company cleans 80 cars per day.
2) They make $5 per car washed.
3) We need to find out how much money they will make in 5 days.
4) To do this, we need to multiply the number of cars washed per day (80) by the amount made per car ($5), and then multiply that by the number of days (5).
5) 80 cars per day x $5 per car = $400 per day
6) $400 per day x 5 days = $2,000

Answer: $2,000
