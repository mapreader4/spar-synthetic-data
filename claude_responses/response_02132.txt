Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The basketball team sold 50 cupcakes for $2 each, so the total revenue from cupcake sales is 50 * $2 = $100.
2) The basketball team sold 40 cookies for $0.5 each, so the total revenue from cookie sales is 40 * $0.5 = $20.
3) The total revenue from all sales is $100 + $20 = $120.
4) The team used this $120 to buy two basketballs that cost $40 each, so the total cost of the basketballs is 2 * $40 = $80.
5) The remaining money after buying the basketballs is $120 - $80 = $40.
6) This $40 was used to buy 20 bottles of energy drinks.
7) To find the cost of each energy drink, we divide the remaining money ($40) by the number of energy drinks (20).
Answer: $2
