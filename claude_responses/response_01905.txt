Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Edward needs 40 feet of copper pipe to complete the job
* For every 5 feet of pipe, he needs 1 tightening bolt
* For each tightening bolt, he needs 2 washers
* He buys a bag of 20 washers for the job

First, let's calculate how many tightening bolts he needs:
* 40 feet of pipe / 5 feet per bolt = 8 bolts

Now, let's calculate how many washers he needs:
* 8 bolts x 2 washers per bolt = 16 washers

Finally, we can calculate the number of washers remaining in the bag:
* 20 washers in the bag - 16 washers used = 4 washers remaining
