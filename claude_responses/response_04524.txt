Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Johann had 60 oranges initially.
2) He then ate 10 oranges, so he had 60 - 10 = 50 oranges left.
3) Half of the 50 oranges were then stolen by Carson, which means 25 oranges were stolen.
4) Carson then returned 5 oranges.

So, the number of oranges Johann has now is:
50 oranges - 25 oranges stolen + 5 oranges returned = 30 oranges.

Answer: 30
