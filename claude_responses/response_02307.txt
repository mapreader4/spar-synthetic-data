Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The sandbox is a square, so the length and width are both 3 ft.
2) The area of the sandbox is the length times the width, which is 3 ft x 3 ft = 9 sq ft.
3) Josh can buy sand in 3 sq ft bags for $4.00 per bag.
4) To calculate the number of bags needed, we divide the total area of the sandbox (9 sq ft) by the area covered by each bag (3 sq ft):
9 sq ft / 3 sq ft per bag = 3 bags
5) The total cost to fill the sandbox is 3 bags x $4.00 per bag = $12.00.

Answer: $12.00
