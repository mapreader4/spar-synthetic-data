Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Each emu has 1 head and 2 legs
* The total number of heads is 60
* The total number of legs is also 60
* Since each emu has 1 head and 2 legs, we can set up an equation:
* Let x = the number of emus in the flock
* Then the total number of heads is x, and the total number of legs is 2x
* We know the total number of heads is 60, so x = 60
* We also know the total number of legs is 60, so 2x = 60
* Solving for x, we get x = 30
* Therefore, there are 30 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.

Answer: 30
