Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first hour, the machine takes 6 minutes to produce each pot.
* In 1 hour, there are 60 minutes.
* So in the first hour, the machine can produce 60 minutes / 6 minutes per pot = 10 pots.
* In the last hour, the machine takes 5 minutes to produce each pot.
* In 1 hour, there are 60 minutes.
* So in the last hour, the machine can produce 60 minutes / 5 minutes per pot = 12 pots.
* The difference between the number of pots produced in the last hour (12) and the first hour (10) is:
* 12 pots - 10 pots = 2 additional pots produced in the last hour.
