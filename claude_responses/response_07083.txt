Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Lois starts with 40 books.
2. She gives a fourth of her books to her nephew. A fourth of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 books. So she gives away 10 books.
3. After giving away 10 books, she has 40 - 10 = 30 books remaining.
4. From her remaining 30 books, she donates a third of them to the library. A third of 30 is 30 / 3 = 10 books. So she donates 10 books.
5. After donating 10 books, she has 30 - 10 = 20 books remaining.
6. She then purchases 3 new books from the book store.
7. So her final book count is 20 + 3 = 23 books.

Answer: 23
