Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent.
2) She spent half of her remaining monthly earnings on other expenses.
3) The rest went into her savings account.
4) We know that she spent $133 on rent, which is 7% of her monthly earnings.
5) To find her monthly earnings, we can use the formula: Monthly Earnings = Rent / 0.07
6) Monthly Earnings = $133 / 0.07 = $1,900
7) After paying rent, she has $1,900 - $133 = $1,767 left.
8) She spent half of this on other expenses, which is $1,767 / 2 = $883.50.
9) The remaining amount, which is her savings, is $1,767 - $883.50 = $883.50.

Answer: $883
