Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gunner has a box of mittens with 20 fewer pairs than a box of plugs.
2) This means that if the box of mittens has 150 pairs, the box of plugs must have 150 + 20 = 170 pairs.
3) Gunner then decides to put 30 more pairs of plugs into the box of plugs.
4) So the final number of pairs of plugs in the box is 170 + 30 = 200.

Answer: 200
