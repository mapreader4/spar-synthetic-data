Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The farmer initially has 51 cows.
2) The farmer then adds 5 new cows to the herd, so the total number of cows is now 51 + 5 = 56 cows.
3) The farmer then sells a quarter of the herd. A quarter of 56 is 56 / 4 = 14 cows.
4) So the farmer has 56 - 14 = 42 cows left.

Answer: 42
