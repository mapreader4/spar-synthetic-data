Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 3 t-shirts
* Each t-shirt costs $20
* So the total cost of the t-shirts is:
  * 3 t-shirts x $20 per t-shirt = $60
* John also buys $50 in pants
* To calculate the total amount John spends, we add the cost of the t-shirts and the cost of the pants:
  * $60 (t-shirts) + $50 (pants) = $110

Answer: $110
