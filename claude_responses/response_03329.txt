Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerry sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces.
2) The green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up.
3) Let's call the total number of pieces he sweeps up "x".
4) Since the green pieces are 25% of the total, we can say that 35 = 0.25x.
5) Solving for x, we get x = 35 / 0.25 = 140.
6) Now we know the total number of pieces he swept up is 140.
7) We also know he swept up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces.
8) To find the number of clear pieces, we subtract the amber and green pieces from the total:
140 - 20 - 35 = 85.

Answer: 85
