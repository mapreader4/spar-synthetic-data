Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) There are 50 children at the party.
2) Three-fifths of the children are boys.
3) To find the number of boys, we can multiply the total number of children (50) by the fraction of boys (3/5):
50 * (3/5) = 30 boys
4) To find the number of girls, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of children:
50 - 30 = 20 girls
Answer: 20
