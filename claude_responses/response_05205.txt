Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The marathon is 26 miles long.
2) The runner can run the first 10 miles in 1 hour.
3) For the remaining 16 miles, the runner runs at 80% of the pace they ran the first 10 miles.
4) The pace for the first 10 miles was 10 miles per hour.
5) The pace for the remaining 16 miles is 80% of 10 miles per hour, which is 8 miles per hour.
6) The time to run the remaining 16 miles at 8 miles per hour is 16 miles / 8 miles per hour = 2 hours.
7) The total time for the race is the time for the first 10 miles (1 hour) plus the time for the remaining 16 miles (2 hours), which is 3 hours.

Answer: 3 hours
