Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John pays with a $20 bill
* He buys 3 sodas
* He gets $14 in change

To find the cost of each soda, we need to first find the total cost of the 3 sodas.

* Total cost of the 3 sodas = $20 (the amount John paid) - $14 (the change he received)
* Total cost of the 3 sodas = $6

Now, to find the cost of each soda, we divide the total cost by the number of sodas:
* Cost of each soda = $6 / 3 = $2

Answer: $2
