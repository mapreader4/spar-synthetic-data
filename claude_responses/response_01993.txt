Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Georgia coughs 5 times per minute
* Robert coughs twice as much as Georgia, so he coughs 10 times per minute (2 x 5)
* We want to know the total number of coughs after 20 minutes

To calculate this, we need to find the total number of coughs for both Georgia and Robert over the 20 minute period.

For Georgia:
* Georgia coughs 5 times per minute
* Over 20 minutes, that's 5 coughs per minute x 20 minutes = 100 coughs

For Robert:
* Robert coughs 10 times per minute
* Over 20 minutes, that's 10 coughs per minute x 20 minutes = 200 coughs

Now we add the total coughs for both Georgia and Robert:
* 100 coughs (Georgia) + 200 coughs (Robert) = 300 coughs

Answer: 300
