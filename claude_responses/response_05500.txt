Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of the bedroom set is $2000.
2) Perry has $200 in gift cards that he can use towards the set, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $2000 - $200 = $1800.
3) The store is offering a 15% discount on the set, so the discounted price is $1800 * (1 - 0.15) = $1530.
4) If Perry signs up for the store credit card and uses it to buy the set, he will save an additional 10% off the discounted price. So the final price of the set is $1530 * (1 - 0.10) = $1377.

Answer: $1377
