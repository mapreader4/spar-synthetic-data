Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harold makes $2500.00 a month from his job
* His rent is $700.00
* His car payment is $300.00
* His utilities cost 1/2 the amount of his car payment, which is $150.00
* He spends $50.00 on groceries
* So his total fixed expenses are:
    - Rent: $700.00
    - Car payment: $300.00
    - Utilities: $150.00
    - Groceries: $50.00
    - Total fixed expenses: $1200.00
* His remaining income after fixed expenses is $2500.00 - $1200.00 = $1300.00
* He wants to put half of the remaining money into a retirement account, which is $1300.00 / 2 = $650.00
* So the amount of money that will be left for him is the remaining $1300.00 - $650.00 = $650.00

Answer: $650
