Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The players run up and down the bleachers 40 times.
2) Each time they run up and down, they go up and down 32 stairs one way.
3) Each stair burns 2 calories.
4) To calculate the total calories burned, we need to:
   a) Calculate the total number of stairs climbed: 40 runs x 32 stairs x 2 (up and down) = 2,560 stairs
   b) Multiply the total stairs by the calories per stair: 2,560 stairs x 2 calories/stair = 5,120 calories

Answer: 5,120
