Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jim weighs 110 pounds
* Steve is 8 pounds lighter than Jim
* So, Steve weighs 110 - 8 = 102 pounds
* Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve
* So, Stan weighs 102 + 5 = 107 pounds
* The total weight of the three of them is the sum of their individual weights:
* Jim (110 pounds) + Steve (102 pounds) + Stan (107 pounds) = 319 pounds

Answer: 319
