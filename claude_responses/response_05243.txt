Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sara bought two books:
   - Book 1 cost 5.5£
   - Book 2 cost 6.5£
2) The total cost of the two books is:
   - 5.5£ + 6.5£ = 12£
3) Sara paid with a 20£ bill.
4) To calculate the change she gets back, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
   - 20£ - 12£ = 8£

Answer: 8
