Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Andy gets 2 candy canes from his parents
* He gets 3 candy canes from each of 4 teachers, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 candy canes from the teachers
* In total, he gets 2 + 12 = 14 candy canes from his parents and teachers
* He then uses his allowance to buy 1/7 as many candy canes as he was given, which is 14 / 7 = 2 candy canes
* So the total number of candy canes he has is 14 + 2 = 16 candy canes
* We know that Andy gets a cavity for every 4 candy canes he eats
* To calculate the number of cavities, we divide the total number of candy canes (16) by 4
* 16 / 4 = 4 cavities
