Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tracy has 2 dogs
* Each dog is fed 1.5 cups of food per meal
* The dogs are fed 3 times a day
* 1 pound is equal to 2.25 cups

First, let's calculate the total amount of food consumed by both dogs per day:
* 1.5 cups per meal x 2 dogs = 3 cups per meal
* 3 cups per meal x 3 meals per day = 9 cups per day

Now, we need to convert the total cups of food consumed per day to pounds:
* 9 cups per day / 2.25 cups per pound = 4 pounds per day

Therefore, the two dogs consume 4 pounds of food per day.
