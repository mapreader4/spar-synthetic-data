Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Madison makes 30 paper boats
* 20% of the 30 boats are eaten by fish
* To calculate 20% of 30:
    - 20% = 0.20
    - 0.20 * 30 = 6
    - So 6 boats are eaten by fish
* Madison shoots 2 of the remaining boats with flaming arrows
* Originally there were 30 boats
* 6 boats were eaten by fish
* 2 boats were shot with flaming arrows
* So the number of boats left is:
    - 30 - 6 - 2 = 22

Answer: 22
