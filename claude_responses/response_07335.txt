Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sophie does 4 loads of laundry per week
* She uses 1 dryer sheet per load
* So, she uses 4 dryer sheets per week
* There are 52 weeks in a year
* So, in a year, she would use 4 dryer sheets per week x 52 weeks = 208 dryer sheets per year
* A box of dryer sheets costs $5.50 and has 104 dryer sheets
* To calculate how many boxes of dryer sheets she would need to buy in a year, we divide the 208 dryer sheets needed by the 104 dryer sheets per box:
* 208 dryer sheets / 104 dryer sheets per box = 2 boxes of dryer sheets
* Each box costs $5.50, so 2 boxes would cost 2 x $5.50 = $11.00
* Therefore, the amount of money Sophie saves in a year by not buying dryer sheets is $11.00.

Answer: $11
