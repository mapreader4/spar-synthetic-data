Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mrs. Finley's class has 24 students.
2) Mr. Johnson's class has 10 more than half the number in Mrs. Finley's class.
3) To find half the number in Mrs. Finley's class, we divide 24 by 2, which is 12.
4) Then, we add 10 to 12 to get the number of students in Mr. Johnson's class.
5) 12 + 10 = 22.

Answer: 22
