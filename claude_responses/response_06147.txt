Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 dogs in the garden
* Each dog has 4 feet
* So the total number of feet for the dogs is 6 dogs x 4 feet per dog = 24 feet

* There are 2 ducks in the garden
* Each duck has 2 feet
* So the total number of feet for the ducks is 2 ducks x 2 feet per duck = 4 feet

* To get the total number of feet in the garden, we add the feet for the dogs and the ducks:
* 24 feet (dogs) + 4 feet (ducks) = 28 feet

Answer: 28
