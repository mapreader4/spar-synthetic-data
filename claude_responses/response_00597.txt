Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has 3 half-full decks of cards
* Each half-full deck has 26 cards (half of 52)
* So the 3 half-full decks have a total of 3 * 26 = 78 cards
* John also has 3 full decks of cards
* Each full deck has 52 cards
* So the 3 full decks have a total of 3 * 52 = 156 cards
* In total, John has 78 + 156 = 234 cards
* John then decides to throw away 34 cards
* So the final number of cards John has is 234 - 34 = 200 cards

Answer: 200
