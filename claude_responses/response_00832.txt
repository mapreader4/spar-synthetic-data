Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 1000 balloons
2) Each balloon holds 10 liters of air
3) To find the total volume of air needed to fill all the balloons, we multiply the number of balloons by the volume of each balloon:
   1000 balloons x 10 liters/balloon = 10,000 liters of air
4) Each tank holds 500 liters of gas
5) To find the number of tanks needed, we divide the total volume of air needed by the volume of each tank:
   10,000 liters / 500 liters/tank = 20 tanks

Answer: 20 tanks
