Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vanessa sold 7 dresses and 4 shirts
* She made a total of $69 from the sales
* Each shirt was sold for $5

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the shirt sales:
* 4 shirts x $5 per shirt = $20

Now, we can calculate the amount earned from the dress sales:
* Total earnings = $69
* Earnings from shirts = $20
* Earnings from dresses = $69 - $20 = $49

Finally, we can calculate the price of each dress:
* 7 dresses sold for a total of $49
* Price per dress = $49 / 7 = $7

Answer: $7
