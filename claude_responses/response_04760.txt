Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John weighs one-quarter times more than what Mary weighs. This means that John's weight is 1.25 times Mary's weight.
2) Mary weighs 20 lbs less than Jamison's weight. This means that Jamison's weight is 20 lbs more than Mary's weight.
3) We are given that Mary weighs 160 lbs.
4) Since Mary weighs 160 lbs, and she weighs 20 lbs less than Jamison, Jamison's weight must be 160 + 20 = 180 lbs.
5) Since John weighs 1.25 times Mary's weight, and Mary weighs 160 lbs, John's weight must be 1.25 * 160 = 200 lbs.
6) The combined weight of the three is Mary's weight (160 lbs) + Jamison's weight (180 lbs) + John's weight (200 lbs) = 540 lbs.

Answer: 540
