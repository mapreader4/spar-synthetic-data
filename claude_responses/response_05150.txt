Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The full price of each tennis racket is $60.
* Paul bought two rackets.
* The deal is that he can buy one racket at full price and get the second one for half off.
* So, the cost of the first racket is $60 (full price).
* The cost of the second racket is $60 / 2 = $30 (half off).
* The total cost for the two rackets is $60 + $30 = $90.

Answer: $90
