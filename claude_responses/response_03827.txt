Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Twice the money Jericho has is 60, so Jericho has 30 dollars.
2) Jericho owes Annika $14.
3) Jericho also owes half as much to Manny, which is $7.
4) To pay off all his debts, Jericho needs to pay $14 to Annika and $7 to Manny, for a total of $21.
5) Jericho originally had $30, and he paid off $21 in debts.
6) Therefore, the amount of money Jericho will be left with is $30 - $21 = $9.
