Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James bought a gallon of milk for $3
* He also bought a bunch of bananas for $2
* He paid a 20% sales tax on the total cost of the milk and bananas

To calculate the total amount James spent, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the milk and bananas before tax:
   * Milk: $3
   * Bananas: $2
   * Total before tax: $3 + $2 = $5

2. Calculate the sales tax:
   * Sales tax rate: 20%
   * Sales tax amount: $5 x 0.20 = $1

3. Calculate the total amount James spent:
   * Total before tax: $5
   * Sales tax: $1
   * Total amount spent: $5 + $1 = $6

Answer: $6
