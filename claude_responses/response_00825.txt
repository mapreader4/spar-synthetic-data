Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bed frame costs $75.
2) The bed costs 10 times the price of the bed frame, which is 10 * $75 = $750.
3) James gets a 20% discount on the total price.
4) The total price before the discount is $75 + $750 = $825.
5) The discount amount is 20% of $825, which is 0.20 * $825 = $165.
6) The total amount James pays after the discount is $825 - $165 = $660.

Answer: 660
