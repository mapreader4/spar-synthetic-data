Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hawaii normally gets an average of 2 inches of rain per day
* There are 100 days left in the year
* They have already gotten 430 inches of rain

To find the normal average for the year, we can calculate:
* 2 inches per day x 365 days = 730 inches of rain per year

Now, to find how many inches on average they need to finish the year with the normal average, we can do the following:
* Total normal average for the year: 730 inches
* Rain they have already received: 430 inches
* Remaining rain needed: 730 inches - 430 inches = 300 inches
* Remaining days in the year: 100 days
* Average rain needed per day: 300 inches / 100 days = 3 inches per day

Answer: 3 inches
