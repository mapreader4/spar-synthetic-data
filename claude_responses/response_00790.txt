Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Zion's house of cards has a base of 40 centimeters and a height of 20 centimeters.
2. The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula: 1/2 * width * height.
3. So the area of Zion's house of cards is: 1/2 * 40 cm * 20 cm = 400 square centimeters.
4. Zion's two friends also built similar shaped houses, so each of their houses also has an area of 400 square centimeters.
5. The total area of the three triangular houses is the sum of the areas of the individual houses.
6. Total area = 400 sq cm + 400 sq cm + 400 sq cm = 1200 square centimeters.

Answer: 1200
