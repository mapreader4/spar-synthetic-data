Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, there were 10 apples and 5 oranges in the basket.
2) Emily adds 5 more oranges to the basket.
3) So now there are 10 apples and 10 oranges in the basket.
4) The total number of fruits in the basket is 10 + 10 = 20.
5) The number of apples is 10.
6) The percentage of apples in the basket would be (10 / 20) * 100 = 50%.

Answer: 50
