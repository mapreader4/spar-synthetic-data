Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes Bill 3 minutes to chop one pepper
* He needs to chop 4 peppers
* So the total time to chop the peppers is 4 * 3 = 12 minutes
* It takes Bill 4 minutes to chop one onion
* He needs to chop 2 onions
* So the total time to chop the onions is 2 * 4 = 8 minutes
* It takes Bill 1 minute to grate enough cheese for one omelet
* He needs to grate cheese for 5 omelets
* So the total time to grate the cheese is 5 * 1 = 5 minutes
* It takes Bill 5 minutes to assemble and cook one omelet
* He needs to cook 5 omelets
* So the total time to assemble and cook the omelets is 5 * 5 = 25 minutes
* Adding up all the times:
* Chopping peppers: 12 minutes
* Chopping onions: 8 minutes
* Grating cheese: 5 minutes
* Assembling and cooking: 25 minutes
* Total time: 12 + 8 + 5 + 25 = 50 minutes

Answer: 50 minutes
