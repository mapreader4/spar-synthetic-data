Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Colt and Curt originally prepared 113 meals.
2) Sole Mart provided an additional 50 meals.
3) So the total number of meals available is 113 + 50 = 163 meals.
4) Colt and Curt have already given away 85 meals.
5) To find the number of meals left to be distributed, we take the total number of meals (163) and subtract the number of meals already given away (85).
6) 163 - 85 = 78 meals.

Answer: 78
