Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The coyote is traveling east at 15 miles per hour
* The coyote left the footprints 1 hour ago
* Darrel is traveling east on his motorbike at 30 miles per hour

To find how long it will take for Darrel to catch up to the coyote, we need to first find how far the coyote has traveled in that 1 hour.
* Distance traveled by coyote = 15 miles per hour x 1 hour = 15 miles

Now, we need to find how long it will take Darrel to travel that 15 miles.
* Darrel's speed = 30 miles per hour
* Time taken by Darrel = Distance / Speed = 15 miles / 30 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

Therefore, it will take Darrel 0.5 hours, or 30 minutes, to catch up to the coyote.

Answer: 0.5 hours
