1) Barkley starts with 10 new dog bones at the beginning of the month.
2) After 5 months, he has 8 bones available.
3) To find how many bones he has buried, we need to subtract the number of bones he has available (8) from the total number of bones he started with (10).
4) 10 bones - 8 bones = 2 bones.
