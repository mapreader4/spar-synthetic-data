Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes.
   * If the total produce of mangoes was 400 kg, then the total produce of apples would be 2 x 400 = 800 kg.

2. The total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes.
   * If the total produce of mangoes was 400 kg, then the total produce of oranges would be 400 + 200 = 600 kg.

3. The total produce of all the fruits would be the sum of the produce of apples, mangoes, and oranges.
   * Total produce = 800 kg (apples) + 400 kg (mangoes) + 600 kg (oranges) = 1800 kg.

4. Mr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg.
   * Total amount of money he got = 1800 kg x $50 per kg = $90,000.

Answer: $90,000.
