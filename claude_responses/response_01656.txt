Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Holly's fence is 25 yards long.
2) The trees she wants to plant will be 1.5 feet wide at maturity.
3) We need to convert the fence length from yards to feet:
   * 25 yards x 3 feet/yard = 75 feet
4) Now we need to determine how many trees Holly will need to cover the 75-foot fence:
   * 75 feet / 1.5 feet per tree = 50 trees
5) Each tree costs $8.00.
6) The total cost will be:
   * 50 trees x $8.00 per tree = $400.00

Answer: $400
