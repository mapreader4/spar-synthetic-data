Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kelly held her breath for 3 minutes
* 3 minutes = 180 seconds
* Brittany held her breath for 20 seconds less than Kelly
* 180 seconds - 20 seconds = 160 seconds
* Buffy held her breath for 40 seconds less than Brittany
* 160 seconds - 40 seconds = 120 seconds

Answer: 120 seconds
