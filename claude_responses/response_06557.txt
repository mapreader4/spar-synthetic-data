Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The fisherman caught 32 bass.
2. The number of trout is 1/4 as many as the number of bass. So, the number of trout is 32 * 1/4 = 8.
3. The number of blue gill is double the number of bass. So, the number of blue gill is 32 * 2 = 64.

Now, to find the total number of fish caught, we add up the number of bass, trout, and blue gill:
32 + 8 + 64 = 104

Answer: 104
