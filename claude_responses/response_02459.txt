Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 3 workers in the factory.
2) Each worker produces 4 chairs per hour.
3) So in 1 hour, the 3 workers together produce 3 * 4 = 12 chairs.
4) In addition, the group produces an extra chair every 6 hours.
5) In 6 hours, the 3 workers would produce 12 * 6 = 72 chairs.
6) And the group would produce an additional 1 chair.
7) Therefore, the total number of chairs produced after 6 hours is 72 + 1 = 73.

Answer: 73
