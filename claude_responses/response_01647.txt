Okay, let's break this down step by step:

Sarah:
* In the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 10 times
* They passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times
* So, in the room with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection 10 x 3 = 30 times

* In the room with wide mirrors, she saw her reflection 5 times
* They passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times
* So, in the room with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection 5 x 5 = 25 times

* Total times Sarah saw her reflection = 30 + 25 = 55 times

Ellie:
* In the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 6 times
* They passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times
* So, in the room with tall mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection 6 x 3 = 18 times

* In the room with wide mirrors, she saw her reflection 3 times
* They passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times
* So, in the room with wide mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection 3 x 5 = 15 times

* Total times Ellie saw her reflection = 18 + 15 = 33 times

Total times Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections:
* Sarah: 55 times
* Ellie: 33 times
* Total: 55 + 33 = 88 times

Answer: 88
