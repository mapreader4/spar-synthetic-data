Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 804 senior high school students in total.
* 75% of the 804 students passed their exams and got their degree.
* To calculate 75% of 804, we can multiply 804 by 0.75:
    * 804 x 0.75 = 603
* So, 603 students passed their exams and got their degree.
* The remaining students are the ones who didn't pass their exams.
* To calculate the number of students who didn't pass, we subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students:
    * 804 - 603 = 201

Answer: 201
