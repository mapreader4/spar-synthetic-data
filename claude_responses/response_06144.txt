Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 20 kids in preschool ready for a nap
* 1/2 of the kids fall asleep within the first 5 minutes
* 1/2 of the remaining kids fall asleep within another 5 minutes

First, let's calculate how many kids fell asleep in the first 5 minutes:
* 1/2 of 20 kids = 10 kids

Now, let's calculate how many kids were left after the first 5 minutes:
* 20 kids - 10 kids = 10 kids

Next, let's calculate how many of those 10 kids fell asleep in the next 5 minutes:
* 1/2 of 10 kids = 5 kids

Finally, let's calculate how many kids are still awake:
* 10 kids - 5 kids = 5 kids

Answer: 5
