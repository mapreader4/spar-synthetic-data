Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Connor earns $7.20 per hour.
2) Sarah makes 5 times more money per hour than Connor.
3) To calculate Sarah's hourly rate, we multiply Connor's hourly rate by 5:
   $7.20 x 5 = $36.00 per hour
4) Sarah works an 8-hour day.
5) To calculate Sarah's earnings for the 8-hour day, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours worked:
   $36.00 x 8 = $288.00

Answer: $288
