Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jacoby needs to have $5000 total to go on his trip.
2. He works a job earning $20 per hour and works 10 hours.
   * So, his earnings from his job are: $20 x 10 hours = $200
3. He then sells 24 cookies at $4 each.
   * His earnings from selling cookies are: $4 x 24 = $96
4. He buys a lottery ticket for $10 and wins $500.
   * His net earnings from the lottery are: $500 - $10 = $490
5. He gets $500 from both of his sisters as a gift.
   * His total earnings from his sisters are: $500 x 2 = $1000
6. Now, let's add up all his earnings:
   * $200 + $96 + $490 + $1000 = $1786
7. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract his total earnings from the $5000 he needs:
   * $5000 - $1786 = $3214

Answer: $3214
