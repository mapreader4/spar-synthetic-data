Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 4 students who participated in the 200m race
* The average completion time of the last three students was 35 seconds
* The average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds

To find the time it took the student who came first to finish the race, we can use the following equation:

(Time of first student + 3 * 35 seconds) / 4 = 30 seconds

Rearranging this equation, we get:

Time of first student = 4 * 30 seconds - 3 * 35 seconds
Time of first student = 120 seconds - 105 seconds
Time of first student = 15 seconds

Answer: 15 seconds
