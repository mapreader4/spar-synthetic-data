Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 400 students at the party
* The students are a combination of poets, singers, and tree huggers
* There are 50 more poets than tree huggers
* The number of tree huggers is 120

First, let's find the number of poets:
* The number of poets = number of tree huggers + 50
* The number of poets = 120 + 50 = 170

Now, we can find the total number of poets and tree huggers:
* Total number of poets and tree huggers = 170 + 120 = 290

Finally, we can find the number of singers:
* Number of singers = Total students - Total poets and tree huggers
* Number of singers = 400 - 290 = 110

Answer: 110
