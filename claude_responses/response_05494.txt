Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cost of an adult ticket is $8
* The cost of a child's ticket is $3
* The adult has $35 to spend
* We need to find out how many children the adult can take with her

First, we need to determine how much the adult ticket will cost:
* 1 adult ticket = $8

Now, we need to determine how much money is left for the children's tickets:
* Total money available = $35
* Money spent on adult ticket = $8
* Money left for children's tickets = $35 - $8 = $27

Now, we need to determine how many children's tickets can be purchased with the remaining $27:
* Cost of 1 child's ticket = $3
* Number of children's tickets that can be purchased = $27 / $3 = 9

Therefore, the adult can take 9 children with her to the movies.

Answer: 9
