Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has enough hats to wear a different one every day for 2 weeks
* 2 weeks = 14 days
* Therefore, John has 14 hats
* Each hat costs $50
* To calculate the total cost of the hats, we multiply the number of hats (14) by the cost per hat ($50)

Answer: 14 x $50 = $700
