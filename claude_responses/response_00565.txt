Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total distance of the road trip is 1000 miles.
2) Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice the amount that Michelle drives.
   * Let's call the amount that Michelle drives as "x" miles.
   * Then, the amount that Tracy drives is 2x + 20 miles.
3) Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives.
   * So, the amount that Katie drives is x/3 miles.
4) We know that the total distance of the road trip is 1000 miles.
   * Therefore, the sum of the miles driven by Tracy, Michelle, and Katie must equal 1000 miles.
   * So, we can write the equation: 2x + 20 + x + x/3 = 1000
5) Solving for x, we get:
   * 3x + 20 + x/3 = 1000
   * 3.33x + 20 = 1000
   * 3.33x = 980
   * x = 294

Answer: 294 miles
