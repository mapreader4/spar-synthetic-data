Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim gets 6 hours of sleep for 2 days in a row
* So for those 2 days, he got a total of 6 hours x 2 days = 12 hours of sleep
* To make up for it, he sleeps 10 hours for the next 2 days
* So for those 2 days, he got a total of 10 hours x 2 days = 20 hours of sleep
* To calculate the total amount of sleep Tim got, we add the 12 hours from the first 2 days and the 20 hours from the next 2 days:
* 12 hours + 20 hours = 32 hours

Answer: 32
