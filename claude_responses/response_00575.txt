Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The package of candy has 3 servings
* Each serving has 120 calories
* John eats half the package
* To find the total calories John ate, we need to:
  1. Calculate the total calories in the full package
  2. Divide that by 2 to get the calories in half the package

Step 1: Calculate the total calories in the full package
* Each serving has 120 calories
* There are 3 servings in the package
* Total calories in the package = 3 servings x 120 calories per serving = 360 calories

Step 2: Divide the total calories by 2 to get the calories in half the package
* Total calories in half the package = 360 calories / 2 = 180 calories

Answer: 180 calories
