Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first year, the apple tree produced 40 apples.

2. In the second year, the apple tree produced 8 more than double the amount of apples it produced in the first year. 
   - The amount of apples produced in the first year was 40.
   - Double that amount is 40 x 2 = 80.
   - Adding 8 more, the total amount of apples produced in the second year is 80 + 8 = 88.

3. In the third year, the production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation.
   - The amount of apples produced in the second year was 88.
   - A fourth of 88 is 88 / 4 = 22.
   - Subtracting 22 from 88, the total amount of apples produced in the third year is 88 - 22 = 66.

Now, to calculate the total number of apples produced in the first three years:
   - First year: 40 apples
   - Second year: 88 apples
   - Third year: 66 apples
   - Total: 40 + 88 + 66 = 194 apples

Answer: 194
