Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The lifespan of a hamster is 6 years less than that of a bat.
2) The lifespan of a frog is 4 times that of a hamster.
3) The total lifespan of all the animals is 30 years.

Let's start by finding the lifespan of the hamster.
* If the lifespan of the bat is x years, then the lifespan of the hamster is x - 6 years.
* The lifespan of the frog is 4 times the lifespan of the hamster, so the lifespan of the frog is 4(x - 6) years.
* The total lifespan of all the animals is 30 years, so we can write the equation:
x + (x - 6) + 4(x - 6) = 30
* Simplifying this equation, we get:
6x - 24 = 30
* Solving for x, we get:
6x = 54
x = 9

Therefore, the lifespan of the bat is 9 years.

Answer: 9
