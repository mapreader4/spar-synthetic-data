Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The jug needs 40 cups of water to be full.
2) There are 200 students at Truman Elementary School.
3) Each student drinks 10 cups of water in a day.
4) To calculate the total amount of water needed for all 200 students in a day, we multiply the number of students (200) by the amount of water each student drinks (10 cups):
   200 students x 10 cups = 2,000 cups of water needed per day.
5) To determine how many water jugs the custodian needs to fill, we divide the total amount of water needed (2,000 cups) by the capacity of each jug (40 cups):
   2,000 cups / 40 cups per jug = 50 jugs.

Answer: 50
