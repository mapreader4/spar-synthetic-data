Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Original order before delivery and tip: $25
2. Substitutions:
   - Tomatoes: $2.20 - $0.99 = $1.21 increase
   - Lettuce: $1.75 - $1.00 = $0.75 increase
   - Celery: $2.00 - $1.96 = $0.04 increase
3. Total increase in item costs: $1.21 + $0.75 + $0.04 = $2.00
4. New subtotal of order: $25 + $2.00 = $27.00
5. Delivery and tip: $8.00

Therefore, the new bill with the food substitutes and delivery/tip is:
Answer: $35
