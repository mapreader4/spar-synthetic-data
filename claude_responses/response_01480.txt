Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Oli has 4 scoops of ice cream in his banana split
* Victoria has twice as many scoops of ice cream as Oli
* To find how many more scoops of ice cream Victoria has than Oli, we need to calculate the difference between the number of scoops they each have

First, let's calculate how many scoops of ice cream Victoria has:
* Victoria has twice as many scoops as Oli
* Oli has 4 scoops
* Therefore, Victoria has 2 x 4 = 8 scoops of ice cream

Now, to find the difference between the number of scoops they each have:
* Victoria has 8 scoops
* Oli has 4 scoops
* The difference is 8 - 4 = 4 scoops

Answer: 4
