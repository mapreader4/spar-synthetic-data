Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes 3 men an hour to complete 1 job
* The company has hired them to work on 5 similar jobs
* Each man is paid $10 per hour

To calculate the total amount of money the three men will earn, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of hours it will take to complete all 5 jobs
2. Multiply the total number of hours by the hourly rate of $10 per man

Step 1: Calculating the total number of hours
* It takes 3 men 1 hour to complete 1 job
* There are 5 jobs to complete
* Therefore, it will take 3 men 5 hours to complete all 5 jobs

Step 2: Calculating the total amount earned
* Each man earns $10 per hour
* There are 3 men
* They worked for a total of 5 hours
* Therefore, the total amount earned is:
   - 3 men x $10 per hour x 5 hours = $150

Answer: $150
