Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The distance between Robin's house and the city center is 500 meters.
2) Robin leaves his house and walks 200 meters towards the city center.
3) He then realizes he forgot his bag and returns to his house.
4) The distance he walked from his house to the point where he realized he forgot his bag is 200 meters.
5) To return to his house, he needs to walk another 200 meters.
6) Now he has to walk the full 500 meters to the city center.
7) So the total distance he walks is:
   - 200 meters to the point where he realized he forgot his bag
   - 200 meters back to his house
   - 500 meters to the city center
8) Adding these up, the total distance he walks is:
   200 + 200 + 500 = 900 meters

Answer: 900
