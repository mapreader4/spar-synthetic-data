Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Felicity needs 400 sticks to finish her fort
* She gets a lollipop every time she goes to the store
* Her family goes to the store 3 times a week, and she always goes with them
* The fort is currently 60% complete

First, we need to find out how many sticks she has collected so far. Since the fort is 60% complete, we can calculate this by taking 60% of the total number of sticks needed:
* 60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240 sticks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it has taken her to collect 240 sticks. We know that she gets a lollipop every time she goes to the store, and her family goes 3 times a week, so she gets 3 lollipops per week.
* 240 sticks / 3 sticks per week = 80 weeks

Therefore, Felicity has been collecting lollipops for 80 weeks.

Answer: 80
