Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Beth had 150 students in her 10th-grade class.
* The following year, 30 more students joined the class.
* So, the total number of students in the 11th-grade class was 150 + 30 = 180.
* In her final year, 15 students left the class.
* So, the total number of students in the final year class was 180 - 15 = 165.

Answer: 165
