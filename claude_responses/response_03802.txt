Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Claire won a $100 gift card
* She wants to treat herself to a latte that costs $3.75 and a croissant for $3.50 every morning for a week
* That means she will spend $3.75 + $3.50 = $7.25 per day
* For a week (7 days), that's 7 * $7.25 = $50.75
* She also plans to buy 5 cookies that cost $1.25 each
* That's 5 * $1.25 = $6.25
* So the total amount she will spend is $50.75 + $6.25 = $57.00
* The initial amount on the gift card was $100
* After her purchases, the amount left on the card will be $100 - $57.00 = $43.00

Answer: $43
