Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jean bought 4 packs of 15 cupcakes each.
2) So the total number of cupcakes she bought from the 4 packs of 15 is:
4 packs x 15 cupcakes per pack = 60 cupcakes
3) She needs to give one cupcake each to 100 children.
4) So the total number of cupcakes she needs is 100.
5) To find how many packs of 10 cupcakes she needs to buy, we need to subtract the 60 cupcakes she already has from the 100 cupcakes she needs.
6) 100 cupcakes needed - 60 cupcakes already bought = 40 cupcakes still needed.
7) Since each pack of 10 cupcakes contains 10 cupcakes, we need to divide the 40 cupcakes still needed by 10 to find the number of packs she needs to buy.
8) 40 cupcakes needed / 10 cupcakes per pack = 4 packs of 10 cupcakes.
