Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Justin has 14 dogs
2) Rico has 10 more dogs than Justin, so Rico has 14 + 10 = 24 dogs
3) Camden bought 3/4 times as many dogs as Rico, so Camden has 3/4 * 24 = 18 dogs
4) Each dog has 4 legs
5) The total number of legs that Camden's dogs have is 18 dogs * 4 legs per dog = 72 legs

Answer: 72
