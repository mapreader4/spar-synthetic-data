Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The family's water and electricity bills average $30 a month for the first 4 months
* The family's water and electricity bills average $24 a month for the last 2 months
* We need to find the average monthly bill over all 6 months

To calculate the average monthly bill over all 6 months, we need to find the total amount spent over the 6 months and divide it by 6.

The total amount spent over the 6 months is:
* 4 months at $30 per month = $120
* 2 months at $24 per month = $48
* Total = $120 + $48 = $168

Now, to find the average monthly bill, we divide the total by 6 months:
* $168 / 6 months = $28 per month

Answer: 28
