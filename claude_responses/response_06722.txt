Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Yesterday, Vincent bought 15 packs of stickers.
2) Today, he bought 10 more packs of stickers than yesterday.
3) To calculate how many packs he bought today, we take the number he bought yesterday (15) and add 10 more.
4) 15 + 10 = 25 packs of stickers bought today.
5) To find the total number of packs of stickers Vincent has, we add the number he bought yesterday (15) to the number he bought today (25).
6) 15 + 25 = 40 packs of stickers altogether.

Answer: 40
