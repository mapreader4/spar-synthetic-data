Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Last year, Dallas was 3 times the age of his sister Darcy.
2) Darcy is twice as old as Dexter, who is 8 right now.
3) So, Darcy's age is 2 * 8 = 16.
4) Last year, Dallas was 3 times Darcy's age, which was 16. So, last year Dallas was 3 * 16 = 48.
5) This year, Dallas is 1 year older than last year, so Dallas is now 48 + 1 = 49 years old.

Answer: 49
