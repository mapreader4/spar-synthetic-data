Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* We know that 12 bags of oranges weigh 24 pounds
* We want to find out how much 8 bags of oranges weigh
* To do this, we can set up a proportion:
* 12 bags / 24 pounds = 8 bags / x pounds
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 12 * x = 24 * 8
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = (24 * 8) / 12
* x = 16 pounds

Answer: 16 pounds
