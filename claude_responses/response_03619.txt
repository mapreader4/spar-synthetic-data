Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cost of one cup of coffee is $6
* The cost of one piece of cheesecake is $10
* When buying them together, the client gets a 25% discount
* To calculate the final price, we first need to find the total cost without the discount:
    - Total cost = Cost of coffee + Cost of cheesecake
    - Total cost = $6 + $10 = $16
* Now, we apply the 25% discount:
    - Discount amount = 25% of $16 = 0.25 * $16 = $4
    - Final price = Total cost - Discount amount = $16 - $4 = $12

Answer: $12
