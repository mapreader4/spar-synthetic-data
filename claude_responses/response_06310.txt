Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that the combined weight of Tracy, John, and Jake is 158 kg.
2) We also know that Tracy weighs 52 kg.
3) We know that Jake weighs 8 kg more than Tracy, so Jake's weight is 52 + 8 = 60 kg.
4) Now we can calculate John's weight by subtracting Tracy's and Jake's weights from the total weight:
   Total weight = 158 kg
   Tracy's weight = 52 kg
   Jake's weight = 60 kg
   John's weight = 158 - 52 - 60 = 46 kg
5) The range of their weights is the difference between the heaviest and lightest weights.
   The heaviest weight is Jake at 60 kg.
   The lightest weight is John at 46 kg.
   The range is 60 - 46 = 14 kg.

Answer: 14 kg
