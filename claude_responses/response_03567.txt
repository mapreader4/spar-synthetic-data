Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) 400 students showed up to the party.
2) 70% of the 400 students who showed up were invited.
   * 70% of 400 = 0.70 * 400 = 280 students were invited.
3) 40% of the 280 invited students had their invitation revoked and were not allowed into the party.
   * 40% of 280 = 0.40 * 280 = 112 students had their invitation revoked.
4) The number of invited students who attended the party is the total number of invited students (280) minus the number of students who had their invitation revoked (112).
   * 280 - 112 = 168 invited students attended the party.

Answer: 168
