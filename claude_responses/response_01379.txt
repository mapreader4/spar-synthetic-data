Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. During the first spring, Lola had 10 breeding rabbits.
2. Each of the 10 breeding rabbits had 10 kittens, so the total number of kittens was 10 x 10 = 100 kittens.
3. Half of the 100 kittens were adopted, so 50 kittens were adopted.
4. 5 of the adopted kittens had to be returned to Lola.
5. So, the number of kittens Lola had after the first spring was 100 - 50 + 5 = 55 kittens.
6. During the next spring, Lola's 10 breeding rabbits had a total of 60 kittens.
7. 4 of those 60 kittens were adopted.
8. So, the number of kittens Lola had after the second spring was 60 - 4 = 56 kittens.
9. In total, Lola has 10 breeding rabbits and 55 + 56 = 111 kittens.
