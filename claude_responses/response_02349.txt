Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. The burger meal costs $6.
2. The soda costs 1/3 as much as the burger meal, which means it costs $2 (1/3 of $6).
3. Paulo wants to get one burger meal and one soda.
4. Jeremy asked Paulo to get him 2 of each item Paulo is going to get.
5. So, for Paulo, the total cost is $6 (burger meal) + $2 (soda) = $8.
6. For Jeremy, the total cost is 2 x $6 (2 burger meals) + 2 x $2 (2 sodas) = $16.
7. The combined total cost for both Paulo and Jeremy is $8 + $16 = $24.
