Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Lalande inherited 20,000 euros from his aunt Adeline.
2) The car he wants to buy costs 18,000 euros.
3) He pays 3,000 euros upfront to take the car.
4) The remaining amount he needs to pay is 18,000 - 3,000 = 15,000 euros.
5) He will pay this remaining 15,000 euros in 6 monthly installments.
6) To calculate the monthly installment, we divide the remaining amount by the number of months:
15,000 euros / 6 months = 2,500 euros per month.

Answer: 2,500 euros
