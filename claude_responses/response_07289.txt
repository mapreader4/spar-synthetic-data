Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ursula bought 5 hot dogs at $1.50 each. So the total cost of the hot dogs is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
2) Ursula also bought 3 salads at $2.50 each. So the total cost of the salads is 3 * $2.50 = $7.50.
3) The total cost of the hot dogs and salads is $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.00.
4) Ursula had two $10 bills, which is a total of $20.
5) To calculate the change, we take the total amount Ursula had ($20) and subtract the total cost ($15.00).
6) $20 - $15.00 = $5.00.
