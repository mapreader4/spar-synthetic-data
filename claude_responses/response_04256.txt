Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim does 100 tasks a day
* Each task pays $1.2
* He works 6 days a week

To calculate his weekly earnings, we need to:
1. Calculate his daily earnings
2. Multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works per week

Step 1: Calculate his daily earnings
* 100 tasks per day x $1.2 per task = $120 per day

Step 2: Multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works per week
* $120 per day x 6 days per week = $720 per week

Answer: $720
