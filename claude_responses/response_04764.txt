Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Happy is currently drinking 15 cups of water every week
* Her doctor has recommended that she increase her water intake by 40%
* To calculate the recommended number of cups per week, we need to find 40% of 15 cups and add it to the current amount

To find 40% of 15 cups:
* 40% of 15 = 0.4 * 15 = 6 cups

Now, we add the 6 cups to the current 15 cups:
* 15 cups + 6 cups = 21 cups

Therefore, the recommended number of cups of water per week is 21 cups.

Answer: 21
