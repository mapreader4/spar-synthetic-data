Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The school bus traveled for 42 minutes
* The speed of the bus was 50 mph
* To find the distance traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time
* 50 mph x 42 minutes = 2,100 miles per hour
* However, the question asks for the distance in miles, not miles per hour
* To convert miles per hour to miles, we need to divide the miles per hour by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
* 2,100 miles per hour / 60 minutes = 35 miles

Answer: 35 miles
