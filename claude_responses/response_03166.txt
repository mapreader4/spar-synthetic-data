Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Louise has 30 pictures to hang on the wall
* She hangs some of them vertically
* She hangs half of them horizontally
* She hangs the remaining 5 pictures haphazardly

First, let's find out how many pictures she hangs horizontally:
* Half of 30 pictures is 15 pictures

Now, we know that she hangs the remaining 5 pictures haphazardly, so the number of pictures she hangs vertically must be the difference between the total number of pictures and the number of pictures hung horizontally and haphazardly.
* Total pictures: 30
* Pictures hung horizontally: 15
* Pictures hung haphazardly: 5
* Pictures hung vertically: 30 - 15 - 5 = 10
