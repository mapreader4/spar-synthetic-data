Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenny is older than Charlie by 5 years.
2) Charlie is older than Bobby by 3 years.
3) We want to find out how old Charlie will be when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby.
4) Let's say Bobby's current age is x.
5) Then Charlie's age is x + 3, and Jenny's age is x + 3 + 5 = x + 8.
6) We want to find the value of x when Jenny's age is twice Bobby's age, which means x + 8 = 2x.
7) Solving for x, we get x = 8.
8) So Bobby's age is 8, Charlie's age is 8 + 3 = 11, and Jenny's age is 8 + 5 = 13.
