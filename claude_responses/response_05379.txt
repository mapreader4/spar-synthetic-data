Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gina tipped 5% on a bill of $26
* To calculate the 5% tip, we take 5% of $26:
    - 5% of $26 = 0.05 x $26 = $1.30
* Good tippers tip at least 20%
* To calculate the 20% tip, we take 20% of $26:
    - 20% of $26 = 0.20 x $26 = $5.20
* The difference between the 20% tip and the 5% tip is:
    - $5.20 - $1.30 = $3.90
* Therefore, Gina would have to tip $3.90 more than her normal 5% tip to be considered a good tipper.

Answer: $3.90
