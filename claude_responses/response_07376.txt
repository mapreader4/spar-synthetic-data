Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janette went camping for 5 days
* She brought 40 pieces of beef jerky
* She plans to eat 1 for breakfast, 1 for lunch, and 2 for dinner each day
* So, each day she will eat 4 pieces of beef jerky (1 for breakfast, 1 for lunch, and 2 for dinner)
* Over the 5 days, she will eat a total of 4 pieces x 5 days = 20 pieces of beef jerky
* After the 5 days, she will have 40 - 20 = 20 pieces of beef jerky remaining
* She plans to give half of the remaining pieces to her brother
* Half of 20 is 10
* So, she will give 10 pieces to her brother, and she will have 20 - 10 = 10 pieces of beef jerky left.
