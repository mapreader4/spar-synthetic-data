Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Johnson has a prescription with enough pills for 30 days
* After four-fifths of the days, he has 12 pills left
* We need to find out how many pills he is supposed to take a day if he takes the same dose daily

First, let's calculate how many days have passed when he has 12 pills left:
* Four-fifths of 30 days is 24 days
* So, he has 12 pills left after 24 days

Now, we can calculate how many pills he took in total:
* He started with enough pills for 30 days
* He has 12 pills left after 24 days
* So, he took 30 - 12 = 18 pills in the first 24 days

Finally, we can calculate how many pills he was supposed to take per day:
* He took 18 pills in 24 days
* So, he took 18 / 24 = 0.75 pills per day

Therefore, the number of pills Mr. Johnson is supposed to take per day is:
Answer: 1
