Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maurice gets $2 for every finished task
* For every 10 tasks finished, he receives a $6 bonus
* He finished 30 tasks

First, let's calculate how much he would make for the 30 tasks without the bonus:
* 30 tasks x $2 per task = $60

Next, let's calculate the bonus he would receive:
* 30 tasks / 10 tasks per bonus = 3 bonuses
* 3 bonuses x $6 per bonus = $18

Finally, to get the total amount of money Maurice would make, we add the amount for the tasks and the bonus:
* $60 + $18 = $78

Answer: $78
