Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The ball is dropped from a 96-foot tall building.
2) On the first bounce, the ball reaches a height of 96/2 = 48 feet.
3) On the second bounce, the ball reaches a height of 48/2 = 24 feet.
4) On the third bounce, the ball reaches a height of 24/2 = 12 feet.
5) On the fourth bounce, the ball reaches a height of 12/2 = 6 feet.
6) On the fifth bounce, the ball reaches a height of 6/2 = 3 feet.

Answer: 3 feet
