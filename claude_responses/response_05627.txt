Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Genevieve has written 4300 lines of code so far
* Every 100 lines of code, she debugs the program
* Each debugging finds 3 errors
* Genevieve fixes the errors each time before proceeding

To find the total number of errors fixed, we need to determine how many times Genevieve has debugged the program.

The number of times Genevieve has debugged the program is equal to the total number of lines of code divided by the number of lines of code per debugging session:
* 4300 lines of code / 100 lines of code per debugging session = 43 debugging sessions

Now, we know that each debugging session finds 3 errors, so the total number of errors fixed is:
* 43 debugging sessions * 3 errors per session = 129 errors fixed

Answer: 129
