Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Robi started saving $2 in January.
2) In February, he saved $4, which is double the amount he saved in January.
3) In March, he saved $8, which is double the amount he saved in February.
4) This pattern continues, where each month's savings is double the previous month's savings.
5) So, the savings for each month are:
   - January: $2
   - February: $4
   - March: $8
   - April: $16
   - May: $32
   - June: $64
6) To find the total savings after 6 months, we add up the savings for each month:
   $2 + $4 + $8 + $16 + $32 + $64 = $126

Answer: 126
