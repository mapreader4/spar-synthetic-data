Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Milly needs to fold the dough 4 times, and each folding takes 5 minutes.
2) So the total time for folding the dough is 4 x 5 minutes = 20 minutes.
3) After each folding, the dough needs to rest for 75 minutes.
4) So the total time for resting the dough is 4 x 75 minutes = 300 minutes.
5) Mixing the ingredients takes 10 minutes.
6) Baking the croissants takes 30 minutes.
7) To calculate the total time, we add up all the steps:
   - Folding the dough: 20 minutes
   - Resting the dough: 300 minutes
   - Mixing the ingredients: 10 minutes
   - Baking the croissants: 30 minutes
8) The total time is 20 + 300 + 10 + 30 = 360 minutes.
9) Converting 360 minutes to hours, we get 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Answer: 6 hours
