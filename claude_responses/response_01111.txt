Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Barbara asked for 4 1/2 pound steaks that cost $15.00 per pound.
   * To calculate the cost of the steaks, we multiply the weight (4 1/2 pounds) by the price per pound ($15.00):
   * 4 1/2 pounds x $15.00/pound = $67.50

2. Barbara also asked for 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts that cost $8.00 per pound.
   * To calculate the cost of the chicken breasts, we multiply the weight (1 1/2 pounds) by the price per pound ($8.00):
   * 1 1/2 pounds x $8.00/pound = $12.00

3. To find the total amount Barbara spent at the butcher, we add the cost of the steaks and the chicken breasts:
   * $67.50 + $12.00 = $79.50

Answer: $79.50
