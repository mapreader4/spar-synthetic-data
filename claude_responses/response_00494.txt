Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The smaller house is 5,200 sq. ft.
* The larger house is 7,300 sq. ft.
* The new total square footage of both houses is 16,000 sq. ft.

To find how much the smaller house is being expanded by, we need to:
1. Calculate the total square footage of the two houses before the expansion.
2. Subtract the total square footage before the expansion from the new total square footage of 16,000 sq. ft.

Step 1: Calculate the total square footage before the expansion.
* Total square footage before expansion = 5,200 sq. ft. + 7,300 sq. ft. = 12,500 sq. ft.

Step 2: Calculate the increase in square footage.
* Increase in square footage = New total square footage - Total square footage before expansion
* Increase in square footage = 16,000 sq. ft. - 12,500 sq. ft. = 3,500 sq. ft.

Therefore, the smaller house is being expanded by 3,500 sq. ft.

Answer: 3,500
