Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 50 marbles in the box
* Originally, there were 20 white marbles
* The number of red and blue marbles were equal
* So, the number of red and blue marbles is (50 - 20) / 2 = 15 each
* Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles
* The difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles is 20 - 15 = 5
* Jack removes 2 * 5 = 10 marbles
* The remaining number of marbles in the box is 50 - 10 = 40

Answer: 40
