Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alex has 2 cakes, each cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.
2) A fourth of the 16 slices are given away to his friends. A fourth of 16 is 4, so 4 slices are given away to his friends.
3) That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 slices remaining.
4) A third of the remaining 12 slices are given away to his family. A third of 12 is 4, so 4 more slices are given away.
5) That leaves 12 - 4 = 8 slices remaining.
6) Alex eats 3 of those 8 slices.
7) So the final number of slices left is 8 - 3 = 5 slices.
