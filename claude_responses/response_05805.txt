Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Youngsville had an initial population of 684 people.
2) The population then increased by 25%. To calculate the new population after the 25% increase:
   - 25% of 684 = 0.25 * 684 = 171
   - New population = 684 + 171 = 855
3) After the growth spurt, 40% of the population moved away. To calculate the new population after the 40% decrease:
   - 40% of 855 = 0.40 * 855 = 342
   - New population = 855 - 342 = 513
Answer: 513
