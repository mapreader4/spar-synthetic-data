Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Julie wants to buy a mountain bike that costs $2345.
2. She has already saved $1500.
3. She plans to earn additional money by:
   - Mowing 20 lawns at $20 each, which is 20 * $20 = $400
   - Delivering 600 newspapers at 40 cents each, which is 600 * $0.40 = $240
   - Walking 24 dogs at $15 each, which is 24 * $15 = $360
4. The total amount she will earn from these additional tasks is $400 + $240 + $360 = $1000.
5. The total amount of money Julie will have is the $1500 she has saved, plus the $1000 she will earn, which is $1500 + $1000 = $2500.
6. The cost of the mountain bike is $2345.
7. After purchasing the bike, the amount of money Julie will have left is $2500 - $2345 = $155.
