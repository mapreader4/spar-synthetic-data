Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John's dog had a litter of 8 puppies
* He gave away half of the puppies, which is 4 puppies
* He kept 1 of the remaining 4 puppies
* He sold the remaining 3 puppies for $600 each
* He had to pay the owner of the stud $300

So, the total revenue from selling the 3 puppies is:
* 3 puppies x $600 per puppy = $1,800

The total cost is:
* $300 paid to the stud owner

To calculate the profit, we take the total revenue and subtract the total cost:
* $1,800 - $300 = $1,500

Answer: $1,500
