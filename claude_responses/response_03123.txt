Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Madeline wants to drink 100 ounces of water in a day.
2) Her water bottle can hold 12 ounces of water.
3) She refills her water bottle 7 times.
4) To calculate the total amount of water she has drunk from refilling her water bottle 7 times:
   * Each time she refills her water bottle, she drinks 12 ounces.
   * 7 refills x 12 ounces = 84 ounces.
5) To calculate how much more water she needs to drink:
   * She wants to drink 100 ounces total.
   * She has already drunk 84 ounces.
   * 100 ounces - 84 ounces = 16 ounces.
