Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April
* In May, she sold half as many clips as she did in April
* To find the number of clips sold in May, we take the number of clips sold in April (48) and divide it by 2:
    * 48 / 2 = 24 clips sold in May
* To find the total number of clips sold in April and May, we add the number of clips sold in April (48) and the number of clips sold in May (24):
    * 48 + 24 = 72 clips sold altogether

Answer: 72
