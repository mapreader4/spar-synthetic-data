Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. During high season, 6 packs of tuna are sold per hour.
2. During low season, 4 packs of tuna are sold per hour.
3. Each tuna pack is sold at $60.
4. The fish are sold for 15 hours per day.

To calculate the difference in money made during high season vs. low season:

High season:
* 6 packs per hour x $60 per pack = $360 per hour
* $360 per hour x 15 hours = $5,400 per day

Low season:
* 4 packs per hour x $60 per pack = $240 per hour
* $240 per hour x 15 hours = $3,600 per day

Difference:
* $5,400 per day (high season) - $3,600 per day (low season) = $1,800 more per day during high season

Answer: $1,800
