Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emery can read 5 times as fast as Serena
* It takes Emery 20 days to read the book
* We need to find the average number of days the two take to read the book

First, let's find how long it takes Serena to read the book:
* If Emery can read 5 times as fast as Serena, then Serena must take 5 times as long as Emery to read the book
* So, if it takes Emery 20 days, it must take Serena 20 x 5 = 100 days to read the book

Now, we can calculate the average number of days:
* Emery takes 20 days
* Serena takes 100 days
* The total number of days is 20 + 100 = 120 days
* The average number of days is 120 / 2 = 60 days

Answer: 60
