Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Frankie and Carla played a total of 30 games.
2) Frankie won half as many games as Carla.
3) Let's say Carla won x games.
4) Since Frankie won half as many games as Carla, Frankie won x/2 games.
5) The total number of games won is the sum of the games won by Carla and Frankie, which is x + x/2 = 30.
6) Solving for x, we get: x + x/2 = 30
7) 3x/2 = 30
8) x = 20.

Answer: 20
