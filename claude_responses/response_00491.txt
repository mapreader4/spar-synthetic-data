Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jess has to walk 11 blocks to the store
* Then she has to walk 6 blocks to the gallery
* Finally, she has to walk 8 blocks to arrive at work
* So the total number of blocks Jess has to walk is 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 blocks
* Jess has already walked 5 blocks
* Therefore, the number of blocks Jess has left to walk is 25 - 5 = 20 blocks

Answer: 20
