Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* One time around the block equals 200 meters
* Johnny runs around the block 4 times
* Mickey runs around the block half as many times as Johnny

First, let's calculate the total distance run by Johnny:
* Johnny runs around the block 4 times
* 4 times around the block x 200 meters per lap = 800 meters

Next, let's calculate the total distance run by Mickey:
* Mickey runs around the block half as many times as Johnny
* Half of 4 times is 2 times
* 2 times around the block x 200 meters per lap = 400 meters

Now, to calculate the average distance run by Johnny and Mickey, we add their distances and divide by 2:
* (800 meters + 400 meters) / 2 = 600 meters

Answer: 600
