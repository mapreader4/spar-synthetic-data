Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The group of students was divided into 3 groups of 8 students each
* So the total number of students in the group was 3 * 8 = 24 students
* However, 2 students left early
* So the number of students remaining is the original total (24) minus the 2 students who left
* 24 - 2 = 22 students

Answer: 22
