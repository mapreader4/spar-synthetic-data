Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Steve's new book sells 1,000,000 copies
* He got an advance to pay for 100,000 copies
* He gets $2 for each copy of the book sold
* His agent takes 10% of that

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the book sales:
* 1,000,000 copies sold x $2 per copy = $2,000,000 total revenue

Next, let's calculate the agent's commission:
* 10% of $2,000,000 = $200,000

Now, let's calculate the amount Steve kept, not counting the money from the advance:
* Total revenue: $2,000,000
* Agent's commission: $200,000
* Amount Steve kept: $2,000,000 - $200,000 = $1,800,000

Answer: $1,800,000
