Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ariella has $200 more in her son's savings account than Daniella has in her son's savings account.
2) Daniella has $400 in her son's savings account.
3) Therefore, Ariella has $400 + $200 = $600 in her son's savings account.
4) Ariella's account earns simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum.
5) Simple interest formula: I = Prt, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, and t is the time.
6) In this case, P = $600, r = 0.10 (10%), and t = 2 years.
7) Plugging these values into the formula:
I = $600 * 0.10 * 2 = $120
8) The total amount Ariella will have after two years is the principal plus the interest:
$600 + $120 = $720.

Answer: 720
