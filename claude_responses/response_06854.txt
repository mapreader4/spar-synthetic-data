Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The TV show has been going on for 14 years
* Out of those 14 years:
    - 8 seasons had 15 episodes each
    - 4 seasons had 20 episodes each
    - 2 seasons had 12 episodes each
* To calculate the total number of episodes:
    - 8 seasons x 15 episodes = 120 episodes
    - 4 seasons x 20 episodes = 80 episodes
    - 2 seasons x 12 episodes = 24 episodes
* The total number of episodes is 120 + 80 + 24 = 224 episodes
* To calculate the average number of episodes per year, we divide the total number of episodes (224) by the number of years (14):
    - 224 episodes / 14 years = 16 episodes per year

Answer: 16
