Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Chickens have 2 legs each
* Farmer Brown fed 7 chickens
* So the number of legs for the chickens is: 7 chickens x 2 legs per chicken = 14 legs
* Sheep have 4 legs each
* Farmer Brown fed 5 sheep
* So the number of legs for the sheep is: 5 sheep x 4 legs per sheep = 20 legs
* To find the total number of legs, we add the legs for the chickens and the legs for the sheep:
* 14 legs + 20 legs = 34 legs

Answer: 34
