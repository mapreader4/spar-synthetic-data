Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Camille saw 3 cardinals
* She saw four times as many robins as cardinals
* So the number of robins she saw is 4 x 3 = 12
* She saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals
* So the number of blue jays she saw is 2 x 3 = 6
* She saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals
* So the number of sparrows she saw is (3 x 3) + 1 = 10

Now, to find the total number of birds Camille saw, we add up all the birds:
* 3 cardinals + 12 robins + 6 blue jays + 10 sparrows = 31 birds

Answer: 31
