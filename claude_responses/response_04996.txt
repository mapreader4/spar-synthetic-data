Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rebecca drinks half a bottle of soda per day
* She bought 3 6-packs of sodas, which is 18 bottles total (3 x 6 = 18)
* We need to calculate how many bottles she will have left after 4 weeks
* In 4 weeks, there are 28 days (4 weeks x 7 days per week = 28 days)
* In 28 days, she will drink 14 bottles of soda (28 days x 0.5 bottles per day = 14 bottles)
* She started with 18 bottles, and will have 18 - 14 = 4 bottles left
