Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For the math test:
* The math test has 40 questions
* Phillip gets 75% of them right
* To calculate the number of questions he gets right on the math test:
* 75% of 40 = 0.75 * 40 = 30 questions

For the English test:
* The English test has 50 questions
* Phillip gets 98% of them right
* To calculate the number of questions he gets right on the English test:
* 98% of 50 = 0.98 * 50 = 49 questions

To calculate the total number of questions he gets right:
* Total questions right = questions right on math test + questions right on English test
* Total questions right = 30 + 49 = 79

Answer: 79
