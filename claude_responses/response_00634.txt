Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vaishali has 4 hats, each with 3 stripes
* So the total number of stripes on those 4 hats is: 4 hats x 3 stripes per hat = 12 stripes
* Vaishali also has 3 hats with 4 stripes each
* So the total number of stripes on those 3 hats is: 3 hats x 4 stripes per hat = 12 stripes
* Vaishali also has 6 hats with no stripes
* So the total number of stripes on those 6 hats is: 6 hats x 0 stripes per hat = 0 stripes
* Vaishali also has 2 hats with 5 stripes each
* So the total number of stripes on those 2 hats is: 2 hats x 5 stripes per hat = 10 stripes
* To get the combined total number of stripes, we add up all the stripes:
* 12 + 12 + 0 + 10 = 34 stripes

Answer: 34
