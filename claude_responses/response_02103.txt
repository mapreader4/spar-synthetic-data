Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The sandbox is square, with each side being 40 inches long.
2) The area of the sandbox is the length times the width, which is 40 inches x 40 inches = 1600 square inches.
3) A 30-pound bag of sand is enough to fill 80 square inches of the sandbox to an adequate depth.
4) To find how many pounds of sand are needed to fill the entire sandbox, we need to divide the total area of the sandbox (1600 square inches) by the area covered by 30 pounds of sand (80 square inches).
5) 1600 square inches / 80 square inches per 30 pounds = 20 bags of sand.
6) Since each bag is 30 pounds, the total amount of sand needed is 20 bags x 30 pounds per bag = 600 pounds.

Answer: 600
