Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Jerusha earned 4 times as much money as Lottie. This means that Jerusha's earnings can be represented as 4L, where L represents Lottie's earnings.
2) Together, Jerusha and Lottie earned $85. This means that Jerusha's earnings (4L) plus Lottie's earnings (L) must equal $85.
3) We can write this as an equation: 4L + L = 85
4) Simplifying, we get: 5L = 85
5) Dividing both sides by 5, we get: L = 17
6) Since Jerusha earned 4 times as much as Lottie, we can calculate Jerusha's earnings as: 4 * 17 = 68

Answer: 68
