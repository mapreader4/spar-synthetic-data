Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mortdecai collects 8 dozen eggs every Tuesday and Thursday, which is 16 dozen eggs per week.
* He delivers 3 dozen eggs to the market and 5 dozen eggs to the mall, which is 8 dozen eggs per week.
* He uses 4 dozen eggs to make a pie every Saturday.
* To find the number of eggs he donates to charity, we need to subtract the number of eggs he delivers and uses from the total number of eggs he collects.

Total eggs collected per week: 16 dozen = 192 eggs
Eggs delivered to market and mall: 8 dozen = 96 eggs
Eggs used to make pie: 4 dozen = 48 eggs

Eggs remaining to donate to charity:
192 eggs - 96 eggs - 48 eggs = 48 eggs

Answer: 48 eggs
