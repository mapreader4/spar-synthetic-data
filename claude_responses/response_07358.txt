Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack has been driving for the past 9 years
* He drives 37,000 miles every four months
* To find the total miles he has driven since he started driving, we need to calculate the number of four-month periods in 9 years and multiply that by the number of miles he drives in each four-month period.

First, let's calculate the number of four-month periods in 9 years:
* 9 years x 12 months/year = 108 months
* 108 months / 4 months per period = 27 four-month periods

Now, let's multiply the number of four-month periods by the number of miles he drives in each period:
* 27 four-month periods x 37,000 miles/period = 999,000 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles Jack has driven since he started driving is:

Answer: 999,000 miles
