Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The combined weight of the chihuahua, pitbull, and great dane is 439 pounds.
2) The pitbull weighs 3 times as much as the chihuahua.
3) The great dane weighs 10 more pounds than triple the pitbull.

Let's call the weight of the chihuahua 'x' pounds.
Then, the weight of the pitbull is 3x pounds.
And the weight of the great dane is 3(3x) + 10 = 9x + 10 pounds.

We know the combined weight is 439 pounds, so we can write the equation:
x + 3x + 9x + 10 = 439
13x + 10 = 439
13x = 429
x = 33

Therefore, the weight of the chihuahua is 33 pounds.
The weight of the pitbull is 3 * 33 = 99 pounds.
The weight of the great dane is 9 * 33 + 10 = 307 pounds.

Answer: 307 pounds.
