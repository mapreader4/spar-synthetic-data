Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Tuesday, Mike had 45 books.
2. Corey had twice as many books as Mike, so Corey had 45 x 2 = 90 books.
3. On Wednesday, Mike gave 10 books to Lily.
4. Corey gave Lily 15 more than Mike gave, so Corey gave Lily 10 + 15 = 25 books.
5. Therefore, the total number of books Lily got is the sum of the books Mike and Corey gave her, which is 10 + 25 = 35 books.

Answer: 35
