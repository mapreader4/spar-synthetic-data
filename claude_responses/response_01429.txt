Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ronald bought 200 phones for $3000 total.
2) He wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits.
3) To calculate the profit, we take one-third of the initial investment:
   - Initial investment: $3000
   - Profit: 1/3 * $3000 = $1000
4) The total selling price for all 200 phones should be the initial investment plus the profit:
   - Total selling price = $3000 + $1000 = $4000
5) To find the selling price per phone, we divide the total selling price by the number of phones:
   - Selling price per phone = $4000 / 200 = $20

Answer: $20
