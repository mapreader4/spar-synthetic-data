Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry charges $20 to pierce someone's nose
* He charges 50% more to pierce their ears
* 50% of $20 is $10, so he charges $30 to pierce someone's ears
* He pierces 6 noses, so for the nose piercings he makes:
    * 6 noses x $20 per nose = $120
* He pierces 9 ears, so for the ear piercings he makes:
    * 9 ears x $30 per ear = $270
* To calculate the total amount of money he makes, we add the nose piercings and ear piercings:
    * $120 + $270 = $390

Answer: $390
