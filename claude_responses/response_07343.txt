Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tamara made $32 from selling the brownies
* She made 2 pans of brownies
* Each pan of brownies was cut into 8 big square pieces
* To find the cost of each brownie, we need to divide the total amount made ($32) by the total number of brownies sold

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies sold:
* 2 pans of brownies, each cut into 8 pieces
* 2 pans x 8 pieces per pan = 16 total brownies sold

Now, we can divide the total amount made ($32) by the total number of brownies sold (16) to get the cost per brownie:
* $32 / 16 brownies = $2 per brownie

Answer: $2
