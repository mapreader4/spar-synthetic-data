Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The labor cost is $75 per hour.
2. The labor time required is 16 hours.
3. The labor cost is therefore $75 x 16 = $1,200.
4. The part itself costs $1,200.
5. To calculate the total cost, we add the labor cost and the part cost:
   $1,200 (labor) + $1,200 (part) = $2,400.

Answer: $2,400
