Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jon scored 3 points
* Jack scored 5 points more than Jon, so Jack scored 3 + 5 = 8 points
* Tom scored 4 less than the points of Jon and Jack together, so Tom scored (3 + 8) - 4 = 7 points

Now, to find the total points scored, we add up the points of Jon, Jack, and Tom:
* Total points = Jon's points + Jack's points + Tom's points
* Total points = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18

Answer: 18
