Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jo's current book has 210 pages
* She is currently at page 90
* An hour ago, she was at page 60
* So, in the last hour, she has read 90 - 60 = 30 pages
* At this rate, she is reading 30 pages per hour
* To find the total number of hours she will be reading the book, we need to divide the remaining pages (210 - 90 = 120 pages) by the number of pages she reads per hour (30 pages/hour)
* 120 pages / 30 pages/hour = 4 hours
