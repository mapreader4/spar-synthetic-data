Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob's original bill was $30
* Bob's discount is 5%, so his new bill is $30 - (5% of $30) = $30 - $1.50 = $28.50
* Kate's original bill was $25
* Kate's discount is 2%, so her new bill is $25 - (2% of $25) = $25 - $0.50 = $24.50
* To find the total amount they have to pay, we add Bob's new bill and Kate's new bill:
* $28.50 + $24.50 = $53.00
