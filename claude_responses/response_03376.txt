Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's original lifts:
   - Squat: 700 pounds
   - Bench: 400 pounds
   - Deadlift: 800 pounds

2. Squat:
   - John lost 30% of his squat lift
   - 30% of 700 pounds is 0.3 * 700 = 210 pounds
   - His new squat lift is 700 - 210 = 490 pounds

3. Bench:
   - John didn't lose any weight on bench, so his bench lift is still 400 pounds

4. Deadlift:
   - John lost 200 pounds on his deadlift
   - His new deadlift is 800 - 200 = 600 pounds

5. Calculating the new total:
   - New Squat: 490 pounds
   - New Bench: 400 pounds
   - New Deadlift: 600 pounds
   - New Total: 490 + 400 + 600 = 1490 pounds

Answer: 1490 pounds
