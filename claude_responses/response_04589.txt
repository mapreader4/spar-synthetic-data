Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The owner has to clean up 60 eggs
* Each egg takes 15 seconds to clean up
* So for 60 eggs, the time spent cleaning up the eggs is:
  * 60 eggs x 15 seconds per egg = 900 seconds
  * 900 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 15 minutes
* The owner also has to clean up 7 rolls of toilet paper
* Each roll of toilet paper takes 30 minutes to clean up
* So for 7 rolls, the time spent cleaning up the toilet paper is:
  * 7 rolls x 30 minutes per roll = 210 minutes
* To find the total time spent cleaning up, we add the time for the eggs and the time for the toilet paper:
  * 15 minutes + 210 minutes = 225 minutes

Answer: 225 minutes
