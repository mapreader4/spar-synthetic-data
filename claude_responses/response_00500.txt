Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joe caught the ball 23 times.
2) Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. So, Derek's catches = (2 x 23) - 4 = 42.
3) Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. A third of 42 is 14, and 16 more than that is 30.

Answer: 30
