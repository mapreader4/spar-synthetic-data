Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Aku invited 4 friends to his birthday party.
2) Aku's mother bought 3 packages of cookies, each containing 25 cookies.
3) The total number of cookies is 3 packages x 25 cookies per package = 75 cookies.
4) The 5 children (Aku and his 4 friends) will each eat an equal number of cookies.
5) To calculate the number of cookies each child will eat, we divide the total number of cookies (75) by the number of children (5).
6) 75 cookies / 5 children = 15 cookies per child.
