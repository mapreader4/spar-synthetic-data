Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mona brought 20 cookies to share in class.
2) Jasmine brought 5 fewer cookies than Mona. So, if Mona brought 20 cookies, Jasmine brought 20 - 5 = 15 cookies.
3) Rachel brought 10 more cookies than Jasmine. So, if Jasmine brought 15 cookies, Rachel brought 15 + 10 = 25 cookies.
4) To find the total number of cookies brought by Mona, Jasmine, and Rachel, we add up their individual amounts:
Mona: 20 cookies
Jasmine: 15 cookies
Rachel: 25 cookies
Total: 20 + 15 + 25 = 60 cookies

Answer: 60
