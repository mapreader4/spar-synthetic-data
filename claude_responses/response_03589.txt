Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Danny has two sails: a 24 square foot sail and a 12 square foot sail
* With the 24 square foot sail, he travels at 50 MPH
* With the 12 square foot sail, he travels at 20 MPH
* He plans to travel 200 miles

To calculate the time it takes to travel 200 miles with each sail:
* With the 24 square foot sail:
  * Time = Distance / Speed
  * Time = 200 miles / 50 MPH
  * Time = 4 hours
* With the 12 square foot sail:
  * Time = Distance / Speed
  * Time = 200 miles / 20 MPH
  * Time = 10 hours

Now, to calculate the difference in time:
* Time difference = Time with 12 square foot sail - Time with 24 square foot sail
* Time difference = 10 hours - 4 hours
* Time difference = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
