Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joan wants to travel 480 miles
* She drives at a rate of 60 mph
* She takes a 30-minute lunch break
* She takes two 15-minute bathroom breaks

First, let's calculate the time it takes to drive the 480 miles at 60 mph:
* Time to drive = Distance / Speed
* Time to drive = 480 miles / 60 mph
* Time to drive = 8 hours

Now, let's add the time for the breaks:
* Lunch break: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
* Bathroom breaks: 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
* Total break time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour

Finally, we add the driving time and the break time:
* Total time = Driving time + Break time
* Total time = 8 hours + 1 hour
* Total time = 9 hours

Answer: 9 hours
