Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The total number of lions in the park is 200.
2. The number of leopards is half the number of lions, so the number of leopards is 200 / 2 = 100.
3. The number of elephants is half the combined number of lions and leopards, so the number of elephants is (200 + 100) / 2 = 150.
4. The total population of the three animals in the park is the sum of the number of lions, leopards, and elephants.
5. The total population is 200 + 100 + 150 = 450.

Answer: 450
