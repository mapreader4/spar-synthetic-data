Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John drives 1000 miles a month
* He needs an oil change every 3000 miles
* He gets 1 free oil change a year
* An oil change costs $50

To calculate how much he pays a year, we need to determine how many oil changes he needs to pay for in a year.

* In a year, John drives 1000 miles x 12 months = 12,000 miles
* He needs an oil change every 3000 miles
* 12,000 miles / 3,000 miles per oil change = 4 oil changes needed per year
* He gets 1 free oil change a year, so he needs to pay for 3 oil changes

Now we can calculate the total cost:
* 3 oil changes x $50 per oil change = $150

Answer: $150
