Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, the total number of positive Coronavirus cases was recorded as 2000.

2. On the second day, the number of cases increased by 500, so the total number of cases is now 2000 + 500 = 2500.
   However, there were also 50 recoveries, so the net increase is 500 - 50 = 450.
   Therefore, the total number of positive cases on the second day is 2000 + 450 = 2450.

3. On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500, so the total number of cases is now 2450 + 1500 = 3950.
   However, there were also 200 recoveries, so the net increase is 1500 - 200 = 1300.
   Therefore, the total number of positive cases on the third day is 2450 + 1300 = 3750.

Answer: 3750
