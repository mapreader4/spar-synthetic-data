Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Luke's mother gave him:
   - 1 x $50 bill = $50
   - 2 x $20 bills = $40
   - 3 x $10 bills = $30
   - Total from mother = $50 + $40 + $30 = $120

2. Luke's father gave him:
   - 4 x $50 bills = $200
   - 1 x $20 bill = $20
   - 1 x $10 bill = $10
   - Total from father = $200 + $20 + $10 = $230

3. The total amount Luke received from his parents is:
   - Total from mother + Total from father = $120 + $230 = $350

4. Since the parents gave him the exact amount for the school fee, the school fee must be $350.

Answer: $350
