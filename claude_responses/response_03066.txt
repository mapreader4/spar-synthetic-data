Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Martin initially had some number of fruits, which we will call x.
2) He ate half of the fruits, so he ate x/2 fruits.
3) After eating half the fruits, he remained with twice as many oranges as limes.
4) We know that he has 50 oranges now, so let's call the number of limes y.
5) Since he has twice as many oranges as limes, we can say that 50 = 2y.
6) Solving for y, we get y = 25.
7) So he has 25 limes and 50 oranges, for a total of 75 fruits remaining.
8) Since he ate half the fruits, the initial number of fruits must have been 2 * 75 = 150.

Answer: 150
