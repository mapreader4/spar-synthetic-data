Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You originally bought 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants for a total of $120
* Let's call the price of a shirt 'x' and the price of a pants 'y'
* So the original purchase was: 2x + 3y = $120
* You then returned the 3 pairs of pants and received a 25% refund
* The refund amount would be 0.25 * 3y = 0.75y
* So the final amount you paid is $120 - 0.75y
* We know that the final amount paid is for the 2 shirts, so 2x = $120 - 0.75y
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = ($120 - 0.75y) / 2
* Therefore, the price of 1 shirt is:
Answer: $60
