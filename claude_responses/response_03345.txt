Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Rica's group won a dance competition and she got 3/8 of the prize money.
2) Rica spent 1/5 of her prize money, and is now left with $300.
3) Let's call the total prize money that Rica's group won as "x".
4) Rica's share of the prize money is 3/8 of x, which we can represent as 3/8 * x.
5) Rica spent 1/5 of her prize money, which means she had 4/5 of her prize money left.
6) The amount Rica has left is $300, which is 4/5 of her original prize money.
7) So, 4/5 * (3/8 * x) = $300
8) Solving for x, we get:
(4/5) * (3/8) * x = $300
(12/40) * x = $300
x = $1000

Answer: $1000
