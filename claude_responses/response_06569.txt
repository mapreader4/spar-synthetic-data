Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The price per person for the trip to Egypt is $147.
* Ali and Leila each received a discount of $14 since they are traveling together.
* To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to:
  1. Calculate the total price without any discounts:
     * 2 people x $147 per person = $294
  2. Calculate the total discount:
     * 2 people x $14 discount per person = $28
  3. Subtract the total discount from the total price:
     * $294 - $28 = $266

Answer: $266
