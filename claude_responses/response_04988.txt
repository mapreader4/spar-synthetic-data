Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Greg initially lent Tessa $40.
2) A week later, Tessa paid him back half of her debt. That means she paid back $20.
3) A few days later, Tessa asked him for $10 more.

To calculate how much Tessa still owes Greg, we need to:
1) Start with the initial debt of $40.
2) Subtract the $20 that Tessa paid back.
3) Add the additional $10 that Tessa borrowed.

So the calculation is:
$40 - $20 + $10 = $30

Answer: 30
