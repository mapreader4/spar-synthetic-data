Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chuck has 3 pregnant dogs
* Each dog gives birth to 4 puppies
* So the total number of puppies born is 3 dogs x 4 puppies per dog = 12 puppies
* Each puppy needs 2 shots
* So the total number of shots needed is 12 puppies x 2 shots per puppy = 24 shots
* Each shot costs $5
* So the total cost of the shots is 24 shots x $5 per shot = $120

Answer: $120
