Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Toby wants to have 500 calories for breakfast
* A piece of bread has 100 calories
* A serving of peanut butter has 200 calories
* Toby has one piece of bread

To find the number of servings of peanut butter he should add, we need to calculate the remaining calories needed after accounting for the one piece of bread.

The calories from the one piece of bread is 100 calories.
The remaining calories needed is 500 calories - 100 calories = 400 calories.

Since each serving of peanut butter has 200 calories, we need to divide the remaining calories needed by 200 to find the number of servings of peanut butter.

400 calories / 200 calories per serving = 2 servings of peanut butter.
