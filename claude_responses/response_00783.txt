Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The zoo has 8 parrots
* The number of snakes is 3 times the number of parrots, so the number of snakes is 3 * 8 = 24
* The number of monkeys is 2 times the number of snakes, so the number of monkeys is 2 * 24 = 48
* The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, so the number of elephants is (8 + 24) / 2 = 16
* The number of zebras is 3 fewer than the number of elephants, so the number of zebras is 16 - 3 = 13

Now, to find the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys:
* Number of monkeys: 48
* Number of zebras: 13
* Difference: 48 - 13 = 35

Answer: 35
