Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, Martha had 4 bottles of juice in the refrigerator and 4 bottles in the pantry, so a total of 8 bottles.
* During the week, Martha bought 5 more bottles of juice.
* So the total number of bottles Martha had after buying the 5 additional bottles is 8 + 5 = 13 bottles.
* Martha and her family drank 3 bottles of juice during the week.
* Therefore, the number of bottles left is 13 - 3 = 10 bottles.
