Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 10 packs of magic cards
* Each pack has 20 cards
* 1/4 of the cards in each pack are uncommon

First, let's calculate the total number of cards John bought:
* 10 packs x 20 cards per pack = 200 cards

Now, we need to calculate how many of those cards are uncommon. Since 1/4 of the cards in each pack are uncommon, we can calculate the number of uncommon cards per pack:
* 1/4 of 20 cards = 5 uncommon cards per pack

Finally, we can calculate the total number of uncommon cards John got:
* 10 packs x 5 uncommon cards per pack = 50 uncommon cards

Answer: 50
