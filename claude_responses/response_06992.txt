Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tiffany has $3 to play the ring toss game
* Each play costs $1 and she gets 5 rings per play
* For every red bucket she tosses a ring into, she gets 2 points
* For every green bucket she tosses a ring into, she gets 3 points
* She has already played 2 games and gotten 4 red buckets and 5 green buckets
* We need to find the maximum total points she can get for all 3 games

First, let's calculate the points she has already earned:
* 4 red buckets x 2 points = 8 points
* 5 green buckets x 3 points = 15 points
* Total points already earned = 8 + 15 = 23 points

Now, let's calculate how many more plays she can make with her remaining $2:
* 2 plays at $1 each = 2 plays

In each of these 2 plays, she can get a maximum of 5 points per play (if she gets all green buckets).
* 2 plays x 5 points per play = 10 more points

Therefore, the maximum total points she can get for all 3 games is:
* 23 points (from the first 2 games) + 10 points (from the last game) = 33 points

Answer: 33
