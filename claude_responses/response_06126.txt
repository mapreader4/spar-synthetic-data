Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Paul makes 100 pencils a day, 5 days a week
* So, in a week, he makes 100 pencils x 5 days = 500 pencils
* He started the week with 80 pencils in his stock
* During the week, he sold 350 pencils
* To calculate the number of pencils he had in his stock at the end of the week, we need to:
   - Start with the initial stock of 80 pencils
   - Add the 500 pencils he made during the week
   - Subtract the 350 pencils he sold during the week
* 80 + 500 - 350 = 230 pencils

Answer: 230
