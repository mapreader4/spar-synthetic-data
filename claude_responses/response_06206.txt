Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The computer table costs $140, and Frank agreed to pay for this.
2. The computer chair costs $100, and Eman agreed to pay for this.
3. The joystick costs $20, and Frank agreed to pay 1/4 of the price, which is $5. The remaining $15 will be paid by Eman.

Now, let's calculate the total amount that Frank and Eman will spend:

Frank's total:
* Computer table: $140
* 1/4 of the joystick: $5
* Total: $140 + $5 = $145

Eman's total:
* Computer chair: $100
* 3/4 of the joystick: $15
* Total: $100 + $15 = $115

The difference between what Frank and Eman will spend is:
* Frank's total - Eman's total = $145 - $115 = $30

Answer: $30
