Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 primary schools in the town
* 2 of the schools can teach 400 students at a time
* The other 2 schools can teach 340 students at a time
* To find the total number of students that can be taught at a time, we need to add the capacities of the 4 schools.

For the 2 schools that can teach 400 students at a time:
* 2 schools x 400 students per school = 800 students

For the 2 schools that can teach 340 students at a time:
* 2 schools x 340 students per school = 680 students

Now we add the two totals together:
* 800 students + 680 students = 1,480 students

Therefore, the total number of students that can be taught at a time in these 4 primary schools is:

Answer: 1,480
