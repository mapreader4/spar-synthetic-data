Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The mayor commissioned two artists, Celina and Diego, to paint 50 murals around the city.
* Once the work was completed, Celina was paid $1,000 more than 4 times the amount Diego got.
* The mayor paid the two artists a total of $50,000.

Let's define the variables:
* Let x be the amount Diego got paid.
* Then Celina got paid 4x + $1,000.

We know that the total amount paid to the two artists is $50,000, so we can set up an equation:
* x + (4x + $1,000) = $50,000

Solving for x:
* 5x + $1,000 = $50,000
* 5x = $49,000
* x = $9,800

Therefore, Diego got paid $9,800.

Answer: 9800
