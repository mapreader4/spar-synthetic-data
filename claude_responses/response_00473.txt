Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that James and Ali together own $250.
2) We also know that James owns $40 more than Ali.
3) Let's represent Ali's amount as x.
4) Since James owns $40 more than Ali, James' amount can be represented as x + 40.
5) The total amount owned by James and Ali is $250, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 40) = 250
6) Simplifying the equation:
2x + 40 = 250
7) Subtracting 40 from both sides:
2x = 210
8) Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 105
9) Since Ali's amount is x, which is $105, and James owns $40 more than Ali, James' amount is $105 + $40 = $145.

Answer: 145
