Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total duration of the trip is 8 hours
* The first half of the trip is 4 hours (half of 8 hours)
* During the first half, Martin traveled at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour
* So, in the first half of the trip, Martin traveled 70 kilometers per hour x 4 hours = 280 kilometers
* The second half of the trip is also 4 hours
* During the second half, Martin traveled at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour
* So, in the second half of the trip, Martin traveled 85 kilometers per hour x 4 hours = 340 kilometers
* To get the total distance traveled, we add the distances from the first half and second half:
* 280 kilometers + 340 kilometers = 620 kilometers

Answer: 620
