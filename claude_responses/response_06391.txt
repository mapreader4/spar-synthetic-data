Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) The puzzle has a total of 500 pieces.
2) The border of the puzzle is 75 pieces.
3) Trevor was able to place 105 pieces of the puzzle.
4) Joe was able to place three times the number of puzzle pieces as Trevor, which means Joe placed 3 x 105 = 315 pieces.
5) The total number of pieces placed by Trevor and Joe is 105 + 315 = 420 pieces.
6) The number of puzzle pieces missing is the total number of pieces (500) minus the number of pieces placed (420).
