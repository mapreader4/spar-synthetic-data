Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The first team consists of Beth and Jan.
2) Beth scored 12 points and Jan scored 10 points.
3) The total points scored by the first team is 12 + 10 = 22 points.
4) The second team consists of Judy and Angel.
5) Judy scored 8 points and Angel scored 11 points.
6) The total points scored by the second team is 8 + 11 = 19 points.
7) To find the difference in points between the first team and the second team, we subtract the second team's points from the first team's points:
22 points - 19 points = 3 points.
