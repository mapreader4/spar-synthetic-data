Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Steve initially has 200 fish in stock.
2) He sells 50 fish, so he now has 200 - 50 = 150 fish remaining.
3) A third of the remaining fish become spoiled. A third of 150 is 50, so 50 fish become spoiled. He now has 150 - 50 = 100 fish remaining.
4) A new stock of 200 more fish arrives, so he now has 100 + 200 = 300 fish in stock.

Answer: 300
