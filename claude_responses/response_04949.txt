Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Françoise buys the pots of lily of the valley at €12 each.
2) She sells them at a 25% higher cost. This means she sells them for €12 + (0.25 * €12) = €15 each.
3) She sells 150 pots of lily of the valley.
4) To calculate the total amount she will give back to the association, we need to multiply the selling price per pot (€15) by the number of pots sold (150).
5) €15 * 150 = €2,250.

Answer: 2250
