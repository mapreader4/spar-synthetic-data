Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Antonov bought 60 candies
* He gave a pack of candy to his sister
* Each pack of candy has 20 pieces

To find out how many packs Antonov still has, we need to:
1. Calculate how many candies were in the pack he gave to his sister
2. Subtract that number from the total number of candies he bought

Step 1: Each pack has 20 pieces, so the pack he gave to his sister had 20 candies.

Step 2: Antonov bought 60 candies, and he gave away 20 of them. 
So the number of candies he still has is 60 - 20 = 40 candies.

Now we need to calculate how many packs that is.
Since each pack has 20 pieces, we divide the remaining 40 candies by 20 to get the number of packs.

40 candies / 20 candies per pack = 2 packs
