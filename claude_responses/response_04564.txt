Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Fiona and Casey share the hoodies they own, so the total number of hoodies they own is 8.
2) Casey owns 2 more hoodies than Fiona.
3) Let's represent the number of hoodies Fiona owns as x.
4) Then, the number of hoodies Casey owns is x + 2.
5) The total number of hoodies they own is 8, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 2) = 8
6) Simplifying the equation:
2x + 2 = 8
7) Subtracting 2 from both sides:
2x = 6
8) Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 3
