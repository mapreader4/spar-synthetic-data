Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jaden started with 14 toy cars
* He then bought 28 more cars from the toy store
* He then got 12 more cars for his birthday
* So the total number of cars Jaden had after these additions is:
    - 14 + 28 + 12 = 54 cars
* He then gave 8 cars to his sister and 3 cars to his friend Vinnie
* So the total number of cars he gave away is:
    - 8 + 3 = 11 cars
* To find the number of cars Jaden has left, we take the total number of cars he had (54) and subtract the number of cars he gave away (11):
    - 54 - 11 = 43 cars

Answer: 43
