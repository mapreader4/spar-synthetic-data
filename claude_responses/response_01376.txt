Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bronson collects 12 leaves on Thursday and 13 leaves on Friday, for a total of 12 + 13 = 25 leaves.
2) 20% of the leaves are brown and 20% are green. This means that 60% of the leaves are yellow.
3) 20% of 25 leaves is 0.2 * 25 = 5 brown leaves.
4) 20% of 25 leaves is 0.2 * 25 = 5 green leaves.
5) The remaining 60% of 25 leaves is 0.6 * 25 = 15 yellow leaves.
