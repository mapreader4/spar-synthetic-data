Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Carla will be 30 years old in 6 years, so her current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years old.
2) The sum of the current ages of Carla and Louis is 55.
3) We know Carla's current age is 24, so we can subtract that from 55 to get Louis' current age:
55 - 24 = 31
Answer: 31
