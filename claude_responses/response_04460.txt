Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. James buys a weight vest for $250.
2. He then buys 200 pounds of weight plates for $1.2 per pound.
   * Cost of weight plates = 200 pounds x $1.2 per pound = $240
3. A 200-pound weight vest would cost $700, but there is a $100 discount.
   * Cost of 200-pound weight vest = $700 - $100 = $600
4. To calculate the amount James saves with his vest:
   * Cost of James' vest = $250 + $240 = $490
   * Cost of 200-pound weight vest = $600
   * Amount saved = $600 - $490 = $110

Answer: $110
