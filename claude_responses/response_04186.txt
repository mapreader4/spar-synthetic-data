Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys game loot boxes for $5 each.
2) The average value of items inside is $3.5.
3) He spends $40 on loot boxes.
4) To calculate the average amount he lost, we need to find the difference between what he spent and the average value of the items he received.
5) He spent $40 on loot boxes.
6) Since each loot box costs $5, he bought 8 loot boxes ($40 / $5 = 8).
7) The average value of the items inside the 8 loot boxes is 8 * $3.5 = $28.
8) The average amount he lost is the difference between what he spent and the average value of the items he received: $40 - $28 = $12.

Answer: $12
