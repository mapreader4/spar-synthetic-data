Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago
* Let's call John's current age "x"
* 9 years from now, John's age will be x + 9
* 11 years ago, John's age was x - 11
* The problem statement says that x + 9 = 3(x - 11)
* Solving this equation:
    * x + 9 = 3x - 33
    * -2x = -42
    * x = 21
Therefore, John is currently 21 years old.

Answer: 21
