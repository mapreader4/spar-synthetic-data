Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob ordered 80 packs of Greek yogurt
* 40% of the packs were expired
* To calculate the number of expired packs:
    - 40% of 80 = 0.4 * 80 = 32 expired packs
* Each pack cost $12
* To calculate the refund amount:
    - 32 expired packs * $12 per pack = $384

Answer: $384
