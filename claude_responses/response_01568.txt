Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sasha made 30 chocolate muffins
* Melissa made 4 times as many muffins as Sasha, so Melissa made 4 x 30 = 120 muffins
* Tiffany made half of Sasha and Melissa's total number of muffins, so the total number of muffins made by Sasha and Melissa is 30 + 120 = 150, and Tiffany made half of that, which is 150 / 2 = 75 muffins
* So the total number of muffins made is 30 + 120 + 75 = 225 muffins
* Each muffin sold for $4
* To calculate the total money contributed to the fundraiser, we multiply the total number of muffins (225) by the price per muffin ($4)
* 225 muffins x $4 per muffin = $900

Answer: $900
