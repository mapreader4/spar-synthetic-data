Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Porter earns $8 per day
* He works 5 times a week
* His manager is asking him to work an extra day per week
* The extra day will pay an extra 50% on top of his daily rate

First, let's calculate his normal weekly earnings:
* 5 days per week x $8 per day = $40 per week

Now, let's calculate the extra earnings from the overtime day:
* 1 extra day per week x $8 per day x 1.5 (50% extra) = $12 per week

So, his total weekly earnings with the overtime day would be:
* $40 + $12 = $52 per week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for a month (4 weeks):
* $52 per week x 4 weeks = $208 per month

Answer: $208
