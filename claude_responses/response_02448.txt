Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 10 boxes, each containing 50 bottles of water.
2) Each bottle has a capacity of 12 liters.
3) Each bottle is filled up to 3/4 of its capacity.
4) To calculate the amount of water in each bottle:
   - Bottle capacity: 12 liters
   - Filled to 3/4 capacity: 12 * 3/4 = 9 liters per bottle
5) To calculate the total amount of water in all the bottles:
   - 10 boxes x 50 bottles per box = 500 bottles
   - 500 bottles x 9 liters per bottle = 4,500 liters

Answer: 4,500 liters
