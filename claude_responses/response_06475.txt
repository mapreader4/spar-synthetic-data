Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We are given that three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60.
2) We are also given that Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, and Atticus has 4 marbles.
3) Since Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, we can say that Jensen has 8 marbles (2 times Atticus' 4 marbles).
4) Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of marbles Cruz has:
3 * (Atticus' marbles + Jensen's marbles + Cruz's marbles) = 60
3 * (4 + 8 + Cruz's marbles) = 60
3 * (12 + Cruz's marbles) = 60
36 + 3 * Cruz's marbles = 60
3 * Cruz's marbles = 24
Cruz's marbles = 8

Answer: 8
