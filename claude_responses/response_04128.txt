Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sonia and Joss spend 15 minutes filling the car with their stuff
* They then spend 30 minutes driving from the previous house to the new house
* They do not waste any time unloading the car
* They make a total of 6 trips to complete the move

To calculate the total time spent moving, we need to add up the time for each trip:
* 15 minutes filling the car + 30 minutes driving = 45 minutes per trip
* 45 minutes per trip x 6 trips = 270 minutes total

Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:
* 270 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4.5 hours

Answer: 4 hours
