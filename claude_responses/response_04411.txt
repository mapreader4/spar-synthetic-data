Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexis can sew 1 skirt in 2 hours
* Alexis can sew 1 coat in 7 hours
* We need to find how long it takes Alexis to sew 6 skirts and 4 coats

To find the time for the 6 skirts:
* 6 skirts x 2 hours per skirt = 12 hours

To find the time for the 4 coats:
* 4 coats x 7 hours per coat = 28 hours

To find the total time:
* 12 hours (for the skirts) + 28 hours (for the coats) = 40 hours

Answer: 40 hours
