Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The cost of the burgers:
   * 100 pounds of burgers at $3 per pound
   * Total cost of burgers = 100 pounds x $3 per pound = $300

2. The cost of the condiments and propane:
   * $80

3. The cost of the alcohol:
   * $200

4. The total cost of the block party:
   * Cost of burgers + Cost of condiments and propane + Cost of alcohol
   * $300 + $80 + $200 = $580

5. Since John is splitting the cost with 3 other people, John's total contribution is:
   * $580 / 4 = $145

Answer: $145
