Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The cost of the house is $480,000 and the cost of the trailer is $120,000.
2) Both loans will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years.
3) To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula: Monthly Payment = Loan Amount / (Number of Payments)
4) For the house:
   - Loan Amount = $480,000
   - Number of Payments = 20 years x 12 months/year = 240 payments
   - Monthly Payment = $480,000 / 240 = $2,000
5) For the trailer:
   - Loan Amount = $120,000
   - Number of Payments = 20 years x 12 months/year = 240 payments
   - Monthly Payment = $120,000 / 240 = $500
6) The difference in monthly payments between the house and the trailer is:
   - $2,000 - $500 = $1,500
Answer: $1,500
