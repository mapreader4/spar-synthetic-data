Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sasha heard that for each tree planted, the temperature drops by 0.1 degrees
* The temperature dropped from 80 to 78.2 degrees
* To calculate the temperature drop, we subtract the final temperature from the initial temperature: 80 - 78.2 = 1.8 degrees
* Since each tree planted causes a 0.1 degree drop, we can divide the total temperature drop by 0.1 to find the number of trees planted:
1.8 degrees / 0.1 degrees per tree = 18 trees
* Each tree costs $6 to plant
* To find the total cost, we multiply the number of trees by the cost per tree:
18 trees x $6 per tree = $108

Answer: $108
