Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The standard price for a pizza is $5
* For the triple cheese pizzas, there is a buy-1-get-1-free special
* For the meat lovers pizzas, there is a buy-2-get-1-free special
* We need to purchase 10 triple cheese pizzas and 9 meat lovers pizzas

For the triple cheese pizzas:
* With the buy-1-get-1-free special, we get 10 pizzas for the price of 5
* 5 pizzas at $5 each is $25

For the meat lovers pizzas:
* With the buy-2-get-1-free special, we get 9 pizzas for the price of 6
* 6 pizzas at $5 each is $30

Now, we add the cost of the two types of pizzas:
* $25 + $30 = $55

Answer: $55
