Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael brought a 5,000 pack of rubber bands to class
* He has already made 22 small balls
* Each small ball uses 50 rubber bands
* So the number of rubber bands used for the 22 small balls is:
    - 22 small balls x 50 rubber bands per small ball = 1,100 rubber bands
* Now, we need to find out how many rubber bands are left for the large balls
    - Total rubber bands = 5,000
    - Rubber bands used for small balls = 1,100
    - Remaining rubber bands = 5,000 - 1,100 = 3,900
* Each large ball requires 300 rubber bands
* So the number of large balls he can make with the remaining 3,900 rubber bands is:
    - 3,900 rubber bands / 300 rubber bands per large ball = 13 large balls
