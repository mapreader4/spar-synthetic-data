Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Harry needs to buy 5 spellbooks, each costing 5 gold.
   * Total cost of spellbooks = 5 books x 5 gold per book = 25 gold

2. Harry needs to buy 3 potion kits, each costing 20 silver.
   * Total cost of potion kits = 3 kits x 20 silver per kit = 60 silver

3. Harry needs to buy 1 owl that costs 28 gold.
   * Total cost of the owl = 28 gold

4. We know that there are 9 silver to a gold.
   * So, 25 gold + 28 gold = 53 gold
   * 53 gold x 9 silver per gold = 477 silver
   * 477 silver + 60 silver = 537 silver

Answer: 537
