Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jake sold 10 more stuffed animals than Thor.
2) Quincy sold ten times as many stuffed animals as Thor.
3) Quincy sold 200 stuffed animals.
4) Since Quincy sold ten times as many as Thor, we can divide 200 by 10 to find that Thor sold 20 stuffed animals.
5) Since Jake sold 10 more than Thor, Jake sold 20 + 10 = 30 stuffed animals.
6) Quincy sold 200 stuffed animals, and Jake sold 30 stuffed animals.
7) Therefore, Quincy sold 200 - 30 = 170 more stuffed animals than Jake.
