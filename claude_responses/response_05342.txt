Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nick hides 10 chocolates in his closet.
2) Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates as Nick. So, Alix hides 3 x 10 = 30 chocolates.
3) Last night, their mom found and took 5 chocolates from Alix.
4) So, Alix now has 30 - 5 = 25 chocolates.
5) The question asks how many more chocolates Alix has than Nick.
6) Nick has 10 chocolates, and Alix has 25 chocolates.
7) Therefore, Alix has 25 - 10 = 15 more chocolates than Nick.

Answer: 15
