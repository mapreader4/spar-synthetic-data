Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Raine buys:
  - 3 bracelets at $15 each, so 3 x $15 = $45
  - 2 gold heart necklaces at $10 each, so 2 x $10 = $20
  - 1 coffee mug at $20
* So the total cost of Raine's purchases is:
  - $45 + $20 + $20 = $85
* Raine pays with a $100 bill
* To calculate the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
  - $100 - $85 = $15

Answer: 15
