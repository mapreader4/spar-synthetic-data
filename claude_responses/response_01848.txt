Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, they sold 12 bouquets.
2. On Tuesday, they sold three times as many bouquets as they did on Monday. So, on Tuesday they sold 12 x 3 = 36 bouquets.
3. On Wednesday, they sold a third of what they sold on Tuesday. So, on Wednesday they sold 36 / 3 = 12 bouquets.

Now, to calculate the total number of bouquets sold during the three-day sale, we add up the sales from each day:
12 + 36 + 12 = 60 bouquets

Answer: 60
