Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On day one, Mabel counted 15 fish
* Of those 15 fish, 25% are sharks and 75% are another type of fish
* To find the number of sharks on day one, we take 25% of 15:
* 25% of 15 = 0.25 * 15 = 3.75 sharks
* Since we can't have a fractional number of sharks, we round down to 3 sharks on day one
* On day two, Mabel counted three times as many fish as on day one, which is 3 * 15 = 45 fish
* Again, 25% of those 45 fish are sharks, so the number of sharks on day two is:
* 25% of 45 = 0.25 * 45 = 11.25 sharks
* Rounding down, that's 11 sharks on day two
* To find the total number of sharks counted over the two days, we add the sharks from each day:
* 3 sharks on day one + 11 sharks on day two = 14 sharks
