Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The x-ray costs $250.
2) The MRI costs triple the cost of the x-ray, which is $250 x 3 = $750.
3) The total cost of the x-ray and MRI is $250 + $750 = $1,000.
4) Insurance covers 80% of the total cost, which is 0.8 x $1,000 = $800.
5) The remaining amount that Mike has to pay is the total cost minus the insurance coverage, which is $1,000 - $800 = $200.

Answer: $200
