Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. James has 2 trees.
2. Each tree has 20 plants.
3. Each plant has 1 seed.
4. James plants 60% of the total seeds.

To calculate the total number of seeds:
* 2 trees x 20 plants per tree = 40 plants total
* 40 plants x 1 seed per plant = 40 seeds total

Now, to calculate the number of seeds James planted:
* 40 seeds total x 60% = 24 seeds planted

Since each seed will grow into a new tree, the answer is:
Answer: 24
