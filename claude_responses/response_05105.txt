Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each pine tree makes 80 logs
* Jerry cuts up 8 pine trees
* So, the number of logs from the pine trees is 8 * 80 = 640 logs

* Each maple tree makes 60 logs
* Jerry cuts up 3 maple trees
* So, the number of logs from the maple trees is 3 * 60 = 180 logs

* Each walnut tree makes 100 logs
* Jerry cuts up 4 walnut trees
* So, the number of logs from the walnut trees is 4 * 100 = 400 logs

Now, to find the total number of logs, we add up the logs from each type of tree:
* Total logs = 640 + 180 + 400 = 1220 logs

Answer: 1220
