Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The original price of the slippers is $50.00.
2. The slippers are currently 10% off, which means the discounted price is 90% of the original price.
   * Discounted price = $50.00 x 0.90 = $45.00
3. The embroidery cost is $5.50 per shoe, so for a pair of slippers, the embroidery cost is $5.50 x 2 = $11.00.
4. The shipping cost is a flat rate of $10.00.

To calculate the total cost, we add up the discounted price of the slippers, the embroidery cost, and the shipping cost:
* Total cost = Discounted price of slippers + Embroidery cost + Shipping cost
* Total cost = $45.00 + $11.00 + $10.00 = $66.00

Answer: $66
