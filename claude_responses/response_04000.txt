Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jenny's bottle cap:
   - It flies 18 feet straight.
   - Then it bounces off a street light and flies another 1/3 of the distance it already went.
   - So, the total distance Jenny's bottle cap flew is:
     - 18 feet + (1/3 * 18 feet) = 18 feet + 6 feet = 24 feet.

2. Mark's bottle cap:
   - It flies 15 feet forward.
   - Then it bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did.
   - So, the total distance Mark's bottle cap flew is:
     - 15 feet + (2 * 15 feet) = 15 feet + 30 feet = 45 feet.

3. Comparing the distances:
   - Mark's bottle cap went 45 feet, while Jenny's bottle cap went 24 feet.
   - Therefore, Mark's bottle cap went 45 feet - 24 feet = 21 feet further than Jenny's.
