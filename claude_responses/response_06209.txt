Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* At the beginning of spring, Gilbert planted:
    - 3 basil bushes
    - 1 parsley plant
    - 2 kinds of mint (let's assume 2 mint plants)
* So, the total number of plants at the beginning of spring was:
    - 3 basil + 1 parsley + 2 mint = 6 plants
* Halfway through spring, one of the basil plants dropped seeds and grew an extra basil plant.
    - So now there are 4 basil plants
* Near the end of spring, a rabbit ate all the mint plants.
    - So now there are 4 basil plants and 1 parsley plant.
