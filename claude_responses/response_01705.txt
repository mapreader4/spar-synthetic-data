Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maria wants to buy 3 dozens of flowers
* For every 1 dozen flowers bought, the customer gets 2 free flowers
* So, for 3 dozens of flowers, Maria will get:
    - 3 dozens x 12 flowers per dozen = 36 flowers
    - 3 dozens x 2 free flowers per dozen = 6 free flowers
* Therefore, the total number of flowers Maria will have is:
    - 36 flowers (from the 3 dozens purchased)
    - 6 free flowers
    - Total = 36 + 6 = 42 flowers

Answer: 42
