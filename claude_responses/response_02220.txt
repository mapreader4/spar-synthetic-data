Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Luke takes a 70-minute bus to work every day.
2. Paula takes 3/5 of the time Luke takes to arrive by bus at work.
   * 3/5 of 70 minutes = 42 minutes
3. Luke takes a bike ride back home every day, which is 5 times slower than the bus.
   * Bike ride time = 70 minutes x 5 = 350 minutes
4. Paula takes the bus back home, which takes the same time as her trip to work, which is 42 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of time they take traveling from home to work and back each day:

Luke's total time:
* To work: 70 minutes
* Back home: 350 minutes
* Total: 70 + 350 = 420 minutes

Paula's total time:
* To work: 42 minutes
* Back home: 42 minutes
* Total: 42 + 42 = 84 minutes

Total time for both Luke and Paula:
* 420 minutes + 84 minutes = 504 minutes

Answer: 504 minutes
