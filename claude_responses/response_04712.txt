Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony walks 3 miles carrying a 25-pound backpack
* He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour
* So the time it takes him to walk 3 miles is:
    * 3 miles / 3 miles per hour = 1 hour
* Then he runs another 10 miles without the backpack
* He runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour
* So the time it takes him to run 10 miles is:
    * 10 miles / 5 miles per hour = 2 hours
* Therefore, the total time he spends exercising each morning is:
    * 1 hour (walking) + 2 hours (running) = 3 hours

Now, we need to calculate how many hours he spends exercising per week.
* He exercises every morning
* There are 7 days in a week
* So the total time he spends exercising per week is:
    * 3 hours per day x 7 days per week = 21 hours

Answer: 21 hours
