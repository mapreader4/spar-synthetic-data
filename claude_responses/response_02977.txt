Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cindy can jump rope for 12 minutes before tripping up
* Betsy can jump rope half as long as Cindy before tripping up
* Betsy's jump rope time = 12 minutes / 2 = 6 minutes
* Tina can jump rope three times as long as Betsy
* Tina's jump rope time = 6 minutes x 3 = 18 minutes
* The difference between Tina's and Cindy's jump rope time is:
* Tina's time - Cindy's time = 18 minutes - 12 minutes = 6 minutes

Answer: 6 minutes
