Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John eats 1 bag of chips for dinner
* After dinner, he eats twice as many bags of chips as he did for dinner
* To calculate the number of bags he ate after dinner, we take the 1 bag he ate for dinner and multiply it by 2:
* 1 bag x 2 = 2 bags

So, the total number of bags of chips John ate is:
* 1 bag (for dinner) + 2 bags (after dinner) = 3 bags
