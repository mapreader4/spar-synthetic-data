Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first skyscraper was built 100 years ago
* We want to know how many years in the future it will be 5 years before its 200th anniversary of being built
* The 200th anniversary of the skyscraper being built will be 200 years after it was built
* 100 years + 200 years = 300 years
* 5 years before the 200th anniversary is 295 years after the skyscraper was built
* Therefore, the number of years in the future it will be 5 years before the 200th anniversary is 295 - 100 = 195 years

Answer: 195
