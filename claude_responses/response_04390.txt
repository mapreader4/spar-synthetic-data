Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenna has twice as much money in her bank account as Phil.
2) Phil has one-third the amount of money that Bob has in his account.
3) Bob has $60 in his account.

First, let's find out how much money Phil has in his account:
* Bob has $60 in his account.
* Phil has one-third the amount of money that Bob has.
* Therefore, Phil has $60 / 3 = $20 in his account.

Next, let's find out how much money Jenna has in her account:
* Jenna has twice as much money in her bank account as Phil.
* Phil has $20 in his account.
* Therefore, Jenna has $20 x 2 = $40 in her account.

Finally, let's find out how much less money Jenna has in her account than Bob:
* Bob has $60 in his account.
* Jenna has $40 in her account.
* Therefore, Jenna has $60 - $40 = $20 less in her account than Bob.

Answer: $20
