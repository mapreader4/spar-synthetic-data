Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The school library has 120 books
* Each student needs 5 books for their classes
* On the first day, the library helped 4 students
* On the second day, the library helped 5 students
* On the third day, the library helped 6 students
* To find how many students the library can help on the fourth day, we need to calculate how many books have been used so far and how many are left.

First, let's calculate how many books have been used so far:
* 4 students x 5 books per student = 20 books used on the first day
* 5 students x 5 books per student = 25 books used on the second day
* 6 students x 5 books per student = 30 books used on the third day
* Total books used = 20 + 25 + 30 = 75 books

Now, let's calculate how many books are left:
* Total books in the library = 120
* Books used so far = 75
* Books remaining = 120 - 75 = 45 books

Finally, to find how many students the library can help on the fourth day, we divide the remaining books by the number of books each student needs:
* Remaining books = 45
* Books per student = 5
* Students that can be helped on the fourth day = 45 / 5 = 9 students

Answer: 9 students
