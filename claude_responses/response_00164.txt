Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, Buddy has 30 baseball cards.
2. On Tuesday, Buddy loses half of his cards. So, he now has 30 / 2 = 15 baseball cards.
3. On Wednesday, Buddy buys 12 more baseball cards. So, he now has 15 + 12 = 27 baseball cards.
4. On Thursday, Buddy buys a third of what he had on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he had 15 cards, so a third of that is 15 / 3 = 5 cards.
5. Therefore, on Thursday, Buddy has 27 + 5 = 32 baseball cards.

Answer: 32
