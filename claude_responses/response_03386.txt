Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The poodle barks twice for every one time the terrier barks
* The terrier's owner hushes the terrier every second time it barks
* The owner had to say "hush" 6 times before the dogs stopped barking

First, let's figure out how many times the terrier barked:
* The owner had to say "hush" 6 times
* She said "hush" every second time the terrier barked
* So the terrier barked 12 times (6 times when the owner said "hush", and 6 more times in between)

Now, we know that the poodle barks twice for every one time the terrier barks. 
* The terrier barked 12 times
* So the poodle barked 24 times (2 times for each of the 12 times the terrier barked)

Answer: 24
