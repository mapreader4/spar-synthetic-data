Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A mosquito sucks 20 drops of blood every time it feeds on someone
* There are 5000 drops per liter
* You have to lose 3 liters of blood to die

To calculate how many mosquitoes would have to feed on you to kill you, we need to find out how many drops of blood are in 3 liters:
* 3 liters x 5000 drops per liter = 15,000 drops of blood

Now, we need to find out how many times the mosquitoes would have to feed on you to get 15,000 drops of blood:
* 15,000 drops of blood / 20 drops per mosquito = 750 mosquito feedings

Therefore, 750 mosquitoes would have to feed on you to kill you.

Answer: 750
