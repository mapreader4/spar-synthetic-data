Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John travels 150 miles in 2 hours.
2) To find his average speed, we divide the distance (150 miles) by the time (2 hours).
3) Average speed = 150 miles / 2 hours = 75 mph.
4) The speed limit is 60 mph.
5) To find how many mph above the speed limit he was driving, we subtract the speed limit from his average speed.
6) 75 mph - 60 mph = 15 mph.

Answer: 15
