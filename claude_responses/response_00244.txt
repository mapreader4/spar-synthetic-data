Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The fox can run at a maximum speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
2) The time given is 120 minutes.
3) To convert 120 minutes to hours, we divide 120 by 60 minutes per hour, which gives us 2 hours.
4) Since the fox runs at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour, we can calculate the distance by multiplying the speed by the time:
50 kilometers per hour x 2 hours = 100 kilometers.

Answer: 100 kilometers.
