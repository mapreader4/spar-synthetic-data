Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Andy has 4 times as many white socks as he has black socks.
2) He has 6 black socks.
3) So, the number of white socks he has is 4 times the number of black socks, which is 4 * 6 = 24 white socks.
4) He loses half of his white socks, which means he now has 24 / 2 = 12 white socks.
5) The question is asking how many more white socks he still has than black socks.
6) He has 12 white socks and 6 black socks, so the difference is 12 - 6 = 6.
