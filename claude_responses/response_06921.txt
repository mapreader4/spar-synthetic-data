Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Yanni initially had $0.85
2) His mother gave him an additional $0.40
3) So now Yanni has $0.85 + $0.40 = $1.25
4) On the way to the mall, Yanni found $0.50
5) So now Yanni has $1.25 + $0.50 = $1.75
6) Yanni then bought a toy that cost $1.60
7) So now Yanni has $1.75 - $1.60 = $0.15 left
