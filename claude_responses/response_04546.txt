Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gerald has 672 pieces of wood.
2) It takes 12 pieces of wood to make a table.
3) Gerald wants to make 24 tables.
4) So for the 24 tables, he will need 24 * 12 = 288 pieces of wood.
5) It takes 8 pieces of wood to make a chair.
6) The remaining pieces of wood after making the 24 tables is 672 - 288 = 384 pieces.
7) With 384 pieces of wood, he can make 384 / 8 = 48 chairs.
