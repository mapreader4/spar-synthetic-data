Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Doctor Lindsay sees 4 adult patients and 3 child patients every hour
* The cost for an adult's office visit is $50
* The cost for a child's office visit is $25
* We need to calculate the total amount of money she receives in a typical 8-hour day

First, let's calculate the total number of patients she sees in an 8-hour day:
* 4 adult patients + 3 child patients = 7 patients per hour
* 7 patients per hour x 8 hours = 56 patients in a day

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the adult patients:
* 4 adult patients per hour x $50 per visit = $200 per hour
* $200 per hour x 8 hours = $1,600 total for adult patients

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from the child patients:
* 3 child patients per hour x $25 per visit = $75 per hour
* $75 per hour x 8 hours = $600 total for child patients

Finally, we add the total revenue from adult and child patients:
* $1,600 (adult patients) + $600 (child patients) = $2,200

Answer: $2,200
