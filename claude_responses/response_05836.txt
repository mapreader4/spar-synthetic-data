Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kellan bought an 11-ounce bottle of vehicle wax
* He spilled 2 ounces before using it
* So the amount of wax he had available to use was 11 ounces - 2 ounces = 9 ounces
* To detail his car, he used 3 ounces of wax
* To detail his SUV, he used 4 ounces of wax
* So the total amount of wax he used was 3 ounces + 4 ounces = 7 ounces
* The amount of wax he has left is the initial amount he had available (9 ounces) minus the amount he used (7 ounces)
* 9 ounces - 7 ounces = 2 ounces

Answer: 2 ounces
