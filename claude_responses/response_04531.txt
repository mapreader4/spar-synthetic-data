Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The newspaper has a total of 12 pages that each hold 2 photos
* So for the 12 pages with 2 photos each, the total number of photos is:
12 pages x 2 photos per page = 24 photos
* The newspaper also has 9 pages that each hold 3 photos
* So for the 9 pages with 3 photos each, the total number of photos is:
9 pages x 3 photos per page = 27 photos
* To get the total number of photos in the newspaper, we add the photos from the 12 pages and the 9 pages:
24 photos + 27 photos = 51 photos

Answer: 51
