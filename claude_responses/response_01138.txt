Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Jay is saving money from his paycheck every week.
2) He is increasing the amount he saves each week by $10.
3) He started by saving $20 this week.
4) To calculate how much he will have saved in a month (4 weeks), we need to add up the amount he saves each week.
5) Week 1: $20 saved
6) Week 2: $20 + $10 = $30 saved
7) Week 3: $30 + $10 = $40 saved
8) Week 4: $40 + $10 = $50 saved
9) Total saved in a month: $20 + $30 + $40 + $50 = $140

Answer: 140
