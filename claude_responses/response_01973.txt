Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emily spent X dollars on Friday
* She spent twice that amount on Saturday, which is 2X dollars
* She then spent three times X on Sunday, which is 3X dollars
* Over the three days, she spent a total of $120

We can set up an equation to solve for X:
* X + 2X + 3X = 120
* 6X = 120
* X = 20

Therefore, the value of X is $20.

Answer: 20
