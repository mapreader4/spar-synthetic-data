Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John is twice as old as Mary
* John is half as old as Tonya
* Tonya is 60 years old

First, let's find John's age:
* Since John is half as old as Tonya, and Tonya is 60, then John's age is 60 / 2 = 30

Next, let's find Mary's age:
* Since John is twice as old as Mary, and John is 30, then Mary's age is 30 / 2 = 15

Now, we can calculate the average age of the three:
* Average age = (John's age + Mary's age + Tonya's age) / 3
* Average age = (30 + 15 + 60) / 3
* Average age = 105 / 3
* Average age = 35

Answer: 35
