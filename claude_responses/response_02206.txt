Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shanna planted 6 tomato plants, 2 eggplant plants, and 4 pepper plants
* Half of the tomato plants died, so that's 3 tomato plants remaining
* 1 pepper plant died, so there are 3 pepper plants remaining
* The 2 eggplant plants did not die
* Each remaining plant gave her 7 vegetables
* So for the 3 tomato plants, she got 3 * 7 = 21 tomatoes
* For the 2 eggplant plants, she got 2 * 7 = 14 eggplants
* For the 3 pepper plants, she got 3 * 7 = 21 peppers
* Adding these up, we get:
   - 21 tomatoes
   - 14 eggplants
   - 21 peppers
* The total number of vegetables she had to harvest is:
   - 21 + 14 + 21 = 56

Answer: 56
