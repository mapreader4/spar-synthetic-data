Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 3 CDs
* Two of the CDs are 1.5 hours each
* The last CD is twice as long as the other two CDs
* To find the combined length of the CDs, we need to add up the lengths of all three CDs

First, let's find the length of the third CD:
* The third CD is twice as long as the other two CDs
* The other two CDs are 1.5 hours each
* So the third CD is 2 x 1.5 = 3 hours

Now, let's add up the lengths of all three CDs:
* 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
