Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The warehouse is 600 feet long and 400 feet wide
* The perimeter of the warehouse is 2 * (600 feet + 400 feet) = 2000 feet
* Carson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times
* However, he skips 2 times
* So, he circles the warehouse 8 times
* The total distance he walks is 8 * 2000 feet = 16,000 feet

Answer: 16,000 feet
