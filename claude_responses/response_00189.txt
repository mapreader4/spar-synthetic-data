Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Thor is 13 times older than Captain America. So if Thor is 1456 years old, then Captain America's age is 1456 / 13 = 112 years old.
2) Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker. So if Captain America is 112 years old, then Peter Parker's age is 112 / 7 = 16 years old.
3) Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker. So if Peter Parker is 16 years old, then Ironman's age is 16 + 32 = 48 years old.

Answer: 48
