Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The sprinkler system runs twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.
* In the morning, it uses 4 liters of water.
* In the evening, it uses 6 liters of water.
* So, the total amount of water used per day is:
    - Morning: 4 liters
    - Evening: 6 liters
    - Total per day: 4 + 6 = 10 liters
* The question asks how many days it takes to use 50 liters of water.
* To find this, we divide the total amount of water (50 liters) by the amount of water used per day (10 liters).
* 50 liters / 10 liters per day = 5 days
