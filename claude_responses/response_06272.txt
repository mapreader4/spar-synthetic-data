Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are a total of 5 green candies, 3 blue candies, and 4 red candies in the bag.
2) The total number of candies in the bag is 5 + 3 + 4 = 12.
3) The probability of Violet picking a blue candy is the number of blue candies divided by the total number of candies.
4) The number of blue candies is 3.
5) The total number of candies is 12.
6) Therefore, the probability of Violet picking a blue candy is 3/12 = 1/4.

Answer: 1/4
