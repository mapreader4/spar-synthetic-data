Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Missy has an obedient dog and a stubborn dog
* She has to yell at the stubborn dog 4 times for every 1 time she yells at the obedient dog
* She yells at the obedient dog 12 times

To find the total number of times she yells at both dogs combined, we need to:
1. Find the number of times she yells at the stubborn dog
2. Add the number of times she yells at the obedient dog (12) to the number of times she yells at the stubborn dog

To find the number of times she yells at the stubborn dog:
* For every 1 time she yells at the obedient dog, she yells at the stubborn dog 4 times
* Since she yells at the obedient dog 12 times, we can multiply 12 by 4 to get the number of times she yells at the stubborn dog
* 12 x 4 = 48 times she yells at the stubborn dog

Now we add the number of times she yells at the obedient dog (12) to the number of times she yells at the stubborn dog (48):
* 12 + 48 = 60 times she yells at both dogs combined

Answer: 60
