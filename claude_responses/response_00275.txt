Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Hansel's original salary is $30,000 per year.
2. Hansel received a 10% raise, which means his new salary is:
   * 10% of $30,000 = $3,000
   * $30,000 + $3,000 = $33,000

3. Gretel's original salary is also $30,000 per year.
4. Gretel received a 15% raise, which means her new salary is:
   * 15% of $30,000 = $4,500
   * $30,000 + $4,500 = $34,500

5. To find the difference between Gretel's and Hansel's new salaries, we subtract:
   * $34,500 - $33,000 = $1,500

Answer: $1,500
