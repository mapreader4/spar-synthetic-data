Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sheila had saved $3,000 by last week.
2) She plans to save $276 per month for the next 4 years.
   * 4 years = 48 months
   * 48 months x $276 per month = $13,248 saved over 4 years
3) Sheila's family secretly added $7,000 into the piggy bank today.
4) To calculate the total amount in the piggy bank at the end of 4 years:
   * Starting amount: $3,000
   * Amount saved over 4 years: $13,248
   * Amount added by family: $7,000
   * Total amount: $3,000 + $13,248 + $7,000 = $23,248

Answer: $23,248
