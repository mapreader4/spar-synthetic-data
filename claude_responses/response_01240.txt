Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Harry and Kevin have $200 to spend.
2) They spend $42 on a giant sheet, $18 on a rope, and $14 on a propane tank and burner.
3) This means they have $200 - $42 - $18 - $14 = $126 left to spend on helium.
4) The helium costs $1.50 per ounce.
5) So the amount of helium they can buy with the remaining $126 is $126 / $1.50 = 84 ounces.
6) For every ounce of helium, the balloon can fly 113 feet higher.
7) So with 84 ounces of helium, the balloon can fly 84 * 113 = 9,492 feet up.

Answer: 9,492 feet
