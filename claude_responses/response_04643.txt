Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You borrowed $100 from your friend last month
* You agreed to pay back the $100 with a 10% increase
* To calculate the 10% increase:
  * 10% of $100 is $10 (10% of the original amount)
* So the total amount you need to pay back is:
  * $100 (original amount) + $10 (10% increase) = $110

Therefore, the amount you will give to your friend is:
Answer: 110
