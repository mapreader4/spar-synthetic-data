Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John made $30,000 doing Uber without factoring in the cost of depreciation for his car.
2) He bought a car for $18,000.
3) When he traded in the car, he got $6,000 back.
4) To calculate his profit, we need to subtract the cost of the car and the amount he got back from trading it in from the $30,000 he made.
5) $30,000 - $18,000 + $6,000 = $18,000.

Answer: 18,000
