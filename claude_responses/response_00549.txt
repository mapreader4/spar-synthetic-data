Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kenzo has 80 office chairs, each with 5 legs. So the total number of legs for the chairs is:
   80 chairs x 5 legs per chair = 400 legs

2. Kenzo has 20 round tables, each with 3 legs. So the total number of legs for the tables is:
   20 tables x 3 legs per table = 60 legs

3. The total number of legs for all the furniture is the sum of the chair legs and the table legs:
   400 legs + 60 legs = 460 legs

4. After a month, 40% of the chairs are damaged and have to be disposed of. That means 40% of the 80 chairs, which is 32 chairs, will be removed.
   80 chairs - 32 damaged chairs = 48 chairs remaining

5. The number of legs for the remaining 48 chairs is:
   48 chairs x 5 legs per chair = 240 legs

6. The total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining in his company is the number of legs for the remaining chairs plus the number of legs for the tables:
   240 legs + 60 legs = 300 legs

Answer: 300
