Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of the phone is $1300.
2) Mike already has 40% of the amount he needs.
3) To calculate how much money Mike already has, we take 40% of $1300:
   * 40% of $1300 = 0.4 * $1300 = $520
4) Now, to calculate how much more money Mike needs, we subtract the amount he already has ($520) from the total cost of the phone ($1300):
   * $1300 - $520 = $780
Therefore, the amount of money Mike needs is $780.

Answer: 780
