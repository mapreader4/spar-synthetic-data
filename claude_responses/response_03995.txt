Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that each tile is 6 square inches.
2) The kitchen floor is 48 inches by 72 inches.
3) To find the total area of the kitchen floor, we multiply the length and width:
   48 inches x 72 inches = 3,456 square inches
4) To find the number of tiles needed, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile:
   3,456 square inches / 6 square inches per tile = 576 tiles
Answer: 576
