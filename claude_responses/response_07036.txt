Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Debora has 12 more dresses than Melissa.
2) Melissa has half the number of dresses that Emily has.
3) Emily has 16 dresses.
4) So, Melissa has half of 16, which is 8 dresses.
5) Debora has 12 more dresses than Melissa, so Debora has 8 + 12 = 20 dresses.
6) To find the total number of dresses, we add up the dresses of all three:
   Emily: 16 dresses
   Melissa: 8 dresses
   Debora: 20 dresses
   Total: 16 + 8 + 20 = 44 dresses.

Answer: 44
