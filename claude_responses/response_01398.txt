Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of the boots is $90.
2) There is a discount of 20% on the original price.
3) To calculate the discounted price, we take the original price and subtract 20% of the original price.
4) 20% of $90 is 0.20 * $90 = $18.
5) Subtracting the discount of $18 from the original price of $90 gives us the discounted price of $72.
Answer: $72.
