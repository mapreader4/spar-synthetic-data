Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Calvin has gotten 8 haircuts so far
* He needs 2 more haircuts to reach his goal
* To calculate the percentage towards his goal, we need to find the total number of haircuts required and then calculate the percentage of that total that he has already completed

The total number of haircuts required is:
* 8 haircuts (already completed) + 2 more haircuts (needed) = 10 total haircuts

Now, to calculate the percentage:
* Calvin has completed 8 out of the 10 total haircuts
* 8 / 10 = 0.8
* 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, Calvin is 80% towards his goal.

Answer: 80
