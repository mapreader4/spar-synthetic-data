Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 24 marbles in the jar total
* Half of the marbles are blue, so there are 12 blue marbles
* There are 6 red marbles
* The remaining marbles must be orange

To find the number of orange marbles, we need to subtract the blue and red marbles from the total:
* Total marbles: 24
* Blue marbles: 12
* Red marbles: 6
* Orange marbles = Total - Blue - Red
* Orange marbles = 24 - 12 - 6 = 6

Answer: 6
