Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 85 paper stars are required to fill a glass jar
* Luke has already made 33 stars
* Luke needs to fill 4 bottles

To find the number of additional stars Luke must make, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of stars required for 4 bottles
2. Subtract the number of stars Luke has already made (33)

Step 1: Total number of stars required for 4 bottles
* 85 stars per bottle x 4 bottles = 340 stars

Step 2: Subtract the number of stars Luke has already made
* 340 stars - 33 stars = 307 stars

Answer: 307
