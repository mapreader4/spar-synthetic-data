Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair.
2) Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair.
3) Logan's hair is 20 inches long.
4) So, Emily's hair is 20 + 6 = 26 inches long.
5) Since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair, that means Kate's hair is 26 / 2 = 13 inches long.

Answer: 13 inches
