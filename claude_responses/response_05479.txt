Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The guy bought 5 sets of drill bits.
2) Each set cost $6.
3) To calculate the total cost of the drill bits, we multiply the number of sets (5) by the cost per set ($6):
5 sets x $6 per set = $30 total cost of drill bits.
4) The guy then paid a 10% tax on the order.
5) To calculate the tax, we take the total cost of the drill bits ($30) and multiply it by the tax rate (10%):
$30 x 0.10 = $3 tax.
6) To get the total amount paid, we add the total cost of the drill bits ($30) and the tax ($3):
$30 + $3 = $33.
