Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John writes 20 pages a day
* Each book is 400 pages
* John needs to write 3 books

To find the total number of pages John needs to write, we can multiply the number of books (3) by the number of pages per book (400):
* 3 books x 400 pages per book = 1,200 total pages

Now, to find how long it will take John to write 1,200 pages, we can divide the total pages by the number of pages he writes per day:
* 1,200 pages / 20 pages per day = 60 days

Therefore, it will take John 60 days to write 3 books that are 400 pages each.

Answer: 60
