Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Miley bought two cellphones, and each cellphone costs $800.
2) The total cost of the two cellphones without any discount would be:
   2 cellphones x $800 per cellphone = $1,600
3) Miley will receive a 5% discount on the total cost.
4) The discount amount is 5% of $1,600, which is:
   0.05 x $1,600 = $80
5) The total amount Miley will pay after the 5% discount is:
   $1,600 - $80 = $1,520

Answer: 1,520
