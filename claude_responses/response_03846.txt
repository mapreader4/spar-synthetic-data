Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenny lives 5000 feet from her school, and she drops 1 kernel of popcorn per 25 feet she walks.
2) So, the total number of popcorn kernels she dropped on her way home is:
5000 feet / 25 feet per kernel = 200 kernels
3) Later that evening, a squirrel came and ate one-quarter of the popcorn Jenny had dropped.
4) One-quarter of 200 kernels is 50 kernels.
5) So, the number of popcorn kernels remaining on the ground is:
200 kernels - 50 kernels = 150 kernels
Answer: 150
