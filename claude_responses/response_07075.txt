Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The owner divided the sugar into 12 packs.
2) Each pack weighs 250 grams.
3) There is 20 grams of sugar left.
4) To find the total amount of sugar the owner started with, we need to calculate the total weight of the 12 packs, plus the 20 grams of sugar left.
5) The total weight of the 12 packs is 12 * 250 = 3000 grams.
6) Adding the 20 grams of sugar left, the total amount of sugar the owner started with is 3000 + 20 = 3020 grams.

Answer: 3020
