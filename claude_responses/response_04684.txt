Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Let's define the variables:
   - Let x = the amount of rain in the first hour
   - Let y = the amount of rain in the second hour

2) We know that in the second hour, it rained 7 inches more than twice the amount it rained the first hour. So:
   y = 2x + 7

3) We also know that the total amount of rain in the first two hours is 22 inches. So:
   x + y = 22

4) Substituting the expression for y from step 2 into the equation in step 3, we get:
   x + 2x + 7 = 22
   3x + 7 = 22
   3x = 15
   x = 5

Therefore, it rained 5 inches in the first hour.
