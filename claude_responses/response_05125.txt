Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jonathan ran 7.5 kilometers.
2) Mercedes ran twice the distance that Jonathan ran, which means Mercedes ran 2 * 7.5 = 15 kilometers.
3) Davonte ran 2 kilometers farther than Mercedes, which means Davonte ran 15 + 2 = 17 kilometers.
4) The total distance run by Mercedes and Davonte is 15 + 17 = 32 kilometers.

Answer: 32
