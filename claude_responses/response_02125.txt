Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* We know that for every 1 year a human ages, a dog ages 7 years.
* Max is 3 years old.
* Max's dog is also 3 years old.
* To find how much older, in dog years, Max's dog will be, we need to calculate the difference in dog years between Max and his dog.
* Since Max is 3 years old, in dog years he would be 3 * 7 = 21 years old.
* Since Max's dog is also 3 years old, in dog years it would be 3 * 7 = 21 years old.
* The difference in dog years between Max and his dog is 21 - 21 = 0 years.
