Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Linda makes $10.00 an hour babysitting
* There is a $25.00 application fee for each college application she submits
* She is applying to 6 colleges

To calculate the total cost of the application fees, we multiply the number of colleges (6) by the application fee ($25.00):
* 6 colleges x $25.00 per application = $150.00 total

Now, to determine how many hours Linda needs to babysit to cover the application fees, we divide the total cost ($150.00) by her hourly rate ($10.00 per hour):
* $150.00 / $10.00 per hour = 15 hours

Answer: 15 hours
