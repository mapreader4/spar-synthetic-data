Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Keith scored 3 points on the math test.
2) Larry scored 3 times as many marks as Keith. So, Larry scored 3 x 3 = 9 marks.
3) Danny scored 5 more marks than Larry. So, Danny scored 9 + 5 = 14 marks.
4) To find the total amount of marks scored by the three students, we add up the marks for each student:
   Keith's marks: 3
   Larry's marks: 9
   Danny's marks: 14
   Total marks = 3 + 9 + 14 = 26

Answer: 26
