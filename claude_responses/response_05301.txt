Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first character has 8 more lines than the second character.
2) The third character only has 2 lines.
3) The second character has 6 more than 3 times the number of lines the third character has.
4) So, the number of lines for the third character is 2.
5) The number of lines for the second character is 3 times the number of lines for the third character, plus 6.
6) 3 x 2 = 6, and 6 + 6 = 12.
7) So the second character has 12 lines.
8) The first character has 8 more lines than the second character, so the first character has 12 + 8 = 20 lines.

Answer: 20
