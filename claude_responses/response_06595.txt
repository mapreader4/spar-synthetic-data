Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Drew is 5 years older than Maya
2) Peter is 4 years older than Drew
3) John is 30 and is twice as old as Maya
4) In 2 years, Jacob will be exactly half of Peter's age

First, let's find Maya's age:
* John is 30 and is twice as old as Maya
* Therefore, Maya's age is 30 / 2 = 15

Now, let's find Drew's age:
* Drew is 5 years older than Maya
* Therefore, Drew's age is 15 + 5 = 20

Next, let's find Peter's age:
* Peter is 4 years older than Drew
* Therefore, Peter's age is 20 + 4 = 24

Finally, let's find Jacob's age:
* In 2 years, Jacob will be exactly half of Peter's age
* Therefore, in 2 years, Jacob's age will be 24 / 2 = 12
* So, Jacob's current age is 12 - 2 = 10
