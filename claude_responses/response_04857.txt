Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 6 peregrine falcons and 40 pigeons nesting in Malcolm's skyscraper.
2) Each pigeon has 6 chicks.
3) To find the total number of pigeons, we add the 40 adult pigeons to the number of chicks:
   40 adult pigeons + (40 pigeons x 6 chicks per pigeon) = 40 + 240 = 280 pigeons
4) The peregrine falcons eat 30% of the pigeons.
5) 30% of 280 pigeons is 0.3 x 280 = 84 pigeons.
6) The number of pigeons left is the total number of pigeons (280) minus the number of pigeons eaten by the peregrine falcons (84).

Answer: 196 pigeons
