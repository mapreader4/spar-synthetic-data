Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The magician charges $60 per hour
* The magician works 3 hours every day
* The magician works for 2 weeks (14 days)
* To calculate the total amount paid:
  * The magician works 3 hours per day
  * So in 1 day, the magician earns 3 x $60 = $180
  * In 2 weeks (14 days), the magician earns 14 x $180 = $2,520

Answer: $2,520
