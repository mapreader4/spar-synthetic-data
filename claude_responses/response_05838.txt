Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mark's pond is 4 feet deeper than 3 times Peter's pond.
2) This means that if we call the depth of Peter's pond "x", then the depth of Mark's pond is 3x + 4.
3) We are told that Mark's pond is 19 feet deep, so we can set up the equation:
3x + 4 = 19
4) Solving for x, we get:
3x = 15
x = 5
Therefore, the depth of Peter's pond is 5 feet.
