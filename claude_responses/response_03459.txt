Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Kristine has 7 more CDs than Dawn.
2) We also know that Dawn has 10 CDs.
3) To find how many CDs Kristine has, we add 7 to Dawn's 10 CDs:
   Kristine's CDs = Dawn's CDs + 7
   Kristine's CDs = 10 + 7 = 17 CDs
4) Now we can find the total number of CDs they have together by adding Dawn's CDs and Kristine's CDs:
   Total CDs = Dawn's CDs + Kristine's CDs
   Total CDs = 10 + 17 = 27 CDs

Answer: 27
