Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years
* Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people
* Each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship

So, we can assume that the monster ate ships in the following years:
* 0-100 years
* 100-200 years
* 200-300 years

Since the number of people on each ship doubles, we can represent the number of people on each ship as follows:
* Ship 1 (0-100 years): x people
* Ship 2 (100-200 years): 2x people
* Ship 3 (200-300 years): 4x people

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
* x + 2x + 4x = 847
* 7x = 847
* x = 121

Therefore, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years was 121.

Answer: 121
