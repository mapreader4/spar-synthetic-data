Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The tree initially had 340 leaves.
2) Over the first four days, the tree drops a tenth of its initial quantity of leaves each day.
   * Day 1: 340 * 0.1 = 34 leaves dropped
   * Day 2: 340 * 0.1 = 34 leaves dropped
   * Day 3: 340 * 0.1 = 34 leaves dropped
   * Day 4: 340 * 0.1 = 34 leaves dropped
3) The total number of leaves dropped over the first four days is:
   * 34 + 34 + 34 + 34 = 136 leaves
4) On the fifth day, the tree drops the remaining leaves.
   * The initial quantity of leaves was 340.
   * The number of leaves dropped over the first four days was 136.
   * Therefore, the number of leaves dropped on the fifth day is:
     * 340 - 136 = 204 leaves

Answer: 204 leaves
