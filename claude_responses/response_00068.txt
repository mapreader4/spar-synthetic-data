Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The ratio of coins that Elsa has to Amalie is 10:45.
2) The total number of coins they have is 440.
3) To find the number of coins each person has, we can set up a proportion:
   (Elsa's coins) / (Amalie's coins) = 10 / 45
   Let x = Elsa's coins and y = Amalie's coins
   x / y = 10 / 45
   Solving for x and y, we get:
   x = 10 / 55 * 440 = 80 coins
   y = 45 / 55 * 440 = 360 coins
4) Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys.
   Amalie's remaining coins = 1/4 * 360 = 90 coins.

Answer: 90 coins.
