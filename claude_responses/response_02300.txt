Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Josh's work hours per month:
   * 8 hours per day
   * 5 days per week
   * 4 weeks per month
   * Total hours per month = 8 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 hours

2. Carl's work hours per month:
   * Carl works 2 hours less than Josh every day
   * 8 hours/day - 2 hours/day = 6 hours/day
   * 6 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 120 hours

3. Josh's monthly pay:
   * $9/hour
   * 160 hours/month
   * Total pay = $9/hour * 160 hours/month = $1,440

4. Carl's monthly pay:
   * $9/hour / 2 = $4.50/hour
   * 120 hours/month
   * Total pay = $4.50/hour * 120 hours/month = $540

5. Total monthly pay for both Josh and Carl:
   * Josh's pay: $1,440
   * Carl's pay: $540
   * Total pay = $1,440 + $540 = $1,980

Answer: $1,980
