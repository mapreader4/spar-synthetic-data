Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The video streaming subscription costs $14 per month
* You are splitting the cost evenly with your friend
* We need to calculate the total cost after the first year

First, let's calculate the monthly cost for each person:
* $14 per month / 2 people = $7 per month per person

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the first year:
* $7 per month x 12 months = $84 per person

Therefore, the total amount you pay after the first year for this service is:

Answer: $84
