Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ken can do 20 sit-ups without stopping.
2) Nathan can do twice as many sit-ups as Ken, which means Nathan can do 20 x 2 = 40 sit-ups.
3) The combined number of sit-ups that Ken and Nathan can do is 20 + 40 = 60 sit-ups.
4) Bob can do half the number of Ken and Nathan's combined sit-ups, which means Bob can do 60 / 2 = 30 sit-ups.
5) The difference between the number of sit-ups that Bob can do and the number of sit-ups that Ken can do is 30 - 20 = 10 sit-ups.
