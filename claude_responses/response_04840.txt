Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Noel bakes 4 dozen donuts. 4 dozen = 4 x 12 = 48 donuts.
2) There are 30 students in the class.
3) 80% of the students like donuts. 80% of 30 = 0.8 x 30 = 24 students like donuts.
4) To find how many donuts each student who likes donuts gets to eat, we divide the total number of donuts (48) by the number of students who like donuts (24).
48 donuts / 24 students = 2 donuts per student.
