Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Juniper has 12 whiskers
* Puffy has three times more whiskers than Juniper
* Puffy's whiskers = 3 x 12 = 36 whiskers
* Scruffy has twice as many whiskers as Puffy
* Scruffy's whiskers = 2 x 36 = 72 whiskers
* Buffy has the same number of whiskers as the average number of whiskers on the three other cats
* The average number of whiskers on Puffy, Scruffy, and Juniper is:
    (36 + 72 + 12) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40 whiskers
* Therefore, Buffy has 40 whiskers.

Answer: 40
