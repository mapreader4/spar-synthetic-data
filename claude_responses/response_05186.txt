Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. 8 years ago, James was twice Janet's age.
   * Let's call Janet's age 8 years ago as x.
   * Then, James' age 8 years ago was 2x.

2. In 15 years, James will turn 37.
   * James' current age is 37 - 15 = 22.
   * So, James' age 8 years ago was 22 - 8 = 14.
   * Therefore, 2x = 14, and x = 7.
   * Janet's age 8 years ago was 7.

3. Susan was born when Janet turned 3.
   * Janet is currently 7 + 8 = 15 years old.
   * Susan is currently 15 - 3 = 12 years old.

4. In 5 years, Susan will turn 12 + 5 = 17 years old.
