Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The flag is 5 feet wide and 4 feet tall.
2) The area of one side of the flag is 5 feet x 4 feet = 20 square feet.
3) Since Tommy needs to paint both sides, the total area to be painted is 2 x 20 square feet = 40 square feet.
4) We know that a quart of paint covers 4 square feet.
5) To calculate the number of quarts needed, we divide the total area to be painted (40 square feet) by the area covered per quart (4 square feet).
6) 40 square feet / 4 square feet per quart = 10 quarts.
7) Each quart of paint costs $2.
8) Therefore, the total cost of the paint is 10 quarts x $2 per quart = $20.

Answer: $20
