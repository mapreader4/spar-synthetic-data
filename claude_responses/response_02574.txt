Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.
2) Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.
   * Yvonne swims 10 laps, so her sister swims 5 laps (half of 10).
3) Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.
   * The youngest sister swims 5 laps, so Joel swims 15 laps (3 times 5).

Answer: 15 laps
