Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The dental office gives away 2 toothbrushes to every patient who visits.
2) Each patient visit takes 0.5 hours.
3) The dentist works 8 hours per day.
4) The dentist works 5 days per week.
5) To calculate the number of patients the dentist sees in a 5-day work week:
   - The dentist works 8 hours per day
   - Each patient visit takes 0.5 hours
   - So the dentist can see 8 / 0.5 = 16 patients per day
   - In a 5-day work week, the dentist can see 16 * 5 = 80 patients
6) Since the dentist gives away 2 toothbrushes per patient, the total number of toothbrushes given away in a 5-day work week is:
   - 80 patients * 2 toothbrushes per patient = 160 toothbrushes

Answer: 160
