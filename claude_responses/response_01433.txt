Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Hank Aaron hit 755 home runs in his career.
2) Hank Aaron has 175 fewer than twice the number that Dave Winfield has.
3) Let's call the number of home runs that Dave Winfield hit as "x".
4) Then, Hank Aaron has 2x - 175 home runs.
5) We know that Hank Aaron has 755 home runs, so we can set up the equation:
   755 = 2x - 175
6) Solving for x, we get:
   755 + 175 = 2x
   930 = 2x
   x = 465
Answer: Dave Winfield hit 465 home runs in his career.
