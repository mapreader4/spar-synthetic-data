Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Samir climbed 318 stairs yesterday.
2) Veronica climbed 18 more than half of the amount that Samir climbed.
3) To find half of the amount that Samir climbed, we divide 318 by 2, which is 159.
4) Veronica climbed 18 more than 159, so she climbed 159 + 18 = 177 stairs.
5) To find the total number of stairs that Veronica and Samir climbed together, we add their individual amounts:
318 + 177 = 495.

Answer: 495
