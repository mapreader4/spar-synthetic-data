Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Billy's family owns a total of 4 bicycles
* Each bicycle has 2 wheels
* Each wheel has 10 spokes
* To find the total number of spokes, we need to:
  1. Calculate the number of spokes per bicycle
  2. Multiply the number of spokes per bicycle by the total number of bicycles

Step 1: Calculating the number of spokes per bicycle
* Each bicycle has 2 wheels
* Each wheel has 10 spokes
* So, the number of spokes per bicycle is 2 x 10 = 20 spokes

Step 2: Calculating the total number of spokes
* There are 4 bicycles
* Each bicycle has 20 spokes
* So, the total number of spokes is 4 x 20 = 80 spokes

Answer: 80
