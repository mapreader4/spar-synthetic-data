Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alan has 8 pine trees in his backyard.
2) Each tree drops 200 pine cones.
3) So the total number of pine cones dropped is 8 trees x 200 pine cones per tree = 1,600 pine cones.
4) 30% of the pine cones fall on Alan's roof.
5) To calculate 30% of 1,600 pine cones, we multiply 1,600 by 0.30 (30% expressed as a decimal): 1,600 x 0.30 = 480 pine cones.
6) Each pine cone weighs 4 ounces.
7) To calculate the total weight of the pine cones on Alan's roof, we multiply 480 pine cones by 4 ounces per pine cone: 480 x 4 = 1,920 ounces.

Answer: 1,920 ounces.
