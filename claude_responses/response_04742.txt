Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Molly has 2 parents
* Molly has 3 brothers
* Each of Molly's 3 brothers is married, so that's 3 more people
* Each of Molly's 3 brothers has 2 children, so that's 6 more people
* In total, Molly has 2 parents + 3 brothers + 3 spouses + 6 children = 14 relatives
* Molly sends one package to each relative
* Each package costs $5
* To calculate the total cost, we multiply the number of relatives (14) by the cost per package ($5)
* 14 relatives x $5 per package = $70

Answer: $70
