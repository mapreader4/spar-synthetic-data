Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* There are 9 bicycles in the garage
* Each bicycle has 2 wheels
* So the total number of wheels from the bicycles is 9 * 2 = 18 wheels
* There are 16 cars in the garage
* Each car has 4 wheels
* So the total number of wheels from the cars is 16 * 4 = 64 wheels
* To find the total number of wheels in the garage, we add the wheels from the bicycles and the cars:
* 18 wheels + 64 wheels = 82 wheels

Answer: 82
