Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Will's mom gave him $74 to go shopping.
2) He bought a sweater for $9, a T-shirt for $11, and a pair of shoes for $30.
3) The total amount he spent on these items is $9 + $11 + $30 = $50.
4) He then returned the shoes for a 90% refund. The original price of the shoes was $30, so the refund amount is 90% of $30, which is $27.
5) To calculate the amount of money Will has left, we start with the $74 his mom gave him, subtract the $50 he spent, and add the $27 refund.
6) $74 - $50 + $27 = $51.
