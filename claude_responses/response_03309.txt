Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Denver uses 7 pieces of wood for each birdhouse.
2) He pays $1.50 for each piece of wood.
3) He makes a $5.50 profit per birdhouse.
4) To calculate the cost of materials for each birdhouse, we multiply the number of pieces of wood (7) by the cost per piece ($1.50):
7 pieces of wood x $1.50 per piece = $10.50 in materials per birdhouse.
5) To calculate the selling price per birdhouse, we add the cost of materials ($10.50) to the profit per birdhouse ($5.50):
$10.50 + $5.50 = $16.00 selling price per birdhouse.
6) Danny wants to buy 2 birdhouses, so the total charge will be:
2 birdhouses x $16.00 per birdhouse = $32.00.

Answer: $32.00
