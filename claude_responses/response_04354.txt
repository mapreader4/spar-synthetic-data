Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joe's dad has 21 marshmallows.
2) Joe has four times as much marshmallows as his dad, which means Joe has 4 x 21 = 84 marshmallows.
3) Joe's dad roasts a third of his marshmallows, which means he roasts 21 / 3 = 7 marshmallows.
4) Joe roasts half of his marshmallows, which means he roasts 84 / 2 = 42 marshmallows.
5) In total, they roasted 7 + 42 = 49 marshmallows.

Answer: 49
