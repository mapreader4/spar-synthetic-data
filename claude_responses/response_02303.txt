Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cynthia has four times as many water balloons as her husband, Randy.
* Randy has only half as many water balloons as his daughter, Janice.
* Janice has 6 water balloons.

First, let's find out how many water balloons Randy has:
* Janice has 6 water balloons
* Randy has half as many as Janice
* So, Randy has 6 / 2 = 3 water balloons

Now, let's find out how many water balloons Cynthia has:
* Cynthia has four times as many water balloons as Randy
* Randy has 3 water balloons
* So, Cynthia has 4 x 3 = 12 water balloons

Therefore, Cynthia has 12 water balloons that she could choose to throw at Randy.

Answer: 12
