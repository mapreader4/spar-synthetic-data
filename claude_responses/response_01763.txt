Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You and your brother have 30 minutes to get to school without being late.
* It takes 15 minutes to get to the school gate.
* It takes an additional 6 minutes to get from the school gate to the school building.
* So the total time it takes to get from your starting point to the school building is 15 minutes + 6 minutes = 21 minutes.
* To find the time you have left to get to your room, we subtract the total time to get to the school building (21 minutes) from the total time you have (30 minutes).
* 30 minutes - 21 minutes = 9 minutes.

Answer: 9 minutes.
