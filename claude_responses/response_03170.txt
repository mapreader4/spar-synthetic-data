Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first lock stalls the raccoons for 5 minutes.
* The second lock stalls the raccoons for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock.
* To find the time for the second lock, we can use the following equation:
    * Time for second lock = 3 x Time for first lock - 3 minutes
    * Time for second lock = 3 x 5 minutes - 3 minutes
    * Time for second lock = 12 minutes
* When both locks are used together, it stalls the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone.
* So, the total time the raccoons are stalled when both locks are used is:
    * Total time = 5 x Time for second lock
    * Total time = 5 x 12 minutes
    * Total time = 60 minutes

Answer: 60
