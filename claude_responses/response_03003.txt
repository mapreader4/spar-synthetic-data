Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In mid-May, the depth of the river is measured, but we don't know the exact depth yet.
* By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May.
* By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June.
* In mid-July, the river is 45 feet deep.

Let's start by finding the depth of the river in mid-June.
* If the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, and it is three times deeper than mid-June, then the depth in mid-June must be 45 / 3 = 15 feet.

Now we can find the depth of the river in mid-May.
* We know that by mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May.
* So if the river is 15 feet deep in mid-June, then it must have been 15 - 10 = 5 feet deep in mid-May.

Answer: 5 feet
