Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie.
2) The rest of the pie, which is 5/6 of the pie, was put in the fridge.
3) The pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams.
4) Since the pie left in the fridge is 5/6 of the original pie, we can calculate the original weight of the pie:
* 1200 grams / (5/6) = 1440 grams
5) If the original pie weighed 1440 grams, and Sophia ate 1/6 of it, then the amount Sophia ate is:
* 1440 grams * (1/6) = 240 grams

Answer: 240 grams
