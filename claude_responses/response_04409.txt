Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The supermarket receives 15 cases of tins of beans.
2) Each case contains 24 tins.
3) To find the total number of tins, we multiply the number of cases (15) by the number of tins per case (24):
15 cases x 24 tins/case = 360 tins
4) 5% of the tins are damaged and thrown away. To find the number of damaged tins, we take 5% of the total number of tins:
0.05 x 360 tins = 18 damaged tins
5) To find the number of tins left, we subtract the number of damaged tins from the total number of tins:
360 tins - 18 damaged tins = 342 tins

Answer: 342
