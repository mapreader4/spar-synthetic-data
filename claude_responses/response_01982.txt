Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elijah has 2 walls that are 4 meters wide
* Elijah has 2 walls that are 6 meters wide
* He needs enough masking tape to cover the entire width of each wall
* To calculate the total amount of masking tape needed, we add up the widths of all 4 walls:
* 2 walls x 4 meters = 8 meters
* 2 walls x 6 meters = 12 meters
* 8 meters + 12 meters = 20 meters

Answer: 20 meters
