Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Greg and Katie went to Mrs. Scarlet's gold store
* They had their gold chests opened
* It was revealed that Greg had four times less gold than Katie
* The total amount of gold is 100

To find how much gold Greg has, we can use the following logic:
* If Greg has four times less gold than Katie, that means Katie has four times more gold than Greg
* Let's say Greg has x amount of gold
* Then Katie has 4x amount of gold
* The total amount of gold is 100, so x + 4x = 100
* Solving for x, we get x = 20

Answer: 20
