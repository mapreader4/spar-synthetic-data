Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Renata started with $10 on Saturday morning.
* She made a $4 donation to the local charity draw and won $90 as the 5th prize.
* So after the charity draw, she had $10 + $90 - $4 = $96.
* She then went to the casino and lost $50, $10, and $5 at the slot machines.
* So after the casino, she had $96 - $50 - $10 - $5 = $31.
* She then bought a $1 bottle of water and a $1 lottery ticket.
* She won an instant prize of $65 on the lottery ticket.
* So her final amount is $31 + $65 - $1 - $1 = $94.

Answer: 94
