Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each student needs 2 sandwiches
* Each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 other students)
* There are a total of 5 groups

First, we need to calculate the total number of students:
* 6 students per group x 5 groups = 30 students

Next, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches needed:
* 2 sandwiches per student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of bread needed:
* 2 pieces of bread per sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 pieces of bread

Answer: 120
