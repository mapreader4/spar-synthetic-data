Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of the aquarium was $120.
2) The aquarium was marked down by 50%, so the reduced price is:
   $120 - (50% of $120) = $120 - $60 = $60
3) Axel also had to pay 5% sales tax on the reduced price of $60.
   5% of $60 = 0.05 * $60 = $3
4) The total cost of the aquarium is the reduced price plus the sales tax:
   $60 + $3 = $63

Answer: 63
