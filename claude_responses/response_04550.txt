Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Johannes sells cabbage for $2 per kilogram.
2) Last Wednesday, he earned $30.
3) Last Friday, he earned $24.
4) Today, he earned $42.
5) To find the total number of kilograms of cabbage he sold, we need to add up the earnings from each day and divide by the price per kilogram.
6) Total earnings = $30 + $24 + $42 = $96
7) Divide the total earnings by the price per kilogram: $96 / $2 per kg = 48 kilograms.

Answer: 48
