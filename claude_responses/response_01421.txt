Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Xavier needs 84 paper plates for the housewarming party.
2) He already has 21 green plates and 28 red plates.
3) To calculate the total number of plates he already has, we add the green and red plates:
21 green plates + 28 red plates = 49 plates
4) To find out how many more plates he needs to buy, we subtract the number of plates he already has from the total number of plates he needs:
84 plates - 49 plates = 35 plates
Answer: 35
