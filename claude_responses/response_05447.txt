Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The water starts at 41 degrees.
2) The temperature increases by 3 degrees per minute.
3) To reach the boiling point of 212 degrees, the water needs to increase by 212 - 41 = 171 degrees.
4) To increase the temperature by 171 degrees, at a rate of 3 degrees per minute, it will take 171 / 3 = 57 minutes.
5) Once the water is boiling at 212 degrees, Jason needs to cook the pasta for 12 minutes.
6) After cooking the pasta, it will take Jason 1/3 of the time it took to cook the pasta to mix the pasta with the sauce and make a salad.
7) The time it took to cook the pasta is 12 minutes, so the time it takes to mix the pasta and make a salad is 12 / 3 = 4 minutes.
8) The total time it takes Jason to cook dinner is the time it takes to heat the water (57 minutes) plus the time it takes to cook the pasta (12 minutes) plus the time it takes to mix the pasta and make a salad (4 minutes).
Answer: 73 minutes.
