Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 300 senior students
* 5% of 300 students got a full merit college scholarship
* To calculate 5% of 300:
  - 5% = 0.05
  - 0.05 * 300 = 15 students got a full merit scholarship
* 10% of the 300 students got a half merit scholarship
* To calculate 10% of 300:
  - 10% = 0.10
  - 0.10 * 300 = 30 students got a half merit scholarship
* Now, to find how many senior students did not get any scholarships, we need to subtract the number of students who got scholarships from the total number of students:
  - Total students: 300
  - Students with full merit scholarship: 15
  - Students with half merit scholarship: 30
  - Students without any scholarship: 300 - 15 - 30 = 255

Answer: 255
