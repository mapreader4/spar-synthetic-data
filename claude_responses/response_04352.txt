Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. For the 20 tables, the cost of the linen tablecloths will be:
   * 20 tables x $25 per tablecloth = $500

2. For the place settings, each table needs 4 place settings at $10 each. So the total cost for the place settings will be:
   * 20 tables x 4 place settings x $10 per setting = $800

3. For the centerpieces, each centerpiece will have:
   * 10 roses at $5 each = $50
   * 15 lilies at $4 each = $60
   * Total cost per centerpiece = $50 + $60 = $110
   * With 20 tables, the total cost for the centerpieces will be:
     * 20 centerpieces x $110 per centerpiece = $2,200

4. To calculate the total cost of the decorations, we add up the costs from steps 1, 2, and 3:
   * $500 + $800 + $2,200 = $3,500

Answer: $3,500
