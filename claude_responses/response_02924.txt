Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Madeline has a total of 10 flowers
* 4 flowers are red
* 2 flowers are white
* The remaining flowers must be blue
* To find the number of blue flowers, we subtract the red and white flowers from the total:
    - Total flowers: 10
    - Red flowers: 4
    - White flowers: 2
    - Blue flowers: 10 - 4 - 2 = 4
* Now, to find the percentage of blue flowers, we divide the number of blue flowers by the total number of flowers and multiply by 100:
    - Percentage of blue flowers = (4 / 10) * 100 = 40%

Answer: 40
