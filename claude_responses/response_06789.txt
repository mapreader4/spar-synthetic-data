Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jebb's pay is $650.
2) He has to pay 10% in taxes.
3) To calculate the tax amount, we take 10% of $650:
   10% of $650 = 0.10 x $650 = $65
4) To calculate Jebb's take-home pay, we subtract the tax amount from his total pay:
   $650 - $65 = $585
Answer: $585
