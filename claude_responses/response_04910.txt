Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The school needs to cover 50 devices with virus protection software.
2) The $40 software package covers up to 5 devices, so the school would need 10 of these packages to cover all 50 devices.
3) The total cost of the $40 software packages would be 10 * $40 = $400.
4) The $60 software package covers up to 10 devices, so the school would need 5 of these packages to cover all 50 devices.
5) The total cost of the $60 software packages would be 5 * $60 = $300.
6) The difference between the two costs is $400 - $300 = $100.

Answer: $100
