Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 families of 4 people each, so that's 12 people total.
* Each person uses 1 oversized beach towel per day.
* The vacation rental was for 7 days.
* So the total number of oversized beach towels used is:
  * 12 people x 7 days = 84 oversized beach towels
* The washing machine can hold 14 oversized beach towels per load.
* To calculate the number of loads, we divide the total number of towels by the capacity of the washing machine:
  * 84 towels / 14 towels per load = 6 loads
