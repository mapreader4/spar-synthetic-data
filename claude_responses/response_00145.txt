Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy
* Each Jeopardy episode is 20 minutes long
* So the total time for Jeopardy is 2 episodes x 20 minutes = 40 minutes

* James also watched 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune
* Wheel of Fortune is twice as long as Jeopardy, so each episode is 40 minutes
* So the total time for Wheel of Fortune is 2 episodes x 40 minutes = 80 minutes

* To calculate the total time James spent watching TV, we add the time for Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune:
* 40 minutes + 80 minutes = 120 minutes

* To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
* 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours
