Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John's old apartment costs $1200 per month.
2) The new apartment is 40% more expensive than the old apartment.
   * 40% of $1200 is $480.
   * So the new apartment costs $1200 + $480 = $1680 per month.
3) Since John is splitting the cost with his two brothers, he only pays 1/3 of the $1680 per month.
   * 1/3 of $1680 is $560 per month.
4) To calculate the yearly savings, we need to compare the cost of John living alone in the old apartment ($1200 per month) to the cost of John splitting the new apartment ($560 per month).
   * Yearly cost of old apartment: $1200 x 12 = $14,400
   * Yearly cost of new apartment (split 3 ways): $560 x 12 = $6,720
5) The yearly savings is the difference between the two:
   * $14,400 - $6,720 = $7,680

Answer: $7,680
