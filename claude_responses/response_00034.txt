Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mr. Sam shared a certain amount of money between his two sons, Ken and Tony.
2) Ken got $1750.
3) Tony got twice as much as Ken, which means Tony got $1750 x 2 = $3500.
4) To find the total amount of money shared, we add the amounts given to Ken and Tony:
$1750 + $3500 = $5250.

Answer: $5250
