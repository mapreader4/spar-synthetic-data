Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Fifi has 7 pink hangers
* Fifi has 4 green hangers
* Fifi has one less blue hanger than there are green hangers
* Fifi has one less yellow hanger than there are blue hangers

First, let's calculate the number of blue hangers:
* Fifi has one less blue hanger than there are green hangers
* So, the number of blue hangers = 4 - 1 = 3

Next, let's calculate the number of yellow hangers:
* Fifi has one less yellow hanger than there are blue hangers
* So, the number of yellow hangers = 3 - 1 = 2

Now, we can calculate the total number of colored hangers in Fifi's closet:
* Total hangers = 7 pink + 4 green + 3 blue + 2 yellow
* Total hangers = 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16

Answer: 16
