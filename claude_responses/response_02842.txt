Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rachel solved 5 math problems each minute for 12 minutes before bed
* So, in the 12 minutes before bed, she solved 5 problems per minute x 12 minutes = 60 problems
* However, she didn't finish all of them, so we need to add the remaining 16 problems she solved the next day at lunch
* Therefore, the total number of math problems Rachel did is:
* 60 problems solved before bed + 16 problems solved the next day = 76 problems

Answer: 76
