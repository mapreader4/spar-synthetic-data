Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Let's define the variables:
  - Let M = number of Muscovy ducks
  - Let C = number of Cayuga ducks
  - Let K = number of Khaki Campbell ducks
* We are given the following information:
  - There are 4 more Muscovy ducks than Cayugas: M = C + 4
  - There are 3 more than twice as many Cayugas as Khaki Campbells: C = 2K + 3
  - There are 90 ducks total: M + C + K = 90
* Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:
  - (C + 4) + C + (2K + 3) = 90
  - 2C + 2K + 7 = 90
  - 2C + 2K = 83
  - C + K = 41.5
* Since the number of ducks must be an integer, we can conclude that C = 21 and K = 20.
* Substituting C = 21 into the first equation, we get:
  - M = 21 + 4 = 25
* Therefore, the number of Muscovy ducks is 25.

Answer: 25
