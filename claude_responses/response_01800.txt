Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Madeline got 2 mistakes
* Madeline's mistakes are half as many as Leo's mistakes
* Let's say Leo has x mistakes
* Since Madeline's mistakes are half as many as Leo's, Madeline has x/2 mistakes
* Brent scored 25 and has 1 more mistake than Leo
* So Brent has x+1 mistakes

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
* Brent's score = 25
* Brent's mistakes = x+1
* Therefore, Brent's correct answers = 25 - (x+1) = 24

Since Brent has 24 correct answers, and Madeline has x/2 mistakes, we can calculate Madeline's score:
* Madeline's score = 25 - x/2

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 23
