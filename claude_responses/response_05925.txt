Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* New York had 2000 confirmed cases
* California had half the number of cases as New York
* To find the number of cases in California:
    - New York had 2000 cases
    - California had half the number of cases as New York
    - So, California had 2000 / 2 = 1000 cases
* Texas had 400 fewer cases than California
* To find the number of cases in Texas:
    - California had 1000 cases
    - Texas had 400 fewer cases than California
    - So, Texas had 1000 - 400 = 600 cases
* To find the total number of cases in all three states:
    - New York had 2000 cases
    - California had 1000 cases
    - Texas had 600 cases
    - Total cases = 2000 + 1000 + 600 = 3600 cases

Answer: 3600
