Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that Carla's sheepdog rounded up 90% of her sheep.
2) This means that 90% of the total number of sheep are in the pen.
3) We are given that there are 81 sheep in the pen.
4) To find the total number of sheep, we need to divide 81 by 0.9 (since 90% is the same as 0.9).
5) 81 / 0.9 = 90 total sheep.
6) Since 90% of the sheep are in the pen, the remaining 10% must be out in the wilderness.
7) 10% of 90 sheep is 9 sheep.

Answer: 9
