Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joanne makes $16.00 per hour at her main job, and she works 8 hours per day.
2) So her daily earnings from her main job are:
   $16.00 per hour x 8 hours per day = $128.00 per day
3) Joanne also has a part-time job where she works an extra 2 hours per day and makes $13.50 per hour.
4) Her daily earnings from her part-time job are:
   $13.50 per hour x 2 hours per day = $27.00 per day
5) In total, her daily earnings are:
   $128.00 (main job) + $27.00 (part-time job) = $155.00 per day
6) She works this schedule 5 days a week.
7) So her weekly earnings are:
   $155.00 per day x 5 days per week = $775.00 per week

Answer: $775
