Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Ken started with a box on the scale, and added enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.
2) Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. So, if the weight was 2 pounds with just the jelly beans, and it tripled, the new weight would be 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.
3) Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So the new weight would be 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.
4) Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. So, if the weight was 8 pounds, and it doubled, the final weight would be 8 x 2 = 16 pounds.

Answer: 16 pounds
