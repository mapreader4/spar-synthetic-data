Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The company has 1000 employees initially.
* There will be three rounds of layoffs.
* For each round of layoff, 10% of the remaining employees will be laid off.

Let's calculate the number of employees laid off in each round:

Round 1:
* 10% of 1000 employees = 0.1 * 1000 = 100 employees laid off
* Remaining employees = 1000 - 100 = 900

Round 2:
* 10% of 900 employees = 0.1 * 900 = 90 employees laid off
* Remaining employees = 900 - 90 = 810

Round 3:
* 10% of 810 employees = 0.1 * 810 = 81 employees laid off
* Remaining employees = 810 - 81 = 729

Now, let's calculate the total number of employees laid off:
* Total employees laid off = 100 + 90 + 81 = 271

Answer: 271
