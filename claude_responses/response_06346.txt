Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill started reading the book on the first day of April
* He read 8 pages every day
* By the 12th of April, he had covered two-thirds of the book

First, let's calculate how many days it took Bill to read two-thirds of the book:
* From the 1st of April to the 12th of April is 12 days
* So, Bill read for 12 days

Next, let's calculate how many pages Bill read in those 12 days:
* He read 8 pages per day
* 8 pages per day x 12 days = 96 pages

Now, we know that the 96 pages Bill read is two-thirds of the total pages in the book. 
* So, the total pages in the book is 96 / (2/3) = 144 pages

Answer: 144
