Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that together, Alan and Marcy handed out 150 parking tickets.
2) We also know that Marcy handed out 6 fewer than 5 times as many tickets as Alan.
3) Let's let x be the number of tickets that Alan handed out.
4) Then, the number of tickets that Marcy handed out would be 5x - 6.
5) We know that the total number of tickets handed out is 150, so we can write the equation:
x + (5x - 6) = 150
6) Solving this equation, we get:
6x - 6 = 150
6x = 156
x = 26
7) Therefore, Alan handed out 26 tickets.

Answer: 26
