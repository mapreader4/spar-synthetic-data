Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jennifer's boyfriend left 5 texts about the grocery shopping.
2) He sent 5 times more texts asking why she wasn't responding. That means he sent 5 x 5 = 25 texts asking why she wasn't responding.
3) He sent a number of texts equal to 10% of all the texts he sent previously. 
4) The total number of texts he sent previously is 5 + 25 = 30.
5) 10% of 30 is 0.1 x 30 = 3.
6) Therefore, the total number of texts he sent is 5 + 25 + 3 = 33.

Answer: 33
