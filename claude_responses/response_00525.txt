Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carla needs to drive 8 miles to the grocery store.
2) Then she needs to drive 6 miles to pick up her kids from school.
3) Next, she needs to drive 12 miles to drop her kids off at soccer practice.
4) Finally, she needs to drive twice the distance from the school to soccer practice to get everyone home again. That's 2 * 12 = 24 miles.
5) So the total distance Carla needs to drive is 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 miles.
6) Carla's car gets 25 miles per gallon, so to calculate the amount of gas she needs, we divide the total distance by 25:
50 miles / 25 miles per gallon = 2 gallons of gas.
7) Gas costs $2.50 per gallon, so the total cost of gas for Carla's trip will be:
2 gallons * $2.50 per gallon = $5.00.

Answer: $5.00.
