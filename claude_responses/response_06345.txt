Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Karen has 6 ferns around her house
* Each fern has 7 fronds
* Each frond has 30 leaves

To find the total number of leaves, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of leaves per fern
2. Multiply the number of leaves per fern by the total number of ferns

First, let's find the number of leaves per fern:
* Each fern has 7 fronds
* Each frond has 30 leaves
* So, each fern has 7 x 30 = 210 leaves

Now, let's find the total number of leaves across all 6 ferns:
* Each fern has 210 leaves
* There are 6 ferns
* So, the total number of leaves is 6 x 210 = 1,260

Answer: 1,260
