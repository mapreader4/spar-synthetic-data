Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Thomas originally ordered 3 dozen chairs for 3 dozen guests. 3 dozen is 36 chairs.
2) Then, 1/3 of the guests want to bring a guest of their own. 1/3 of 36 guests is 12 additional guests.
3) So Thomas needs to order 12 more chairs for the additional guests.
4) However, 5 of the original 36 guests can't make it, so Thomas doesn't need chairs for those 5 guests.
5) Finally, Thomas wants to order 12 extra chairs just in case they need them.

Putting it all together:
* Original 36 chairs
* Plus 12 chairs for additional guests
* Minus 5 chairs for guests who can't make it
* Plus 12 extra chairs
* Total chairs ordered = 36 + 12 - 5 + 12 = 55 chairs

Answer: 55
