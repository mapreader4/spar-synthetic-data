Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mira jogs 5 miles per hour
* She jogs for 2 hours every morning
* We want to know how many miles she can jog for five days

First, let's calculate how many miles she can jog in one day:
* Mira jogs 5 miles per hour
* She jogs for 2 hours every morning
* So, in one day she can jog 5 miles per hour x 2 hours = 10 miles

Now, let's calculate how many miles she can jog for five days:
* In one day she can jog 10 miles
* For five days, she can jog 10 miles x 5 days = 50 miles

Answer: 50 miles
