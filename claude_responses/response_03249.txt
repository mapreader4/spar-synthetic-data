Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) A pound of strawberries costs $2.20.
2) A pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as a pound of strawberries.
   * So, the cost of a pound of cherries is 6 x $2.20 = $13.20.
3) Briget will buy 5 pounds of strawberries and 5 pounds of cherries.
   * The cost of 5 pounds of strawberries is 5 x $2.20 = $11.00.
   * The cost of 5 pounds of cherries is 5 x $13.20 = $66.00.
4) The total cost is the sum of the cost of the strawberries and the cost of the cherries.
   * Total cost = $11.00 + $66.00 = $77.00.

Answer: $77.
