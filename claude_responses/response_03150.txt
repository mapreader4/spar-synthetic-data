Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Percy needs to save up $500 for the new PlayStation
* He gets $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas, so that's a total of $350 he has already
* To make the rest of the money, he needs to sell his old PlayStation games for $7.5 each
* So, the amount he still needs to make is $500 - $350 = $150
* To make $150 by selling games at $7.5 each, he needs to sell $150 / $7.5 = 20 games

Answer: 20 games
