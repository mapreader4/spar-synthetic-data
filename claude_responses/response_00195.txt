Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary bought 5 boxes of drinks at $6 each box. So the total cost of the drinks is:
5 boxes x $6 per box = $30
2) Mary bought 10 boxes of pizzas at $14 each box. So the total cost of the pizzas is:
10 boxes x $14 per box = $140
3) The total cost of all the items is the sum of the drinks and pizzas:
$30 + $140 = $170
4) Mary paid $200 for all the items.
5) To calculate the change she received, we take the amount she paid ($200) and subtract the total cost ($170):
$200 - $170 = $30

Answer: 30
