Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 50 goldfish in the pond.
2) Each goldfish eats 1.5 ounces of food per day.
3) 20% of the goldfish need to eat special food that costs $3 an ounce.
4) To calculate the number of goldfish that need special food, we take 20% of 50 goldfish:
   * 20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 goldfish
5) The amount of special food needed per day is 10 goldfish * 1.5 ounces per goldfish = 15 ounces per day.
6) The cost of the special food per day is 15 ounces * $3 per ounce = $45 per day.

Answer: $45
