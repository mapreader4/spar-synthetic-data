Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Missy had a giant piggy bank in her bedroom
* Every day, she would search the house for change to put in her bank
* After 4 years, the bank was opened and it contained $450 in change
* The second, third, and fourth-year, she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the previous year

Let's call the amount of money she put in the bank in the first year "x".

In the second year, she put in 2x.
In the third year, she put in 2(2x) = 4x.
In the fourth year, she put in 2(4x) = 8x.

The total amount of money in the bank after 4 years is the sum of these amounts:
x + 2x + 4x + 8x = 15x = $450

Solving for x, we get:
x = $450 / 15 = $30

Therefore, Missy put $30 in the bank the first year.

Answer: $30
