Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* One ticket to the underground costs $3
* In one minute, the metro sells an average of 5 such tickets
* We want to find the earnings from the tickets in 6 minutes

To calculate the earnings in 6 minutes, we need to:
1. Calculate the earnings in 1 minute
2. Multiply the earnings in 1 minute by 6 to get the earnings in 6 minutes

Earnings in 1 minute:
* 5 tickets sold per minute
* Each ticket costs $3
* Earnings per minute = 5 tickets x $3 per ticket = $15

Earnings in 6 minutes:
* Earnings per minute = $15
* Earnings in 6 minutes = $15 x 6 = $90

Answer: $90
