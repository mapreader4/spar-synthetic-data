Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ellie's brother's first throw skipped an unknown number of times
* His second throw skipped 2 more times than the first throw
* His third throw skipped twice as many times as the second throw
* His fourth throw skipped 3 fewer times than the third throw
* His fifth throw skipped 1 more time than the fourth throw, and it skipped 8 times

Let's start with the fifth throw, which skipped 8 times.
* The fourth throw skipped 8 - 1 = 7 times
* The third throw skipped 7 + 3 = 10 times
* The second throw skipped 10 / 2 = 5 times
* The first throw skipped 5 - 2 = 3 times

Now we can add up the total number of skips across all 5 throws:
* 3 + 5 + 10 + 7 + 8 = 33 skips

Answer: 33
