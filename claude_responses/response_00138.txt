Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The normal price of a gallon of whole milk is $3.
2) The discounted price of a gallon of whole milk is $2.
3) The normal price of a box of cereal is unknown, but we know it was discounted by $1.
4) You are buying 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.
5) To calculate the savings on the milk, we take the normal price ($3) and subtract the discounted price ($2), which gives us a savings of $1 per gallon.
6) With 3 gallons of milk, the total savings on the milk is 3 x $1 = $3.
7) For the cereal, we know the discount was $1 per box.
8) With 5 boxes of cereal, the total savings on the cereal is 5 x $1 = $5.
9) The total savings from the discounts is the sum of the savings on the milk and the savings on the cereal: $3 + $5 = $8.
