Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 rooms with 4 walls each, so that's 5 * 4 = 20 walls
* There are 4 rooms with 5 walls each, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 walls
* In total, there are 20 + 20 = 40 walls in the house
* There are 5 people in Amanda's family
* To divide the work evenly, we need to divide the total number of walls (40) by the number of people (5)
* 40 / 5 = 8
