Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John has 15 snakes.
2) He has twice as many monkeys as he does snakes. So, he has 2 x 15 = 30 monkeys.
3) He has 5 fewer lions than he does monkeys. So, he has 30 - 5 = 25 lions.
4) He has 8 more pandas than he does lions. So, he has 25 + 8 = 33 pandas.
5) He has 1/3 as many dogs as he does pandas. So, he has 33 / 3 = 11 dogs.

Adding up all the animals:
15 snakes + 30 monkeys + 25 lions + 33 pandas + 11 dogs = 114 total animals.

Answer: 114
