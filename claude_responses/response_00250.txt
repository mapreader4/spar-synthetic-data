Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom uses 10 weight plates, each weighing 30 pounds
* The total weight of the plates is 10 x 30 = 300 pounds
* The exercise machine uses special technology to make the weights 20% heavier on the lowering portion
* To calculate the 20% increase:
    - 20% of 300 pounds = 0.2 x 300 = 60 pounds
* So the weights felt 60 pounds heavier when being lowered
* Therefore, the weights felt 300 + 60 = 360 pounds when being lowered

Answer: 360 pounds
