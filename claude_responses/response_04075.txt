Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20 years.
2) Hurley is currently 14 years old.
3) Therefore, Richard is currently 14 + 20 = 34 years old.
4) In 40 years, Hurley will be 14 + 40 = 54 years old.
5) In 40 years, Richard will be 34 + 40 = 74 years old.
6) The combined ages of Richard and Hurley 40 years from now will be 54 + 74 = 128.

Answer: 128
