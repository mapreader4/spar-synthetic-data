Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The original price of the bedside lamp is $120.
2) The department store is offering a 20% discount on all fixtures.
3) To calculate the new price, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original price.
4) The discount amount is 20% of $120, which is 0.20 x $120 = $24.
5) Subtracting the discount amount of $24 from the original price of $120, we get the new price of $120 - $24 = $96.

Answer: 96
