Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 Grade 4 sections participating in the recycling drive
* Each section collected 280 kilos of newspapers in the first two weeks
* To calculate the total amount collected in the first two weeks:
    - 6 sections x 280 kilos per section = 1,680 kilos
* After the third week, they found they need 320 kilos more to reach their target
* To calculate the target amount:
    - Amount collected in first two weeks (1,680 kilos) + 320 kilos needed = Target amount

Answer: 2,000 kilos
