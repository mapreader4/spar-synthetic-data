Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Yvonne wrote 400 words
2) Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne, so Janna wrote 400 + 150 = 550 words
3) The total number of words written by Yvonne and Janna is 400 + 550 = 950 words
4) They removed 20 words from the paper
5) They added twice as many words as they removed, so they added 2 * 20 = 40 words
6) The total number of words in the paper after editing is 950 - 20 + 40 = 970 words
7) The research paper requirement is 1000 words
8) Therefore, they should add 1000 - 970 = 30 more words to reach the research paper requirement.
