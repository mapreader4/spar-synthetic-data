Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lola baked:
  - 13 mini cupcakes
  - 10 pop tarts
  - 8 blueberry pies
* Lulu made:
  - 16 mini cupcakes
  - 12 pop tarts
  - 14 blueberry pies
* To find the total number of pastries made by Lola and Lulu, we need to add up all the individual items:
  - Lola's mini cupcakes: 13
  - Lola's pop tarts: 10
  - Lola's blueberry pies: 8
  - Lulu's mini cupcakes: 16
  - Lulu's pop tarts: 12
  - Lulu's blueberry pies: 14
* Adding these up, we get:
  - 13 + 10 + 8 + 16 + 12 + 14 = 73
Answer: 73
