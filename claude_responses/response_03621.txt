Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Fiona worked 40 hours per week
* John worked 30 hours per week
* Jeremy worked 25 hours per week
* All employees are paid $20 per hour

To calculate the total amount the boss spends paying all of them every month, we need to:
1. Calculate the weekly pay for each employee:
   * Fiona's weekly pay: 40 hours x $20 per hour = $800
   * John's weekly pay: 30 hours x $20 per hour = $600
   * Jeremy's weekly pay: 25 hours x $20 per hour = $500
2. Add up the weekly pay for all three employees to get the total weekly pay:
   * $800 + $600 + $500 = $1,900
3. Multiply the total weekly pay by 4 to get the monthly pay:
   * $1,900 x 4 = $7,600

Answer: $7,600
