Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Elizabeth uses $3.00 worth of ingredients to make 1 bag of granola.
2) She makes 20 bags in total.
3) She sells the first 15 bags for $6.00 each.
   * Revenue from selling 15 bags at $6.00 each: 15 x $6.00 = $90.00
4) She sells the remaining 5 bags for $4.00 each.
   * Revenue from selling 5 bags at $4.00 each: 5 x $4.00 = $20.00
5) Total revenue: $90.00 + $20.00 = $110.00
6) Total cost of ingredients for 20 bags: 20 x $3.00 = $60.00
7) Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of ingredients
   * Net profit = $110.00 - $60.00 = $50.00

Answer: $50
