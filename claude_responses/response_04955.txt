Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The daily salary of the manager is $5
* The daily salary of the clerk is $2
* There are 2 managers currently employed
* There are 3 clerks currently employed

To calculate the total daily salary of all the employees, we need to:
1. Calculate the total daily salary of the managers
   * 2 managers x $5 per manager = $10 total daily salary for managers
2. Calculate the total daily salary of the clerks
   * 3 clerks x $2 per clerk = $6 total daily salary for clerks
3. Add the total daily salaries of the managers and clerks together
   * $10 + $6 = $16 total daily salary for all employees
