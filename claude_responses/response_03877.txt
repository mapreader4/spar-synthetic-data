Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marissa has 4.5 feet of ribbon
2) She uses 0.7 feet of ribbon to tie each box
3) 1 foot of ribbon is left after she ties each box
4) To find the number of boxes she tied, we need to calculate how many times she can use 0.7 feet of ribbon before running out of ribbon
5) The total amount of ribbon used is 4.5 feet - 1 foot = 3.5 feet
6) Since she uses 0.7 feet of ribbon per box, we can divide the total amount of ribbon used (3.5 feet) by the amount of ribbon used per box (0.7 feet)
7) 3.5 feet / 0.7 feet per box = 5 boxes
