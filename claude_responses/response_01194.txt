Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Vincent starts with 72 inches of rope.
2) He cuts the rope into 12 equal length pieces. Since 72 inches divided by 12 pieces is 6 inches per piece, each piece is 6 inches long.
3) Vincent then ties three pieces together. This means he has 4 sets of 3 pieces each, for a total of 12 pieces.
4) The knots make each piece 1 inch shorter. So each piece is now 5 inches long.
5) Therefore, the final length of each piece of rope is 5 inches.

Answer: 5 inches
