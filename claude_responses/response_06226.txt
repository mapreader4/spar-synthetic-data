Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Theo makes 3 egg and 4 egg omelettes
* The cafe is open from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., which is 4 hours
* In the first hour, 5 customers order the 3 egg omelettes, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 eggs
* In the second hour, 7 customers order the 4 egg omelettes, so that's 7 * 4 = 28 eggs
* In the third hour, 3 customers order the 3 egg omelettes, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs
* In the last hour, 8 customers order the 4 egg omelettes, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 eggs
* To calculate the total number of eggs needed, we add up the eggs for each hour:
15 + 28 + 9 + 32 = 84 eggs

Answer: 84
