Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Phillip's mother gave him $95 to go to the supermarket
* He spent:
    - $14 on oranges
    - $25 on apples
    - $6 on candy
* To calculate the amount of money he has left, we need to subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he was given.
* Total amount spent:
    - $14 + $25 + $6 = $45
* Amount of money left:
    - $95 - $45 = $50
