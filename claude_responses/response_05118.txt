Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, 14 marigolds were sold.
* On the second day, 25 more marigolds were sold.
* On the third day, the center sold two times the number of marigolds it did on the second day.
* To calculate the number of marigolds sold on the third day:
  - On the second day, 25 marigolds were sold.
  - Two times that number is 2 * 25 = 50 marigolds sold on the third day.
* Now we can add up the total number of marigolds sold during the sale:
  - First day: 14 marigolds
  - Second day: 25 marigolds
  - Third day: 50 marigolds
  - Total: 14 + 25 + 50 = 89 marigolds

Answer: 89
