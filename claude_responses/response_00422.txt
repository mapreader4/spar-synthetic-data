Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bryan works 8 hours a day
* He spends 4 hours on customer outreach posts
* He spends half the time on customer outreach posts on advertisement posts, which is 2 hours
* So, the total time spent on customer outreach posts and advertisement posts is 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours
* Since Bryan works 8 hours a day, the remaining time he spends on marketing posts is 8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
