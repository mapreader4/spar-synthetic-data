Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The smartphone costs $160.
2) Lyka has $40 at the moment.
3) She needs to save the remaining amount, which is $160 - $40 = $120.
4) She plans to save for two months, which is 8 weeks (2 months x 4 weeks per month).
5) To find the amount she needs to save per week, we divide the remaining amount ($120) by the number of weeks (8).
6) $120 / 8 = $15 per week.
