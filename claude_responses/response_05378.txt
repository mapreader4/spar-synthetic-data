Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The building has 20 stories total.
2) The first 10 stories are each 12 feet tall.
3) The remaining 10 stories are each 3 feet taller than the first 10 stories, which means they are 15 feet tall each.
4) To calculate the total height of the building, we need to add the heights of the first 10 stories and the remaining 10 stories.
5) The height of the first 10 stories is 10 * 12 = 120 feet.
6) The height of the remaining 10 stories is 10 * 15 = 150 feet.
7) The total height of the building is 120 feet + 150 feet = 270 feet.

Answer: 270
