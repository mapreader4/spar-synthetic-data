Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Santana has 7 brothers
* 3 of them have birthdays in March (first half of the year)
* 1 of them has a birthday in October (second half of the year)
* 1 of them has a birthday in November (second half of the year)
* 2 of them have birthdays in December (second half of the year)

For the first half of the year (January to June):
* Santana buys 3 birthday presents (one for each brother with a March birthday)
* Santana buys 7 Christmas presents (one for each brother)
* Total presents in the first half of the year: 3 + 7 = 10

For the second half of the year (July to December):
* Santana buys 3 birthday presents (one for each brother with an October, November, and December birthday)
* Santana buys 7 Christmas presents (one for each brother)
* Total presents in the second half of the year: 3 + 7 = 10

The difference between the number of presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year and the first half of the year is:
* 10 - 10 = 0

Answer: 0
