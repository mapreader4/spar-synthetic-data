Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dennis collected 10 rocks.
2) He put all 10 rocks in his aquarium.
3) His fish ate half of the rocks. Since he had 10 rocks, half of 10 is 5. So, the fish ate 5 rocks.
4) Dennis was able to make the fish spit out 2 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the number of rocks left:
* Dennis started with 10 rocks.
* The fish ate 5 rocks.
* Dennis was able to get 2 rocks back.
* So, the number of rocks left is: 10 - 5 + 2 = 7 rocks.

Answer: 7
