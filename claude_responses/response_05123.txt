Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Olivia bought 2 packs of basketball cards at $3 each. So the total cost of the basketball cards is 2 x $3 = $6.
2) Olivia also bought 5 decks of baseball cards at $4 each. So the total cost of the baseball cards is 5 x $4 = $20.
3) The total cost of all the cards is $6 + $20 = $26.
4) Olivia had a $50 bill, so the amount of change she received is $50 - $26 = $24.
