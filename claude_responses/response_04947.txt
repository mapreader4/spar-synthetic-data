Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony bought 3 lottery tickets
* He chose the same numbers on each ticket
* 5 of the numbers on each ticket are winning numbers
* Each winning number is worth $20

To calculate the total amount of money Tony has won, we need to:
1. Calculate the total value of the winning numbers on each ticket
2. Multiply that value by the number of tickets he bought

Step 1: Calculate the total value of the winning numbers on each ticket
* Each winning number is worth $20
* There are 5 winning numbers on each ticket
* So the total value of the winning numbers on each ticket is: 5 x $20 = $100

Step 2: Multiply the total value per ticket by the number of tickets he bought
* Tony bought 3 tickets
* The total value of the winning numbers on each ticket is $100
* So the total amount of money Tony has won is: 3 x $100 = $300

Answer: $300
