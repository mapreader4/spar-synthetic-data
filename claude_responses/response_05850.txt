Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total number of employees in the company is 450.
* Each employee earns $2000 per month.
* The company laid off 1/3 of its employees.

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the remaining employees, we need to:
1. Calculate how many employees were laid off:
   * 1/3 of 450 employees = 450 * 1/3 = 150 employees laid off
2. Calculate how many employees remained:
   * 450 - 150 = 300 employees remaining
3. Calculate the total amount paid to the remaining employees:
   * 300 employees * $2000 per month = $600,000 per month

Answer: $600,000
