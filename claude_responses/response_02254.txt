Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Aubrey starts with a deck of 52 cards.
2) She then adds 2 additional cards to the deck, so the total number of cards is now 52 + 2 = 54.
3) Aubrey is splitting the deck evenly among herself and two other players.
4) To find the number of cards each player has, we divide the total number of cards (54) by the number of players (3).
5) 54 รท 3 = 18.

Answer: 18
