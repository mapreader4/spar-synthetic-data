Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Raul had $87 to spare.
2) Raul bought 8 comics, each costing $4.
3) To calculate the total cost of the 8 comics, we multiply the number of comics (8) by the cost of each comic ($4):
   8 comics x $4 per comic = $32 total cost
4) Now, to calculate how much money Raul has left, we take the amount he had to spare ($87) and subtract the total cost of the comics ($32):
   $87 - $32 = $55
Answer: $55
