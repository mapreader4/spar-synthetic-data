Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bird feeder holds 2 cups of birdseed
* Each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds
* The squirrel steals 1/2 cup of birdseed every week
* So, the amount of birdseed available to the birds each week is:
    - 2 cups - 1/2 cup (stolen by the squirrel) = 1.5 cups
* Now, we can calculate the number of birds that can be fed with 1.5 cups of birdseed:
    - 1.5 cups x 14 birds/cup = 21 birds

Answer: 21 birds
