Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jayda spent $400 at the market.
2) Aitana spent 2/5 times more money than Jayda.
3) To calculate how much Aitana spent, we take Jayda's amount ($400) and add 2/5 of that amount:
   * 2/5 of $400 = $160
   * Aitana's total spending = $400 + $160 = $560
4) To calculate the total amount of money they spent together, we add Jayda's spending and Aitana's spending:
   * Total amount spent = $400 + $560 = $960

Answer: $960
