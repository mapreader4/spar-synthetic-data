Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total water needed for Farmer Bob's farm:
   * Corn: 3 acres x 20 gallons/acre = 60 gallons
   * Cotton: 9 acres x 80 gallons/acre = 720 gallons
   * Beans: 12 acres x (2 x 20 gallons/acre) = 480 gallons
   * Total for Farmer Bob: 60 + 720 + 480 = 1,260 gallons

2. Calculate the total water needed for Farmer Brenda's farm:
   * Corn: 6 acres x 20 gallons/acre = 120 gallons
   * Cotton: 7 acres x 80 gallons/acre = 560 gallons
   * Beans: 14 acres x (2 x 20 gallons/acre) = 560 gallons
   * Total for Farmer Brenda: 120 + 560 + 560 = 1,240 gallons

3. Calculate the total water needed for Farmer Bernie's farm:
   * Corn: 2 acres x 20 gallons/acre = 40 gallons
   * Cotton: 12 acres x 80 gallons/acre = 960 gallons
   * Beans: 0 acres (not mentioned), so 0 gallons
   * Total for Farmer Bernie: 40 + 960 + 0 = 1,000 gallons

4. Calculate the total water needed for all three farms:
   * Total water needed = 1,260 + 1,240 + 1,000 = 3,500 gallons

5. Calculate the percentage of total water used by Farmer Bob's farm:
   * Percentage = (Farmer Bob's water usage / Total water usage) x 100
   * Percentage = (1,260 / 3,500) x 100 = 36%

Answer: 36%
