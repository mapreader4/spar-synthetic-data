Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Tony has a piece of quilt that is 6 feet by 24 feet.
2) He wants to turn it into a square and use all the fabric.
3) The area of the original quilt is 6 feet x 24 feet = 144 square feet.
4) The area of a square is given by the formula: Area = side length x side length.
5) Since he wants to use all the fabric, the area of the square must be equal to the area of the original quilt, which is 144 square feet.
6) Therefore, we can set up the equation: side length x side length = 144 square feet.
7) Solving for the side length, we get: side length = âˆš144 = 12 feet.

Answer: 12 feet
