Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 15 students in the art club
* Each student makes 2 artworks by the end of each quarter
* There are 4 quarters in a school year
* We need to calculate the number of artworks collected in two school years

First, let's calculate the number of artworks collected in one school year:
* Each student makes 2 artworks per quarter
* There are 4 quarters in a school year
* So each student makes 2 x 4 = 8 artworks in one school year
* With 15 students, the total number of artworks collected in one school year is 15 x 8 = 120 artworks

Now, to calculate the number of artworks collected in two school years:
* In two school years, the total number of artworks collected is 2 x 120 = 240 artworks

Answer: 240
