Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There are 8 men with an average weight of 190 pounds.
2) To find the total weight of the 8 men, we multiply the average weight (190 pounds) by the number of men (8):
   8 men x 190 pounds = 1,520 pounds
3) There are 6 women with an average weight of 120 pounds.
4) To find the total weight of the 6 women, we multiply the average weight (120 pounds) by the number of women (6):
   6 women x 120 pounds = 720 pounds
5) To find the total weight of all 14 men and women, we add the total weight of the men (1,520 pounds) and the total weight of the women (720 pounds):
   1,520 pounds + 720 pounds = 2,240 pounds
6) To find the average weight of all 14 men and women, we divide the total weight (2,240 pounds) by the total number of people (14):
   2,240 pounds / 14 people = 160 pounds

Answer: 160
