Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 25 peaches in each basket
* 5 baskets of peaches were delivered to the market
* So the total number of peaches delivered is:
  * 5 baskets x 25 peaches per basket = 125 peaches
* The farmers have eaten 5 peaches
* So the remaining number of peaches is:
  * 125 peaches - 5 peaches = 120 peaches
* The remaining peaches are packed into smaller boxes of 15 each
* To calculate the number of boxes, we divide the remaining peaches by the number of peaches per box:
  * 120 peaches / 15 peaches per box = 8 boxes

Answer: 8
