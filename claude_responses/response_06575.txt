Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each raised bed is 2 feet high, 2 feet wide, and 8 feet long
* The sides of each bed will be made of 1-foot wide planks
* Bob needs to construct 10 raised beds
* For each bed, he will need:
    - 2 planks that are 8 feet long (for the long sides)
    - 4 planks that are 2 feet long (for the short sides)
* So for each bed, he will need 6 planks total
* For 10 beds, he will need 10 * 6 = 60 planks
* Since the boards are 8 feet long, Bob will need to buy 60 / 1 = 60 boards that are 8 feet long.

Answer: 60
