Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jim's bi-weekly gross pay is $1120.
2) He automatically has 25% of his paycheck go into his retirement account.
   * 25% of $1120 = 0.25 * $1120 = $280
3) They also take $100.00 out of each paycheck for taxes.
4) To calculate the net pay, we take the gross pay and subtract the retirement contribution and the taxes:
   * Net pay = Gross pay - Retirement contribution - Taxes
   * Net pay = $1120 - $280 - $100 = $740

Answer: $740
