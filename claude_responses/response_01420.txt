Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carla drank 3 times as much soda as water, minus 6 ounces
* Let's call the amount of water she drank "x" ounces
* Then the amount of soda she drank would be 3x - 6 ounces
* The total amount of liquid she drank is 54 ounces
* So we can write the equation: x + (3x - 6) = 54
* Solving for x:
* x + 3x - 6 = 54
* 4x - 6 = 54
* 4x = 60
* x = 15

Answer: 15 ounces
