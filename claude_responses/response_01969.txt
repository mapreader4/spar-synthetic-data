Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Stacy has 32 berries
* Steve takes 4 of Stacy's berries
* After taking the 4 berries, Steve still has 7 less berries than Stacy started with

So, we can calculate the number of berries Steve started with:
* Stacy started with 32 berries
* Steve took 4 berries from Stacy
* So, Stacy now has 32 - 4 = 28 berries
* Steve has 7 less berries than Stacy started with, which is 32 - 7 = 25 berries

Therefore, Steve started with 25 berries.

Answer: 25
