Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Meghan needs 2 drip coffees at $2.25 each, so that's 2 x $2.25 = $4.50
* She needs 1 double shot espresso at $3.50
* She needs 2 lattes at $4.00 each, so that's 2 x $4.00 = $8.00
* She needs to add vanilla syrup to one of the lattes, which is an additional $0.50
* She needs 2 cold brew coffees at $2.50 each, so that's 2 x $2.50 = $5.00
* She needs 1 cappuccino at $3.50

Now, let's add up all the costs:
* $4.50 + $3.50 + $8.00 + $0.50 + $5.00 + $3.50 = $25.00

Answer: $25
