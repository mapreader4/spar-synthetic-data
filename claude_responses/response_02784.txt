Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Rubble has $15 in his pocket.
2) He needs to buy 2 notebooks and 2 pens.
3) Each notebook costs $4.00, so 2 notebooks will cost 2 x $4.00 = $8.00.
4) Each pen costs $1.50, so 2 pens will cost 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.
5) The total cost of the 2 notebooks and 2 pens is $8.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.
6) Rubble had $15 in his pocket, and he spent $11.00, so the amount of money left from Rubble after the purchase is $15 - $11.00 = $4.00.
