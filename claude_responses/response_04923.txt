Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The building has 9 floors
* Jake uses the stairs, descending 3 steps every second
* The stairs have 30 steps across each floor
* The elevator takes 1 minute (60 seconds) to get to ground level

First, let's calculate how long it will take Jake to get to the ground floor using the stairs:
* There are 9 floors, with 30 steps per floor
* So, Jake has to descend 9 * 30 = 270 steps
* He descends 3 steps per second
* Therefore, it will take him 270 / 3 = 90 seconds to get to the ground floor

Now, let's calculate how long it will take the elevator to get to the ground floor:
* The elevator takes 1 minute (60 seconds) to get to the ground floor

Finally, to find the difference in time between when Jake and Austin reach the ground floor:
* Jake takes 90 seconds to reach the ground floor
* Austin takes 60 seconds to reach the ground floor
* Therefore, Jake reaches the ground floor 90 - 60 = 30 seconds later than Austin

Answer: 30
