Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mairead runs for 40 miles
2) She then walks for 3/5 times as many miles as she ran
   - 3/5 of 40 miles = 24 miles
3) She then walks for five times the number of miles she jogged
   - She jogged 40 miles
   - 5 times 40 miles = 200 miles
4) To calculate the total distance Mairead has covered, we add up the running and walking distances:
   - 40 miles (running) + 24 miles (walking 3/5 of running) + 200 miles (walking 5 times jogging)
   = 40 + 24 + 200
   = 264 miles

Answer: 264
