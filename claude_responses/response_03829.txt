Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tina's bag initially contains:
   - 9 apples
   - 5 oranges
   - 17 tangerines
2) Tina takes away:
   - 2 oranges
   - 10 tangerines
3) After taking away the items, Tina has:
   - 9 apples (no change)
   - 5 - 2 = 3 oranges
   - 17 - 10 = 7 tangerines
4) The difference between the number of tangerines and oranges Tina has left is:
   - 7 tangerines - 3 oranges = 4 more tangerines than oranges
