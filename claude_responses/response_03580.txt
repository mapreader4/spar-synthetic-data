Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, Remi planted 200 seedlings
* On the second day, Remi planted twice the number of seedlings he planted on the first day, which is 2 x 200 = 400 seedlings
* The total number of seedlings transferred to the farm on these two days was 1200
* To find the number of seedlings his father planted, we need to subtract the number of seedlings Remi planted from the total:
* Total seedlings planted = 1200
* Seedlings planted by Remi = 200 + 400 = 600
* Seedlings planted by his father = 1200 - 600 = 600

Answer: 600
