Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Stephen made 10 round trips up and down the mountain
* Each round trip involves going up the mountain and then back down
* The mountain is 40,000 feet tall
* On each trip, he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height

To calculate the total distance covered:
* On each trip up, he covers 3/4 of the 40,000 feet, which is 30,000 feet
* On each trip down, he covers the remaining 1/4 of the 40,000 feet, which is 10,000 feet
* So each round trip covers a total of 30,000 + 10,000 = 40,000 feet
* He made 10 round trips, so the total distance covered is:
* 10 round trips x 40,000 feet per round trip = 400,000 feet

Answer: 400,000
