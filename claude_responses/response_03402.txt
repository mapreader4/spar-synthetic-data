Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Normal price of a movie ticket: $8
* Normal price of a bucket of popcorn: $8 - $3 = $5
* Normal price of a drink: $5 + $1 = $6
* Normal price of a candy: $6 / 2 = $3
* Total normal price of a ticket, popcorn, drink, and candy: $8 + $5 + $6 + $3 = $22
* The deal price for a ticket, popcorn, drink, and candy is $20
* The deal saves the customer: $22 - $20 = $2

Answer: $2
