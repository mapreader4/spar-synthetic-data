Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The original size of the bathroom is 96 sq ft.
2) The width of the bathroom is 8 feet.
3) The owner wants to extend the bathroom by 2 feet on each side.
4) To find the new area, we need to calculate the new width and length of the bathroom.
5) The new width will be 8 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet = 12 feet.
6) The length of the bathroom can be calculated by dividing the original area (96 sq ft) by the original width (8 feet), which gives us 12 feet.
7) The new length will also be 12 feet.
8) The new area of the bathroom will be the new width (12 feet) multiplied by the new length (12 feet), which is 144 sq ft.
