Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* This month, the carpenter made 10 tables
* Last month, he made 3 fewer tables than this month
* To find the number of tables he made last month, we subtract 3 from the 10 tables he made this month:
* 10 tables - 3 tables = 7 tables
* Now, to find the total number of tables the carpenter made, we add the 10 tables from this month and the 7 tables from last month:
* 10 tables + 7 tables = 17 tables

Answer: 17
