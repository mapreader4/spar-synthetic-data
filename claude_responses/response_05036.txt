Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marlon had 42 lollipops in the beginning.
2) He gave Emily 2/3 of his lollipops. To calculate 2/3 of 42, we multiply 42 by 2/3: 42 * 2/3 = 28 lollipops.
3) After giving Emily 28 lollipops, Marlon had 42 - 28 = 14 lollipops left.
4) Marlon kept 4 lollipops for himself.
5) He then gave the remaining lollipops to Lou. The remaining lollipops were 14 - 4 = 10 lollipops.

Answer: 10 lollipops.
