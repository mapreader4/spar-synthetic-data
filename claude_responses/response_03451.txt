Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Green beans weigh 60 kg.
2. Sugar weighs 10 kg less than green beans, so sugar weighs 50 kg.
3. Rice weighs 30 kg less than green beans, so rice weighs 30 kg.
4. During the accident, 1/3 of the rice weight was lost, so the remaining rice weight is 30 kg - (1/3 * 30 kg) = 20 kg.
5. During the accident, 1/5 of the sugar weight was lost, so the remaining sugar weight is 50 kg - (1/5 * 50 kg) = 40 kg.
6. The remaining stock weight is the sum of the remaining weights of rice, sugar, and green beans:
   Remaining stock weight = 20 kg + 40 kg + 60 kg = 120 kg.

Answer: 120 kg.
