Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The cheetah can run at a top speed of 60 mph.
2) The gazelle can run at a top speed of 40 mph.
3) 1 mile per hour is approximately 1.5 feet per second.
4) The cheetah and the gazelle are initially 210 feet apart and are both running in the same direction.
5) To find the time it takes for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we need to find the relative speed between the two animals.
6) The cheetah's speed is 60 mph, which is 60 * 1.5 = 90 feet per second.
7) The gazelle's speed is 40 mph, which is 40 * 1.5 = 60 feet per second.
8) The relative speed between the cheetah and the gazelle is 90 - 60 = 30 feet per second.
9) The time it takes for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle is the distance between them (210 feet) divided by their relative speed (30 feet per second).
10) 210 feet / 30 feet per second = 7 seconds.

Answer: 7 seconds.
