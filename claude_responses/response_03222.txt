Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nicole collected 400 Pokemon cards.
2) Cindy collected twice as many as Nicole, so Cindy collected 2 * 400 = 800 cards.
3) The combined total of Nicole and Cindy's cards is 400 + 800 = 1200 cards.
4) Rex collected half of Nicole and Cindy's combined total, so Rex collected 1200 / 2 = 600 cards.
5) Rex divided his 600 cards equally among himself and his three younger siblings, so each person received 600 / 4 = 150 cards.
6) Therefore, Rex has 600 - (3 * 150) = 150 cards left.

Answer: 150
