Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gary bought a used car for $6,000
* He borrowed the money from his dad
* His dad said he could pay him back the full amount over 5 years
* Gary decided to pay the full amount back in 2 years instead

To calculate the monthly payment for the 5-year plan:
* Total amount owed: $6,000
* Time to pay back: 5 years
* Monthly payment = $6,000 / (5 years * 12 months/year) = $100 per month

To calculate the monthly payment for the 2-year plan:
* Total amount owed: $6,000
* Time to pay back: 2 years
* Monthly payment = $6,000 / (2 years * 12 months/year) = $250 per month

Now, to calculate the difference in monthly payments:
* 2-year plan monthly payment: $250
* 5-year plan monthly payment: $100
* Difference in monthly payment: $250 - $100 = $150

Answer: $150
