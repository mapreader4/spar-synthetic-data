Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nellie needs to sell a total of 45 rolls of gift wrap for the fundraiser.
* So far, she has sold:
    - 1 roll to her grandmother
    - 10 rolls to her uncle
    - 6 rolls to a neighbor
* To calculate the total number of rolls she has sold so far, we add these up:
    - 1 + 10 + 6 = 17 rolls
* To find how many more rolls she needs to sell, we subtract the number of rolls she has sold so far from the total she needs to sell:
    - 45 - 17 = 28 rolls

Answer: 28
