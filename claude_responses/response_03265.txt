Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carla's brush is 12 inches long.
2) Carmen's brush is 50% longer than Carla's brush.
3) To find the length of Carmen's brush, we need to add 50% of Carla's brush length to Carla's brush length.
4) 50% of 12 inches is 6 inches.
5) So Carmen's brush is 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches long.
6) Now we need to convert the length to centimeters. We know that 1 inch = 2.5 centimeters.
7) 18 inches x 2.5 cm/inch = 45 centimeters.

Answer: 45
