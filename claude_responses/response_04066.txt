Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 marbles in the jar.

2. On Tuesday, they took 3/5 of the 30 marbles from the jar. 
   * 3/5 of 30 = 18 marbles
   * They divided the 18 marbles equally, so Cleo and Ignacio each had 9 marbles.

3. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the remaining marbles in the jar.
   * The original 30 marbles - the 18 marbles taken on Tuesday = 12 marbles remaining in the jar.
   * Cleo took 1/2 of the 12 remaining marbles, which is 6 marbles.

Therefore, on the third day, Cleo had 6 marbles.

Answer: 6
