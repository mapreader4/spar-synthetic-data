Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rob has 24 baseball cards total.
2) One third of Rob's cards are doubles. To find the number of doubles, we take 1/3 of 24, which is 8 doubles.
3) Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob. Since Rob has 8 doubles, Jess has 5 * 8 = 40 doubles.

Answer: 40
