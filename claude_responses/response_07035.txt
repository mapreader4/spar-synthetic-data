Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There have been 9 assignments so far
* Ahmed has a 91 in the class
* Emily has a 92 in the class
* The final assignment is worth the same amount as all the other assignments
* Emily got a 90 on the final assignment

To beat Emily, Ahmed needs to have a higher total score than Emily. Let's calculate Emily's total score first:
* Emily's total score = (92 * 9 + 90) / 10 = 91.8

Now, to beat Emily, Ahmed needs to have a total score greater than 91.8. Since all grades are whole numbers, the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get on the final assignment is 92.

Answer: 92
