Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tina saved $27 in June, $14 in July, and $21 in August.
2) So the total amount Tina saved is $27 + $14 + $21 = $62.
3) Tina then spent $5 on books and $17 on new shoes.
4) The total amount Tina spent is $5 + $17 = $22.
5) To calculate how much money Tina has left, we take the total amount she saved ($62) and subtract the total amount she spent ($22).
6) $62 - $22 = $40.

Answer: 40
