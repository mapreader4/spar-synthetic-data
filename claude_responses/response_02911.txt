Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Greg bought a 20-pack of granola bars.
2) He set aside one for each day of the week, which is 7 bars.
3) That leaves 20 - 7 = 13 bars remaining.
4) He traded 3 of the remaining bars to his friend Pete for a soda.
5) That leaves 13 - 3 = 10 bars remaining.
6) Greg gave the remaining 10 bars to his two sisters.
7) Since the sisters split them evenly, each sister got 10 / 2 = 5 bars.
