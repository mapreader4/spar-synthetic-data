Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The pizza had 12 slices total
* Ron and his friends each ate 4 slices
* To find the number of friends, we need to subtract Ron's 4 slices from the total 12 slices, and then divide the remaining slices by 4 (since each friend ate 4 slices)

* Total slices: 12
* Ron's slices: 4
* Remaining slices: 12 - 4 = 8
* Number of friends: 8 / 4 = 2

Therefore, there were 2 friends with Ron.

Answer: 2
