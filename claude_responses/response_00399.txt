Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Sam can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes
* Sam worked for 6 hours, which is 360 minutes
* In 360 minutes, Sam can assemble 360 / 10 = 36 widgets
* Jack can assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes
* Jack worked for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes
* In 240 minutes, Jack can assemble (240 / 15) * 2 = 32 widgets
* Together, Sam and Jack assembled 36 + 32 = 68 widgets
* The remaining 0 widgets must have been assembled by Tony
* Since Tony worked for 8 hours, which is 480 minutes, and they completed 0 widgets, it must take Tony x minutes to assemble 1 widget, where x is the unknown we are trying to find.

Answer: 480 minutes
