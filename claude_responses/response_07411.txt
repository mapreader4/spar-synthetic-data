Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The tree is currently 180 inches tall
* This is 50% taller than when it was planted
* To find the original height, we need to find the 50% increase from the original height
* Let's call the original height "x"
* 50% of x is 0.5x
* The current height of 180 inches is 0.5x more than the original height
* So, 180 inches = x + 0.5x
* Solving for x, we get: 180 = 1.5x
* x = 180 / 1.5 = 120 inches
* To convert to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot:
* 120 inches / 12 inches per foot = 10 feet

Answer: 10 feet
