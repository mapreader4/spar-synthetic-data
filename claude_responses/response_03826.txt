Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Greg spent a total of $300 on a shirt and shoes
* He spent 9 more than twice as much on shoes as he did on a shirt
* Let's call the amount he spent on the shirt 'x'
* Then the amount he spent on the shoes would be '2x + 9'
* We know that the total amount spent is $300, so we can set up an equation:
* x + (2x + 9) = 300
* Simplifying this equation:
* 3x + 9 = 300
* 3x = 291
* x = 97
* Therefore, Greg spent $97 on the shirt.

Answer: 97
