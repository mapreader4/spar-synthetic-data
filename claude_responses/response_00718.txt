Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Penny's snake.
2) We also know that the combined length of the two snakes is 70 inches.
3) Let's call Penny's snake length "x" inches.
4) Then Jake's snake length would be "x + 12" inches.
5) The combined length of the two snakes is 70 inches, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 12) = 70
6) Simplifying the equation:
2x + 12 = 70
7) Solving for x:
2x = 58
x = 29
8) Since Penny's snake is 29 inches, Jake's snake must be 29 + 12 = 41 inches.

Answer: 41
