Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The luxury bag costs $3000.
2) The reseller wants to get a 15% profit.
3) To calculate the selling price, we need to find the amount of profit the reseller wants to make.
4) 15% of $3000 is 0.15 * $3000 = $450.
5) The reseller's desired selling price is the cost of the bag ($3000) plus the desired profit ($450).
6) Therefore, the reseller should sell the bag for $3000 + $450 = $3450.

Answer: $3450
