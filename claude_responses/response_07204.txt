Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The 4th grade class has 20 students
* There are 3 teachers
* The total number of people going to the science museum is 20 students + 3 teachers = 23 people
* The entrance ticket costs $5 each
* To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of people (23) by the cost of each ticket ($5)

Therefore, the total cost for the entrance tickets is:
23 people x $5 per ticket = $115

Answer: 115
