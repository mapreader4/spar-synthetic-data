Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have 3 temperatures recorded: -14 degrees Fahrenheit, -8 degrees Fahrenheit, and +1 degree Fahrenheit.
2) To find the average, we need to add up the 3 temperatures and divide by 3.
3) The sum of the 3 temperatures is: -14 + -8 + 1 = -21 degrees Fahrenheit.
4) Dividing the sum by 3, we get: -21 / 3 = -7 degrees Fahrenheit.

Answer: -7 degrees Fahrenheit.
