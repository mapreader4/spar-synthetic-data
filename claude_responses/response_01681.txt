Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jake can wash his car 4 times with 1 bottle of car wash soap
* Each bottle of car wash soap costs $4.00
* Jake washes his car once a week for 20 weeks

To calculate the total cost, we need to find out how many bottles of car wash soap Jake needs for 20 weeks.

Since he can wash his car 4 times with 1 bottle, we can divide the number of weeks (20) by 4 to find out how many bottles he needs:
* 20 weeks / 4 washes per bottle = 5 bottles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bottles (5) by the cost per bottle ($4.00):
* 5 bottles x $4.00 per bottle = $20.00

Answer: $20.00
