Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 100 soccer balls that Nova went to inflate.
2) 40% of the 100 balls had holes in them and could not be inflated.
   * 40% of 100 = 0.40 * 100 = 40 balls could not be inflated.
3) That leaves 100 - 40 = 60 balls that could potentially be inflated.
4) Of those 60 balls, 20% were overinflated and exploded.
   * 20% of 60 = 0.20 * 60 = 12 balls exploded.
5) The number of balls that were inflated successfully and could be used is:
   * 60 - 12 = 48 balls.

Answer: 48
