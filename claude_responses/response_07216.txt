Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James was 2/3s as tall as his uncle, who is 72 inches tall.
2) To find James' original height, we can multiply his uncle's height by 2/3:
   * James' original height = 72 inches * 2/3 = 48 inches
3) James then had a growth spurt and gained 10 inches.
4) So James' new height is 48 inches + 10 inches = 58 inches.
5) To find the difference in height between James' uncle and James now, we subtract James' new height from his uncle's height:
   * Difference in height = 72 inches - 58 inches = 14 inches.

Answer: 14 inches
