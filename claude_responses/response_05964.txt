Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Betty's contributions:
   - 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 4 x 12 = 48 cookies
   - 6 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies = 6 x 12 = 72 cookies
   - 2 dozen regular brownies = 2 x 12 = 24 brownies

2. Paige's contributions:
   - 6 dozen sugar cookies = 6 x 12 = 72 cookies
   - 3 dozen blondies = 3 x 12 = 36 blondies
   - 5 dozen cream cheese swirled brownies = 5 x 12 = 60 brownies

3. Total number of items:
   - Cookies: 48 + 72 + 72 = 192 cookies
   - Blondies/Brownies: 24 + 36 + 60 = 120 blondies/brownies

4. Pricing:
   - Cookies: $1.00 each
   - Blondies/Brownies: $2.00 each

5. Total money raised:
   - Cookies: 192 x $1.00 = $192.00
   - Blondies/Brownies: 120 x $2.00 = $240.00
   - Total: $192.00 + $240.00 = $432.00

Answer: $432
