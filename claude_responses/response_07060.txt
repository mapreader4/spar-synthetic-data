Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Josh has $300 in his wallet initially.
2) He also has $2000 invested in a business.
3) The business's stock price rises 30%.
4) To calculate the new value of the stocks, we take the original value ($2000) and increase it by 30%:
   $2000 + (30% of $2000) = $2000 + $600 = $2600
5) Josh sells all of his stocks, so he now has $2600 in addition to the $300 in his wallet.
6) Therefore, the total amount of money Josh will have in his wallet is:
Answer: $2900
