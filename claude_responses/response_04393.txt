Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hallie wins an art contest and receives a $150 prize.
2) She also sells 3 of her paintings for $50 each.
3) To calculate the total amount of money she makes from her art, we need to add the prize money and the money from selling the paintings.
4) The prize money is $150.
5) The money from selling the 3 paintings is 3 x $50 = $150.
6) Adding the prize money and the money from selling the paintings, we get $150 + $150 = $300.
