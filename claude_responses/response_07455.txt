Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bike tire repairs:
   * Jim charges $20 per repair
   * It costs him $5 in parts per repair
   * He does 300 of these repairs in a month
   * Profit per repair = $20 - $5 = $15
   * Total profit from bike tire repairs = 300 x $15 = $4,500

2. Complex repairs:
   * Jim charges $300 per repair
   * It costs him $50 in parts per repair
   * He does 2 of these repairs in a month
   * Profit per repair = $300 - $50 = $250
   * Total profit from complex repairs = 2 x $250 = $500

3. Retail shop sales:
   * Jim makes $2,000 in profit from retail shop sales

4. Total revenue:
   * Total revenue = Bike tire repairs + Complex repairs + Retail shop sales
   * Total revenue = $4,500 + $500 + $2,000 = $7,000

5. Expenses:
   * Rent and other fixed expenses = $4,000 per month

6. Profit:
   * Profit = Total revenue - Total expenses
   * Profit = $7,000 - $4,000 = $3,000

Answer: $3,000
