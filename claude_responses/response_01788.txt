Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mr. Shaefer harvested 500 lychees in a carton.
2) He sold half of the lychees at the market. So, the number of lychees he sold is 1/2 * 500 = 250.
3) The remaining number of lychees he took home is 500 - 250 = 250.
4) At home, they ate 3/5 of the remaining 250 lychees. So, the number of lychees they ate is 3/5 * 250 = 150.
5) The number of lychees remaining is the original 250 minus the 150 that were eaten, which is 250 - 150 = 100.

Answer: 100
