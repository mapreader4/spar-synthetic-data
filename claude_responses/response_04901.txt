Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Your dog was born when you were 15 years old
* Two years from now, your dog will turn 4 years old
* This means that currently, your dog is 2 years old (4 years old - 2 years)
* Since your dog was born when you were 15 years old, and your dog is currently 2 years old, that means you are currently 15 + 2 = 17 years old.
