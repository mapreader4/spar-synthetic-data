Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ella and Emma each want 2 hotdogs
* So the total number of hotdogs for Ella and Emma is 2 + 2 = 4 hotdogs
* Luke said he could eat twice the amount of hotdogs as his sisters
* So Luke wants 2 x 4 = 8 hotdogs
* Hunter said he could only eat 1 and a half times the total amount of his sisters
* The total amount for the sisters is 4 hotdogs
* So Hunter wants 1.5 x 4 = 6 hotdogs
* To find the total number of hotdogs Matthew needs to cook, we add up the amounts for each child:
* 4 (Ella and Emma) + 8 (Luke) + 6 (Hunter) = 18 hotdogs

Answer: 18 hotdogs
