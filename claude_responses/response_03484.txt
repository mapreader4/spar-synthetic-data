Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The party hall has 3 decorative light bulbs: a red one, a green one, and a blue one.
2) The red light bulb comes on every 2 seconds.
3) The green light bulb comes on every 3 seconds.
4) The blue light bulb comes on every 4 seconds.
5) We want to find the shortest time after which all three bulbs will be on at the same time.
6) To find the shortest time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 4.
7) The LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12.
8) Therefore, the shortest time after which all three bulbs will be on at the same time is 12 seconds.

Answer: 12
