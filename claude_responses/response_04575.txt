Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Laran sells 5 posters per day
* 2 of those posters are large, which sell for $10 each
* The large posters cost $5 each to produce
* The remaining 3 posters are small, which sell for $6 each
* The small posters cost $3 each to produce
* We want to calculate the profit for a 5-day school week

First, let's calculate the revenue for the large posters:
* 2 large posters per day x $10 per poster = $20 per day
* $20 per day x 5 days = $100 total revenue from large posters

Next, let's calculate the cost of the large posters:
* 2 large posters per day x $5 per poster = $10 per day
* $10 per day x 5 days = $50 total cost of large posters

Now, let's calculate the revenue for the small posters:
* 3 small posters per day x $6 per poster = $18 per day
* $18 per day x 5 days = $90 total revenue from small posters

The cost of the small posters is:
* 3 small posters per day x $3 per poster = $9 per day
* $9 per day x 5 days = $45 total cost of small posters

Finally, to calculate the total profit:
* Total revenue = $100 (large posters) + $90 (small posters) = $190
* Total cost = $50 (large posters) + $45 (small posters) = $95
* Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $190 - $95 = $95

Answer: $95
