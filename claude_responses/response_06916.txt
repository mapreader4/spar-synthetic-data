Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The book costs $50.
2) The store marks the book 30% above the cost. This means the selling price before the discount is:
   $50 + (0.30 * $50) = $50 + $15 = $65
3) During the sale, a 10% discount is given. This means the final selling price is:
   $65 - (0.10 * $65) = $65 - $6.50 = $58.50
4) The percent profit is calculated as: (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost * 100
   Percent profit = ($58.50 - $50) / $50 * 100 = 17%
