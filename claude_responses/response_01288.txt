Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James spends 3 hours vacuuming
* He spends 3 times as long on the rest of his chores
* To find the total time spent on his chores, we need to add the time spent vacuuming and the time spent on the rest of his chores

First, let's calculate the time spent on the rest of his chores:
* 3 times as long as the time spent vacuuming
* 3 hours x 3 = 9 hours

Now, let's add the time spent vacuuming and the time spent on the rest of his chores:
* 3 hours + 9 hours = 12 hours

Answer: 12 hours
