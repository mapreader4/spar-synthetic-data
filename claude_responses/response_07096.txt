Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The original price of the gummy vitamins is $15.00 per bottle.
2. The gummy vitamins are currently 20% off.
3. To calculate the discounted price, we take the original price and subtract 20%:
   * 20% of $15.00 = $3.00
   * $15.00 - $3.00 = $12.00 per bottle
4. Ken has 3 $2.00 coupons, which means he can deduct $6.00 from the total.
5. To calculate the total cost for 3 bottles:
   * 3 bottles x $12.00 per bottle = $36.00
   * $36.00 - $6.00 (from the coupons) = $30.00

Answer: $30
