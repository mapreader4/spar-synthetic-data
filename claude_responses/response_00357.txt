Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Catriona has 8 goldfish in her aquarium.
2) She has 4 more angelfish than goldfish, so the number of angelfish is 8 + 4 = 12.
3) She has twice as many guppies as angelfish, so the number of guppies is 12 x 2 = 24.
4) To find the total number of fish in the aquarium, we add up the number of goldfish, angelfish, and guppies:
8 goldfish + 12 angelfish + 24 guppies = 44 fish.

Answer: 44
