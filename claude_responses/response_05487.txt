Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mitchell has 30 pencils.
2) Mitchell has 6 more pencils than Antonio.
3) To find the number of pencils Antonio has, we can subtract 6 from Mitchell's 30 pencils:
30 - 6 = 24
4) So Antonio has 24 pencils.
5) To find the total number of pencils Mitchell and Antonio have together, we add their individual pencil counts:
30 + 24 = 54

Answer: 54
