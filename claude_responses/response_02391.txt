Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lucas makes 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each of his students on Monday
* Last Monday, he made 40 pieces of chocolate candy
* This means he had 10 students in his class last Monday (40 pieces / 4 pieces per student = 10 students)
* This upcoming Monday, 3 of Lucas' students will not be coming to class
* So, he will have 10 - 3 = 7 students in his class this upcoming Monday
* Therefore, Lucas will make 7 students x 4 pieces of chocolate candy per student = 28 pieces of chocolate candy for his class on Monday.

Answer: 28
