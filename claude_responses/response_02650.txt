Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jack has $45 and 36 euros.
2) Each euro is worth two dollars.
3) To calculate the total value of the 36 euros in dollars, we multiply 36 by 2, which gives us 72 dollars.
4) To calculate the total amount of money Jack has, we add the $45 and the 72 dollars from the euros.
5) $45 + $72 = $117.
