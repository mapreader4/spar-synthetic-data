Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 12 crates, and each crate contains 150 oranges.
2) To find the total number of oranges in the crates, we multiply the number of crates (12) by the number of oranges in each crate (150):
12 crates x 150 oranges per crate = 1,800 oranges
3) There are 16 boxes, and each box holds 30 nectarines.
4) To find the total number of nectarines in the boxes, we multiply the number of boxes (16) by the number of nectarines in each box (30):
16 boxes x 30 nectarines per box = 480 nectarines
5) To find the total number of pieces of fruit in the crates and boxes, we add the number of oranges (1,800) and the number of nectarines (480):
1,800 oranges + 480 nectarines = 2,280 pieces of fruit

Answer: 2,280
