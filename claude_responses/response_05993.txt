Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John eats 1800 calories a day and burns 2300 calories a day.
2) This means he has a calorie deficit of 2300 - 1800 = 500 calories per day.
3) To lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 4000 calories.
4) Since he has a 500 calorie deficit per day, it will take him 4000 / 500 = 8 days to lose 1 pound.
5) To lose 10 pounds, it will take him 10 * 8 = 80 days.

Answer: 80 days
