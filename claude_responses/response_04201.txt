Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. At the end of the first quarter, the winning team had double the points of the losing team. The losing team had 10 points in the first quarter, so the winning team had 20 points in the first quarter.

2. At the end of the second quarter, the winning team had 10 more points than it started with. So, the winning team had 20 + 10 = 30 points at the end of the second quarter.

3. At the end of the third quarter, the winning team had 20 more points than the number it had in the second quarter. So, the winning team had 30 + 20 = 50 points at the end of the third quarter.

4. The total points the winning team scored in the game was 80. We can subtract the points they had at the end of the third quarter (50) to find the points they scored in the fourth quarter.

80 - 50 = 30

Therefore, the winning team scored 30 points in the fourth quarter.

Answer: 30
