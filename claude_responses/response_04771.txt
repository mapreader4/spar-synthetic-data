Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The cost to rent the car is $150.
2. John had to buy 8 gallons of gas, and gas costs $3.50 per gallon. So the cost of gas is:
   8 gallons x $3.50 per gallon = $28
3. The final expense is $0.50 per mile, and John drove 320 miles. So the cost for the miles driven is:
   320 miles x $0.50 per mile = $160
4. To calculate the total cost, we add up the rental cost, gas cost, and cost for miles driven:
   $150 + $28 + $160 = $338

Answer: $338
