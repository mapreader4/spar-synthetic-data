Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Annie spent a total of 67 minutes on the diorama
* The amount of time she spent building it is equal to three times the amount of time she spent planning it minus 5 minutes
* Let's represent the amount of time she spent planning it as "x" minutes
* So the amount of time she spent building it is 3x - 5 minutes
* We know the total time spent is 67 minutes, so we can set up an equation:
x + (3x - 5) = 67
* Simplifying this equation:
4x - 5 = 67
* Solving for x:
4x = 72
x = 18
* So she spent 18 minutes planning the diorama
* And she spent 3(18) - 5 = 49 minutes building the diorama

Answer: 49 minutes
