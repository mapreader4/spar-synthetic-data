Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Athena bought 3 sandwiches at $3 each
* So the total cost of the sandwiches is 3 x $3 = $9
* Athena also bought 2 fruit drinks at $2.5 each
* So the total cost of the fruit drinks is 2 x $2.5 = $5
* To calculate the total amount Athena spent, we add the cost of the sandwiches and the fruit drinks:
* $9 + $5 = $14
