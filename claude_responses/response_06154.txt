Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary has a total of 60 characters in her story
* Half of the characters have the initial A, so that's 30 characters with the initial A
* Half of the 30 characters with the initial A have the initial C, so that's 15 characters with the initial C
* The remaining characters have the initials D and E
* There are twice as many characters with the initial D as there are characters with the initial E
* Let's call the number of characters with the initial D as x
* Then the number of characters with the initial E is x/2
* The total number of characters with the initials D and E is 60 - 30 - 15 = 15
* So we can write the equation: x + x/2 = 15
* Solving for x, we get: 3x/2 = 15
* x = 10

Answer: 10
