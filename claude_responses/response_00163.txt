Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James scores 4 touchdowns per game
* Each touchdown is worth 6 points
* There are 15 games in the season
* So, the total points from touchdowns = 4 touchdowns per game x 6 points per touchdown x 15 games = 360 points

* James also scores 2 point conversions 6 times during the season
* Each 2 point conversion is worth 2 points
* So, the total points from 2 point conversions = 6 x 2 points = 12 points

* The total points James scored = 360 points (from touchdowns) + 12 points (from 2 point conversions) = 372 points

* The old record was 300 points during the season
* So, James beat the old record by:
* 372 points - 300 points = 72 points

Answer: 72
