Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bottle of spirits costs $30.00 and has 16 servings per bottle
* Most restaurants will charge $8.00 for one serving
* To calculate the total revenue the restaurant makes on a bottle of spirits, we need to multiply the number of servings (16) by the price per serving ($8.00)
* 16 servings x $8.00 per serving = $128.00 total revenue

Now, to calculate the profit the restaurant makes on a bottle of spirits, we need to subtract the cost of the bottle ($30.00) from the total revenue ($128.00):
* $128.00 total revenue - $30.00 cost of bottle = $98.00 profit

Answer: $98.00
