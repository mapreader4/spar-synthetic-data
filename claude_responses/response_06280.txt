Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The total number of cheese sticks in the pack is 15 + 30 + 45 = 90.
2) Out of the 90 cheese sticks, 45 are pepperjack.
3) To calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked cheese stick will be pepperjack, we need to divide the number of pepperjack sticks by the total number of sticks and multiply by 100.
4) 45 / 90 = 0.5
5) 0.5 * 100 = 50%

Answer: 50
