Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Annie plants 3 pots of basil, 9 pots of rosemary, and 6 pots of thyme.
2) Each basil plant has 4 leaves, so for the 3 pots of basil, there are 3 * 4 = 12 basil leaves.
3) Each rosemary plant has 18 leaves, so for the 9 pots of rosemary, there are 9 * 18 = 162 rosemary leaves.
4) Each thyme plant has 30 leaves, so for the 6 pots of thyme, there are 6 * 30 = 180 thyme leaves.
5) To get the total number of leaves, we add the leaves from the basil, rosemary, and thyme:
12 + 162 + 180 = 354

Answer: 354
