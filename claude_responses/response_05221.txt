Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The chef has 60 eggs in total
* He puts 10 eggs in the fridge, leaving him with 60 - 10 = 50 eggs
* He uses the remaining 50 eggs to make cakes
* Each cake requires 5 eggs
* To find the number of cakes, we divide the total number of eggs used (50) by the number of eggs per cake (5)
* 50 eggs / 5 eggs per cake = 10 cakes

Answer: 10
