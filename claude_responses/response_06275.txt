Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tanesha needs to cut the rope into 10 pieces that are each 6 inches long.
2) 1 foot = 12 inches, so the 6-foot length of rope has 72 inches.
3) 72 inches / 6 inches per piece = 12 pieces
4) The 6-foot length of rope costs $5, so the cost per inch is $5 / 72 inches = $0.0694 per inch.
5) The 1-foot lengths of rope cost $1.25 each, so the cost per inch is $1.25 / 12 inches = $0.1042 per inch.
6) To get 10 pieces that are each 6 inches long, Tanesha needs 60 inches of rope total.
7) Using the 6-foot length of rope, Tanesha can get 10 pieces for $5.
8) Using the 1-foot lengths of rope, Tanesha would need to buy 5 pieces at $1.25 each, for a total of $6.25.
9) The least Tanesha has to spend is $5 for the 6-foot length of rope.
