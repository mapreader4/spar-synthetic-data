Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lanie's usual work week is 40 hours.
2) She was only able to work 4/5 of her usual 40-hour week.
3) To calculate the number of hours she worked, we multiply 40 hours by 4/5: 40 * 4/5 = 32 hours.
4) Lanie's hourly rate is $15.
5) To calculate her salary for the week, we multiply the number of hours she worked (32 hours) by her hourly rate ($15): 32 * $15 = $480.

Answer: $480
