To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Keaton can earn from selling his oranges and apples in a year.

Given information:
- Keaton can harvest oranges every 2 months and sell them for $50.
- Keaton can harvest apples every 3 months and sell them for $30.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times Keaton can harvest oranges in a year.
Number of months in a year = 12
Number of months between each orange harvest = 2
Number of orange harvests in a year = 12 months / 2 months = 6 harvests

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Keaton can earn from selling oranges in a year.
Total money from oranges = Number of orange harvests × Price per harvest
Total money from oranges = 6 × $50 = $300

Step 3: Calculate the number of times Keaton can harvest apples in a year.
Number of months in a year = 12
Number of months between each apple harvest = 3
Number of apple harvests in a year = 12 months / 3 months = 4 harvests

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Keaton can earn from selling apples in a year.
Total money from apples = Number of apple harvests × Price per harvest
Total money from apples = 4 × $30 = $120

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Keaton can earn in a year.
Total money earned = Total money from oranges + Total money from apples
Total money earned = $300 + $120 = $420

Answer: $420
