Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Prudence made 2 dozen (24) cupcakes, but 2 dozen were burnt and had to be thrown out.
* That leaves 0 cupcakes from the first batch.
* She then made 2 more dozen (24) cupcakes, and ate 5 of them.
* That leaves 19 cupcakes from the second batch.
* She then made 2 more dozen (24) cupcakes, and ate 4 of them.
* That leaves 20 cupcakes from the third batch.
* In total, she has 19 + 20 = 39 cupcakes remaining.
* Each cupcake costs $0.75 to make.
* She sells each cupcake for $2.00.
* Her total revenue is 39 cupcakes x $2.00 = $78.
* Her total cost is 39 cupcakes x $0.75 = $29.25.
* Her net profit is her total revenue minus her total cost:
* $78 - $29.25 = $48.75.

Answer: $48.75.
