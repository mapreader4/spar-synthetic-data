Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first gym membership costs $10 per month and has a sign-up fee of $50.
   * For the first year (12 months), the cost of the first gym membership would be:
     * 12 months x $10 per month = $120
     * Plus the sign-up fee of $50
     * Total cost for the first gym membership in the first year = $120 + $50 = $170

2. The second gym membership is 3 times more expensive than the first one, so it costs $30 per month.
   * The sign-up fee for the second gym is 4 months membership, so:
     * 4 months x $30 per month = $120 sign-up fee

3. To find the total cost for both gym memberships in the first year, we add the costs:
   * Total cost = Cost of first gym + Cost of second gym
   * Total cost = $170 + $120 + (12 months x $30 per month)
   * Total cost = $290 + $360
   * Total cost = $650

Answer: $650
