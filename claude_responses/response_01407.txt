Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nina has two pairs of shoes.
2) The first pair of shoes cost $22.
3) The second pair of shoes was 50% more expensive than the first pair.
4) To calculate the cost of the second pair of shoes, we take the cost of the first pair ($22) and add 50% of that cost:
   * 50% of $22 = $11
   * $22 + $11 = $33
5) So the second pair of shoes cost $33.
6) To calculate the total amount Nina paid for both pairs of shoes, we add the cost of the first pair ($22) and the cost of the second pair ($33):
   * $22 + $33 = $55

Answer: 55
