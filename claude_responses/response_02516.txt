Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Initially, Kate has 2 red balloons and 4 blue balloons.
2) She then inflates 2 more red balloons and 2 more blue balloons, so now she has 4 red balloons and 6 blue balloons.
3) The total number of balloons is 4 + 6 = 10.
4) The number of red balloons is 4.
5) The percent likelihood that a randomly selected balloon will be red is the number of red balloons divided by the total number of balloons, multiplied by 100.
6) 4 / 10 = 0.4
7) 0.4 * 100 = 40%

Answer: 40
