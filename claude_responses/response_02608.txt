Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anna puts 3 slices of ham in each sandwich
* She has 31 slices of ham
* She wants to make 50 ham sandwiches

To find out how many more slices of ham she needs, we need to first calculate how many slices of ham she can use to make 50 sandwiches.
* 3 slices of ham per sandwich x 50 sandwiches = 150 slices of ham needed

Now, we can subtract the 31 slices of ham she already has from the 150 slices needed:
* 150 slices needed - 31 slices she has = 119 more slices of ham needed

Answer: 119
