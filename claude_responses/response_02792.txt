Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Liam has 10 students in his art class
* He has 20 art kits that he hands out, 1 art kit for 2 students
* Half the students (5 students) make 3 artworks each
* The other half of the students (5 students) make 4 artworks each

First, let's calculate the number of artworks made by the 5 students who made 3 artworks each:
* 5 students x 3 artworks each = 15 artworks

Next, let's calculate the number of artworks made by the 5 students who made 4 artworks each:
* 5 students x 4 artworks each = 20 artworks

Now, we add the two numbers together to get the total number of artistic works created by the whole class:
* 15 artworks + 20 artworks = 35 artworks

Answer: 35
