Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jordan caught 4 fish.
2) Perry caught double what Jordan caught, which is 2 x 4 = 8 fish.
3) The total catch before the boat tipped over was Jordan's 4 fish plus Perry's 8 fish, which is 4 + 8 = 12 fish.
4) When the boat tipped over, they lost one-fourth of their total catch. One-fourth of 12 is 3.
5) The number of fish that remain is the total catch (12) minus the fish they lost (3).
