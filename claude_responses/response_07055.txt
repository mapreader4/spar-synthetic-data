Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cindy had 20 marbles.
2) Lisa had 5 fewer marbles than Cindy, so Lisa had 20 - 5 = 15 marbles.
3) Cindy then gave Lisa 12 of her marbles.
4) So now Cindy has 20 - 12 = 8 marbles.
5) And Lisa now has 15 + 12 = 27 marbles.
6) The question asks how many more marbles Lisa has now. 
7) Lisa has 27 marbles, and Cindy has 8 marbles.
8) So Lisa has 27 - 8 = 19 more marbles than Cindy.

Answer: 19
