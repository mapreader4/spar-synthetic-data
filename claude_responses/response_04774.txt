To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average jump of each athlete and determine the winner.

For the first athlete:
Long jump: 26 feet
Triple jump: 30 feet
High jump: 7 feet

To find the average, we add the three jump distances and divide by 3:
(26 + 30 + 7) / 3 = 63 / 3 = 21 feet

For the second athlete:
Long jump: 24 feet
Triple jump: 34 feet
High jump: 8 feet

To find the average, we add the three jump distances and divide by 3:
(24 + 34 + 8) / 3 = 66 / 3 = 22 feet

The second athlete had the higher average jump of 22 feet, so they were the winner.

Answer: 22 feet
