Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of the lunch was $100.
2) The sales tax in New York is 4%, which means the tax amount is 4% of $100, which is $4.
3) The tip is 6% of the pre-tax amount, which is $100. 6% of $100 is $6.
4) To calculate the total amount Greg paid, we add the cost of the lunch ($100), the sales tax ($4), and the tip ($6).
5) $100 + $4 + $6 = $110.

Answer: 110
