Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Vera has 20 dolls.
2) Sophie has twice as many dolls as Vera, so Sophie has 2 x 20 = 40 dolls.
3) Aida has twice as many dolls as Sophie, so Aida has 2 x 40 = 80 dolls.
4) To find the total number of dolls that Aida, Sophie, and Vera have combined, we add their individual amounts:
Aida: 80 dolls
Sophie: 40 dolls
Vera: 20 dolls
Total: 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 dolls.

Answer: 140
