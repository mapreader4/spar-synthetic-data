Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mcgee's Bakery sold 16 pies.
2) Smith's Bakery sold 6 more than four times the number of pies that Mcgee's Bakery sold.
3) To calculate the number of pies Smith's Bakery sold, we first need to find four times the number of pies Mcgee's Bakery sold.
4) Four times 16 is 64.
5) Then, we add 6 to 64 to get the number of pies Smith's Bakery sold.
6) 64 + 6 = 70.
