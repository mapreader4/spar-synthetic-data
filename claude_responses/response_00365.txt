To solve this problem, we need to find the total time taken by all eight runners to finish the race.

Given information:
- There are 8 runners in the race.
- The first 5 runners finish the race in 8 hours.
- The remaining 3 runners finish the race 2 hours later.

Step 1: Calculate the total time taken by the first 5 runners.
Time taken by the first 5 runners = 8 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the remaining 3 runners.
Time taken by the remaining 3 runners = 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time taken by all 8 runners.
Total time taken by all 8 runners = Time taken by the first 5 runners + Time taken by the remaining 3 runners
Total time taken by all 8 runners = 8 hours + 10 hours = 18 hours

Answer: 18
