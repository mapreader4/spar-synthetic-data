Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total computers sold = 72
* Half of the sales are laptops, so the number of laptops sold is 1/2 of 72 = 36
* One-third of the sales are netbooks, so the number of netbooks sold is 1/3 of 72 = 24
* The remaining computers must be desktop computers

To find the number of desktop computers, we need to subtract the number of laptops and netbooks from the total number of computers sold:
* Desktop computers = Total computers - Laptops - Netbooks
* Desktop computers = 72 - 36 - 24 = 12

Answer: 12
