Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Juanita goes through 1 bottle of sunscreen per month
* There are 12 months in a year
* So, Juanita needs 12 bottles of sunscreen for the entire year
* Each bottle costs $30.00
* The website offers a 30% discount on the entire purchase
* To calculate the total cost before the discount:
  - 12 bottles x $30.00 per bottle = $360.00
* To calculate the discount amount:
  - 30% of $360.00 = 0.30 x $360.00 = $108.00
* To calculate the total cost after the discount:
  - $360.00 - $108.00 = $252.00

Answer: $252
