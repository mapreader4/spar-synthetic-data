Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. During middle school, Kathleen's allowance was $2 more than $8.
   * Middle school allowance = $8 + $2 = $10

2. During her senior year, Kathleen's allowance was $5 more than twice her middle school allowance.
   * Senior year allowance = (2 × $10) + $5 = $25

3. To calculate the percentage increase in Kathleen's weekly allowance:
   * Percentage increase = (Increase in allowance / Original allowance) × 100
   * Increase in allowance = $25 - $10 = $15
   * Percentage increase = ($15 / $10) × 100 = 150%

Answer: 150%
