Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The spacecraft Gibraltar can carry 300 family units
* Each family unit has 4 people
* So the full capacity of the spacecraft is 300 family units x 4 people per family = 1,200 people
* However, when the spacecraft leaves Earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of the ship's capacity
* One-third of the ship's capacity is 1,200 / 3 = 400 people
* 100 people less than 400 is 400 - 100 = 300 people

Answer: 300 people will be on the ship to start the journey.
