Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gladys will be 40 years old ten years from now, so her current age is 30 years old.
2) Juanico is 4 years less than half the age of Gladys. 
3) Half of Gladys' age is 30 / 2 = 15 years old.
4) Juanico is 4 years less than 15, so Juanico's current age is 15 - 4 = 11 years old.
5) We want to find Juanico's age 30 years from now. 
6) 30 years from now, Juanico will be 11 + 30 = 41 years old.

Answer: 41
