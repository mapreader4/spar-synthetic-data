Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emily has 7 times as many oranges as Sandra.
2) Sandra has 3 times as many oranges as Betty.
3) Betty has 12 oranges.
4) Since Sandra has 3 times as many oranges as Betty, and Betty has 12 oranges, then Sandra must have 3 * 12 = 36 oranges.
5) Since Emily has 7 times as many oranges as Sandra, and Sandra has 36 oranges, then Emily must have 7 * 36 = 252 oranges.

Answer: 252
