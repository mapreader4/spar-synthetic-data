Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sebastian bought tickets for 3 people: himself and his parents
* The ticket price per person is $44
* There is an additional $18 service fee for the online transaction
To calculate the total amount paid, we need to:
1. Multiply the ticket price per person ($44) by the number of people (3) to get the total cost of the tickets:
   * $44 x 3 = $132
2. Add the $18 service fee to the total cost of the tickets:
   * $132 + $18 = $150
Therefore, the total amount Sebastian paid for the tickets is:
Answer: $150
