Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Iris bought 3 jackets at $10 each
* So the total cost of the jackets is 3 * $10 = $30
* Iris bought 2 pairs of shorts at $6 each
* So the total cost of the shorts is 2 * $6 = $12
* Iris bought 4 pairs of pants at $12 each
* So the total cost of the pants is 4 * $12 = $48
* To calculate the total amount Iris spent, we add up the costs of the jackets, shorts, and pants:
* $30 + $12 + $48 = $90

Answer: 90
