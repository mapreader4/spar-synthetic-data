Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tomas ate 1.5 pounds of chocolate fudge
* Katya ate 0.5 pounds of peanut butter fudge (half a pound)
* Boris ate 2 pounds of fudge
* To find the total amount of fudge eaten, we need to add up the amounts for each person:
* Tomas: 1.5 pounds
* Katya: 0.5 pounds
* Boris: 2 pounds
* Total fudge eaten = 1.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 4 pounds
* There are 16 ounces in 1 pound
* 4 pounds x 16 ounces/pound = 64 ounces

Answer: 64 ounces
