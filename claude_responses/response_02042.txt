Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The PTA had $400 saved from a fundraising event.
2) They spent a fourth of the $400 on school supplies. 
   * A fourth of $400 is $400 / 4 = $100.
   * So they spent $100 on school supplies.
3) After spending $100 on school supplies, they had $400 - $100 = $300 left.
4) They then spent half of the $300 on food for the faculty.
   * Half of $300 is $300 / 2 = $150.
   * So they spent $150 on food for the faculty.
5) After spending $150 on food for the faculty, they had $300 - $150 = $150 left.

Answer: $150
