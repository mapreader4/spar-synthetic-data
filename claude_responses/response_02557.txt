Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Olivine has 5 more precious stones than agate
* Agate has 30 precious stones
* Therefore, olivine has 30 + 5 = 35 precious stones
* Diamond has 11 more precious stones than olivine
* Therefore, diamond has 35 + 11 = 46 precious stones
* To find the total number of precious stones, we add the number of precious stones for each type:
* Agate: 30 precious stones
* Olivine: 35 precious stones
* Diamond: 46 precious stones
* Total: 30 + 35 + 46 = 111 precious stones

Answer: 111
