Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 rows of people relaxing at the beach
* The first row originally had 24 people
* 3 people from the first row got up to wade in the water, so now there are 24 - 3 = 21 people in the first row
* The second row originally had 20 people
* 5 people from the second row went to join the people in the water, so now there are 20 - 5 = 15 people in the second row
* The third row has 18 people

To find the total number of people left relaxing on the beach, we add up the number of people in each row:
* First row: 21 people
* Second row: 15 people
* Third row: 18 people
* Total: 21 + 15 + 18 = 54 people

Answer: 54
