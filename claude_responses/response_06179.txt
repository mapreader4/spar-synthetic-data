Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sarah is currently 9 years old.
2) The game consists of adding the number of letters in the player's name plus twice the player's age.
3) To find the number of letters in Sarah's name, we count them: S-A-R-A-H = 5 letters.
4) Twice Sarah's age is 2 x 9 = 18.
5) Adding the number of letters in Sarah's name (5) and twice her age (18), we get: 5 + 18 = 23.

Answer: 23
