Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The cake weighs 400 grams and is divided into 8 equal parts.
2) Each part of the cake weighs 400 / 8 = 50 grams.
3) Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, which is 50 grams.
4) Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate, which is 2 * 50 = 100 grams.

Answer: 100 grams.
