Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rayman works out for half the number of hours Junior takes to work out
* Let's say Junior works out for x hours in a week
* Then Rayman works out for x/2 hours in a week
* We know that Rayman works out for 10 hours in a week
* So, x/2 = 10
* Solving for x, we get x = 20 hours
* Wolverine works out for twice the combined total number of hours both Rayman and Junior take during their workouts
* The combined total number of hours Rayman and Junior take is 10 + 20 = 30 hours
* Wolverine works out for 2 * 30 = 60 hours

Answer: 60
