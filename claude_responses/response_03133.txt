Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gabriela's grove has 110 trees, and each tree produced 600 oranges
* So, Gabriela's total orange production is 110 * 600 = 66,000 oranges
* Alba's grove has 110 trees, and each tree produced 400 oranges
* So, Alba's total orange production is 110 * 400 = 44,000 oranges
* Maricela's grove has 110 trees, and each tree produced 500 oranges
* So, Maricela's total orange production is 110 * 500 = 55,000 oranges
* The total orange production across all three groves is 66,000 + 44,000 + 55,000 = 165,000 oranges
* It takes 3 medium-sized oranges to make 1 cup of juice
* So, the total number of cups of juice they can make is 165,000 / 3 = 55,000 cups
* They sell each cup for $4
* So, the total money they will make is 55,000 * $4 = $220,000

Answer: $220,000
