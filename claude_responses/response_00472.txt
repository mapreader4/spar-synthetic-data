Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lydia planted the apple tree when she was 4 years old
* It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit
* Lydia is now 9 years old

To find out how old Lydia will be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time, we need to add the number of years it takes for the tree to bear fruit to Lydia's age when she planted the tree.

* Lydia's age when she planted the tree: 4 years old
* Time it takes for the tree to bear fruit: 7 years
* Lydia's age when she gets to eat an apple: 4 + 7 = 11 years old
