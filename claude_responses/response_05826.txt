Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There is 1 dog running through the field initially.
* The dog is then joined by a group of 4 cats.
* So now there are 1 dog + 4 cats = 5 animals running through the field.
* Each of the 4 cats is then joined by 2 rabbits.
* So now there are 4 x 2 = 8 rabbits running through the field.
* Each of the 8 rabbits is then joined by 3 hares.
* So now there are 8 x 3 = 24 hares running through the field.
* In total, there are:
  - 1 dog
  - 4 cats
  - 8 rabbits
  - 24 hares
* Adding these up, the total number of animals running through the field is:
  1 + 4 + 8 + 24 = 37

Answer: 37
