Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jesse's performance over the first 4 days:
   - Days 1-3: Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile per day
   - Day 4: Jesse runs 10 miles
   - Total miles run by Jesse in the first 4 days: (2/3) x 3 + 10 = 12 miles

2. Mia's performance over the first 4 days:
   - Mia averages 3 miles per day
   - Total miles run by Mia in the first 4 days: 3 x 4 = 12 miles

3. Total miles run by both Jesse and Mia in the first 4 days: 12 + 12 = 24 miles

4. Remaining miles to be run in the final 3 days: 30 - 24 = 6 miles

5. The average of the miles they need to run over the final 3 days is:
   - Average = Remaining miles / Number of days = 6 / 3 = 2 miles
