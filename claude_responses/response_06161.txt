Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Jermaine, Terrence, and Emilee earn a total of $90.
2) We also know that Jermaine earns $5 more than Terrence in a month.
3) We are told that Terrence earns $30.
4) Since Jermaine earns $5 more than Terrence, we can calculate Jermaine's earnings as $30 + $5 = $35.
5) Now we can calculate Emilee's earnings by subtracting Jermaine's and Terrence's earnings from the total of $90:
$90 - $35 - $30 = $25.

Answer: $25.
