Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each bunny comes out of its burrow 3 times per minute
* There are 20 bunnies
* We want to calculate the combined number of times the 20 bunnies will have come out of their burrows in 10 hours

First, let's calculate the number of times each bunny will come out of its burrow in 10 hours:
* 3 times per minute x 60 minutes per hour x 10 hours = 1,800 times

Now, let's calculate the combined number of times the 20 bunnies will have come out of their burrows in 10 hours:
* 1,800 times per bunny x 20 bunnies = 36,000 times

Answer: 36,000
