Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jonah started with 14 small fish
* He added 2 more fish
* So now he has 14 + 2 = 16 fish
* But then 6 of his original 14 fish were eaten by the 2 new fish
* So now he has 14 - 6 = 8 fish left
* He then exchanged the 2 fish that ate the 6 fish for 3 new fish
* So now he has 8 + 3 = 11 fish

Answer: 11
