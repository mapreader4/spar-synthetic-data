1) Neeley bought a loaf of bread and sliced it into 12 pieces.
2) His family ate a third of the 12 bread slices for breakfast.
   * 1/3 of 12 = 4 slices eaten for breakfast
3) Neeley then used 2 bread slices to make a sandwich for lunch.
   * 12 slices - 4 slices eaten for breakfast - 2 slices used for lunch = 6 slices remaining.
