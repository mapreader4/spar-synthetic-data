Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Derek has $960 to buy his books for the semester.
2) He spends half of that on his textbooks. Half of $960 is $480, so he spends $480 on textbooks.
3) He has $960 - $480 = $480 left.
4) He spends a quarter of the remaining $480 on his school supplies. A quarter of $480 is $120, so he spends $120 on school supplies.
5) He has $480 - $120 = $360 left.

Answer: $360
