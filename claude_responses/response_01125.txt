Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Angela's kitchen supplies:
   - 20 pots
   - 6 more than three times as many plates as the pots
     - Plates = (3 x 20) + 6 = 66
   - Half as many cutlery as the plates
     - Cutlery = 66 / 2 = 33

2. Sharon's kitchen supplies:
   - Pots = Half as many as Angela
     - Pots = 20 / 2 = 10
   - Plates = 20 less than three times as many as Angela
     - Plates = (3 x 66) - 20 = 178
   - Cutlery = Twice as much as Angela
     - Cutlery = 33 x 2 = 66

3. Total number of kitchen supplies Sharon wants to buy:
   - Pots: 10
   - Plates: 178
   - Cutlery: 66
   - Total = 10 + 178 + 66 = 254

Answer: 254
