Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Charles bought a t-shirt for $30, a backpack for $10, and a blue cap for $5.
2) The total cost of these items is $30 + $10 + $5 = $45.
3) Charles only spent $43 in total, which means he received a discount.
4) To calculate the discount, we need to subtract the amount he spent ($43) from the original total cost ($45).
5) $45 - $43 = $2.

Answer: $2
