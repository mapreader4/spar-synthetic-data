Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The assignment is to collect 60 different fruit seeds.
2) Apples average 6 seeds each, pears average 2 seeds each, and grapes average 3 seeds each.
3) Steven has set aside 4 apples, 3 pears, and 9 grapes to extract their seeds.
4) To calculate the number of seeds Steven has already collected:
   - 4 apples x 6 seeds/apple = 24 seeds
   - 3 pears x 2 seeds/pear = 6 seeds
   - 9 grapes x 3 seeds/grape = 27 seeds
5) The total number of seeds Steven has already collected is 24 + 6 + 27 = 57 seeds.
6) To find how many more seeds he needs to fulfill the assignment, we subtract the number of seeds he has already collected from the total required:
   - 60 seeds required - 57 seeds collected = 3 more seeds needed.
