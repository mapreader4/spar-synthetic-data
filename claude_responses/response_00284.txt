Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The massager vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second at the lowest setting.
2) At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster. 
   * 60% of 1600 is 960.
   * So, the vibrations per second at the highest setting is 1600 + 960 = 2560.
3) Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes at the highest setting.
   * 5 minutes = 300 seconds.
4) To find the total number of vibrations, we multiply the vibrations per second by the number of seconds:
   * 2560 vibrations per second x 300 seconds = 768,000 vibrations.

Answer: 768,000
