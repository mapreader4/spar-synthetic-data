Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Fernanda purchased 6 audiobooks
* Each audiobook is 30 hours long
* She listened to 2 hours of an audiobook each day

To find the total time it took her to finish the six audiobooks, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of hours for all 6 audiobooks:
   * 6 audiobooks x 30 hours per audiobook = 180 total hours

2. Calculate the number of days it took her to listen to all 6 audiobooks:
   * 180 total hours / 2 hours per day = 90 days

Therefore, the total time it took Fernanda to finish the six audiobooks is 90 days.

Answer: 90
