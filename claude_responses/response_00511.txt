Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The merchant installed 15 kg of carrots, 13 kg of zucchini, and 8 kg of broccoli.
* The total mass of vegetables installed is 15 kg + 13 kg + 8 kg = 36 kg.
* The merchant sold only half of the total vegetables installed.
* To calculate the mass of vegetables sold, we take half of the total mass installed:
* 36 kg / 2 = 18 kg.

Answer: 18 kg
