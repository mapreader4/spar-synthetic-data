Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenny brought in 40 peanut butter cookies and 50 chocolate chip cookies
* Marcus brought in 30 peanut butter cookies and 20 lemon cookies
* In total, there are:
    - 40 + 30 = 70 peanut butter cookies
    - 50 chocolate chip cookies
    - 20 lemon cookies
* Renee, who is allergic to peanuts, is picking a cookie at random
* The total number of cookies is 70 + 50 + 20 = 140
* The number of cookies Renee could have an allergic reaction to is 70 (the peanut butter cookies)
* The probability of Renee having an allergic reaction is 70/140 = 0.5
* To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
* 0.5 * 100 = 50%

Answer: 50%
