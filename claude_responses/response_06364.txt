Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Toby sold a treadmill for $100
2) He sold a chest of drawers for half as much as the treadmill, which is $50
3) He sold a television for three times as much as the treadmill, which is $300
4) These three items made up 75% of the total sales
5) To find the total sales, we need to find the value of the 75% that these three items represent
6) The value of the three items is $100 + $50 + $300 = $450
7) Since this is 75% of the total, we can divide $450 by 0.75 to get the total sales
8) $450 / 0.75 = $600

Answer: $600
