Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 20 skeletons in the graveyard.
2) Half of these skeletons are adult women, so that's 10 adult women.
3) The remaining 10 skeletons are split evenly between adult men and children, so 5 adult men and 5 children.
4) An adult woman has 20 bones in their body.
5) An adult man has 5 more bones than an adult woman, so 20 + 5 = 25 bones.
6) A child has half as many bones as an adult woman, so 20 / 2 = 10 bones.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bones in the graveyard:
* 10 adult women x 20 bones = 200 bones
* 5 adult men x 25 bones = 125 bones
* 5 children x 10 bones = 50 bones

Adding these up:
200 + 125 + 50 = 375 bones

Answer: 375
