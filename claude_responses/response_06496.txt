To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces of mail the post office handles in six months.

Given information:
- The post office receives 60 letters and 20 packages per day.
- All the months have 30 days.
- We need to find the total number of pieces of mail in six months.

Step 1: Find the total number of pieces of mail per day.
Number of letters per day + Number of packages per day = Total pieces of mail per day
60 + 20 = 80 pieces of mail per day

Step 2: Find the total number of pieces of mail in one month.
Total pieces of mail per day × Number of days in a month = Total pieces of mail in one month
80 × 30 = 2,400 pieces of mail in one month

Step 3: Find the total number of pieces of mail in six months.
Total pieces of mail in one month × Number of months = Total pieces of mail in six months
2,400 × 6 = 14,400 pieces of mail in six months

Answer: 14,400
