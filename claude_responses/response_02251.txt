Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom spends $17 on gas each month.
2) Tom mows 3 lawns each month, charging $12 per lawn.
3) So his total revenue from mowing lawns is: 3 lawns x $12 per lawn = $36.
4) Tom also made an extra $10 from pulling weeds.
5) To calculate his profit, we need to subtract his expenses from his total revenue:
   Total Revenue = $36 (from mowing lawns) + $10 (from pulling weeds) = $46
   Expenses = $17 (gas)
   Profit = Total Revenue - Expenses = $46 - $17 = $29

Answer: $29
