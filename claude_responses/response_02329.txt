Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Archie needs to take antibiotics three times a day.
2) He needs to take the antibiotics for a week, which is 7 days.
3) So the total number of times he needs to take the antibiotics is 3 times a day x 7 days = 21 times.
4) Each antibiotic costs $3.
5) To calculate the total cost, we multiply the number of times he needs to take the antibiotics (21) by the cost per antibiotic ($3).
6) 21 x $3 = $63.

Answer: $63
