Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Josette bought 3 bottles of mineral water for €1.50
* This means the cost of 3 bottles is €1.50
* To find the cost of 4 bottles, we need to find the cost of 1 bottle and then multiply it by 4
* The cost of 1 bottle is €1.50 / 3 = €0.50
* The cost of 4 bottles is 4 * €0.50 = €2.00
