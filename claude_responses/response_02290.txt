Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Victor has 8 flower stickers
* He has 2 fewer animal stickers than flower stickers
* To find the number of animal stickers, we take the number of flower stickers (8) and subtract 2:
* Number of animal stickers = 8 - 2 = 6
* To find the total number of stickers, we add the number of flower stickers and the number of animal stickers:
* Total number of stickers = 8 + 6 = 14

Answer: 14
