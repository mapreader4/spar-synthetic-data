Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. The original price of the television is $480.
2. The seller gives a 5% discount, which means the final price of the television is 95% of the original price.
   * 95% of $480 = 0.95 * $480 = $456
3. Isabelle's parents paid a first installment of $150.
4. The remaining amount to be paid is the final price minus the first installment:
   * $456 - $150 = $306
5. The remaining amount of $306 will be paid in 3 monthly installments.
   * $306 / 3 = $102

Answer: $102
