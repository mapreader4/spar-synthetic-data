Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We are given that 60% of the students at the school are girls.
2) We are also given that the number of boys is 300.
3) To find the number of girls, we need to find the total number of students and then calculate 60% of that.
4) The total number of students is the number of girls plus the number of boys.
5) Since the number of boys is 300, and they represent 40% of the total (100% - 60% = 40%), we can calculate the total number of students as:
300 / 0.4 = 750 total students
6) Now, to find the number of girls, we take 60% of the total number of students:
0.6 * 750 = 450 girls
Answer: 450
