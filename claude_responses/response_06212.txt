Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Daragh had 20 stuffed bears initially.
2) She took out her favorite 8 bears, leaving her with 20 - 8 = 12 bears.
3) She then divided the remaining 12 bears equally among her 3 sisters.
4) Each sister would receive 12 / 3 = 4 bears.
5) Eden, Daragh's youngest sister, already had 10 bears.
6) Now, Eden has the 4 bears that Daragh gave her, plus the 10 bears she already had.
7) Therefore, Eden now has 10 + 4 = 14 stuffed bears.

Answer: 14
