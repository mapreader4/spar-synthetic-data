Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The hallway is 16m long.
2) The father and son are walking towards each other from opposite ends of the hallway.
3) The father is walking three times as fast as the son.
4) Let's say the father's speed is x m/s and the son's speed is y m/s.
5) Since the father is walking three times as fast as the son, we can say that x = 3y.
6) The father and son will meet when the distance the father has walked is equal to the distance the son has walked.
7) The father has walked x * t meters, where t is the time it takes them to meet.
8) The son has walked y * t meters, where t is the time it takes them to meet.
9) Since the father and son meet at the same point, we can say that x * t = 16 - y * t.
10) Substituting x = 3y, we get 3y * t = 16 - y * t.
11) Solving for t, we get t = 4 seconds.
12) The distance the father has walked is x * t = 3y * 4 = 12 meters.
13) Therefore, they will meet 12 meters from the father's end of the hallway.

Answer: 12
