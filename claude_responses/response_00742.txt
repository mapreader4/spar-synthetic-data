Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day without the lawnmower
* After buying the lawnmower, his productivity increased by 50%
* 50% of 8 yards is 4 yards
* So, with the lawnmower, Brendan can now cut 8 + 4 = 12 yards per day
* In a week, there are 7 days
* So, the total number of yards Brendan can cut in a week is 12 yards per day x 7 days = 84 yards

Answer: 84
