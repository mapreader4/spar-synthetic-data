Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Samantha, Aira, and Joe each received 6 rubber bands after dividing them equally.
2) Samantha had 5 more bands than Aira.
3) Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe.
4) Let's call the number of bands Aira had as "x".
5) Since Samantha had 5 more bands than Aira, Samantha had "x + 5" bands.
6) Since Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe, Joe had "x + 1" bands.
7) Since they each received 6 bands, we can set up an equation:
   x + (x + 5) + (x + 1) = 6 + 6 + 6
8) Simplifying, we get:
   3x + 6 = 18
9) Solving for x, we get:
   3x = 12
   x = 4
