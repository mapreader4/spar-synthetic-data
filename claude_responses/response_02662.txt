Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each student has 3 journal-writing sessions per week
* In each session, each student writes 4 pages
* We want to know how many journal pages each student will write in 6 weeks

To calculate the total number of pages each student will write in 6 weeks, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of pages each student writes per week
2. Multiply the number of pages per week by the number of weeks

Step 1: Calculating the number of pages each student writes per week
* Each student has 3 journal-writing sessions per week
* In each session, each student writes 4 pages
* So, each student writes 3 sessions x 4 pages = 12 pages per week

Step 2: Multiplying the number of pages per week by the number of weeks
* Each student writes 12 pages per week
* There are 6 weeks
* So, each student will write 12 pages per week x 6 weeks = 72 pages in 6 weeks

Answer: 72
