Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 red chairs
* There are 4 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs
* To find the number of yellow chairs, we multiply the number of red chairs (5) by 4:
  * 5 x 4 = 20 yellow chairs
* There are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs
* To find the number of blue chairs, we subtract 2 from the number of yellow chairs:
  * 20 - 2 = 18 blue chairs
* Now we can add up the total number of chairs:
  * 5 red chairs + 20 yellow chairs + 18 blue chairs = 43 chairs

Answer: 43
