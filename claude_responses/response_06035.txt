Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cherry charges $2.50 for a 3-5 kilograms cargo
* She delivers four 5 kilograms cargo per day
* So for the four 5 kilograms cargo, she earns 4 * $2.50 = $10 per day
* Cherry charges $4 for a 6-8 kilograms cargo
* She delivers two 8 kilograms cargo per day
* So for the two 8 kilograms cargo, she earns 2 * $4 = $8 per day
* In total, she earns $10 + $8 = $18 per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* So in a week, she will earn 7 * $18 = $126

Answer: $126
