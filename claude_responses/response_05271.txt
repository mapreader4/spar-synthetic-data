Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The duck takes 40 days to fly to the south during winter
* It takes the duck twice as much time to fly to the north during summer, which is 2 x 40 = 80 days
* The duck takes 60 days to travel to the East during spring

Now, we can add up the total number of days the duck is flying during these seasons:
* 40 days (winter) + 80 days (summer) + 60 days (spring) = 180 days

Answer: 180 days
