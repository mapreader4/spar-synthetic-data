Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carl's goal is to sell 96 cupcakes in 2 days.
2) Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront.
3) To find the number of cupcakes Carl must sell per day, we need to first find the total number of cupcakes he needs to sell.
4) The total number of cupcakes he needs to sell is 96 + 24 = 120 cupcakes.
5) Since he has 2 days to sell the cupcakes, he must sell 120 / 2 = 60 cupcakes per day.

Answer: 60
