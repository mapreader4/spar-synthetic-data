Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each case has 3 packs of muffins
* Each pack has 4 muffins
* So each case has 3 * 4 = 12 muffins
* Nora is selling each muffin for $2
* So the revenue from each case is 12 * $2 = $24
* Nora needs to raise $120 for the school trip
* To calculate how many cases she needs to sell, we divide the total amount needed ($120) by the revenue per case ($24)
* $120 / $24 = 5 cases

Answer: 5 cases
