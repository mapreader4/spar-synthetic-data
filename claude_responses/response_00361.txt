Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, the Skipper traveled 20 hours at 30 km/h in an eastward direction
* 20 hours x 30 km/h = 600 km traveled in the eastward direction
* The ship was then at the halfway point to the destination
* After the storm, the Skipper discovered the ship was only one-third of the way to the destination
* This means the ship was blown back by two-thirds of the original distance traveled
* Two-thirds of 600 km is 400 km

Answer: 400 km
