Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel did
* Let's represent Gabriel's erasers as x
* Then Celine's erasers would be 2x
* Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine did
* So Julian's erasers would be 2(2x) = 4x
* The total number of erasers collected is 35
* So we can write the equation: x + 2x + 4x = 35
* Simplifying, we get: 7x = 35
* Dividing both sides by 7, we get: x = 5
* Since Celine collected 2x erasers, and x = 5, Celine collected 2(5) = 10 erasers.
