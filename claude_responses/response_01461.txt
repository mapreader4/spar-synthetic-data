Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The chalkboard is 3 feet wide.
2) The chalkboard is 2 times as long as it is wide. 
3) To find the length of the chalkboard, we multiply the width by 2:
   * Width = 3 feet
   * Length = 3 feet x 2 = 6 feet
4) To find the area of the chalkboard, we multiply the length by the width:
   * Area = Length x Width
   * Area = 6 feet x 3 feet = 18 square feet

Answer: 18
