Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Eliza buys 200 ornamental rings to sell in their local shop, which is twice the number of the remaining stock. So, the remaining stock before the 200 rings were bought is 100 rings.
2) After selling 3/4 of the total stock, the remaining stock is 1/4 of the original 300 rings, which is 75 rings.
3) Eliza's mother then buys 300 more ornamental rings, bringing the total stock to 375 rings.
4) After three days, Eliza's mother sells 150 rings, leaving 225 rings in the store.

Answer: 225
