Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 40 students in Giorgio's class.
2) Giorgio plans to make 2 cookies per student.
3) So the total number of cookies Giorgio plans to make is 40 students * 2 cookies per student = 80 cookies.
4) 10% of the 40 students want oatmeal raisin cookies.
5) 10% of 40 is 4 students.
6) Since Giorgio plans to make 2 cookies per student, the number of oatmeal raisin cookies he will make is 4 students * 2 cookies per student = 8 oatmeal raisin cookies.

Answer: 8
