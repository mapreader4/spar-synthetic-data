Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jack has a grove with 4 trees by 5 trees, so the total number of trees is 4 x 5 = 20 trees.
2) It takes 6 minutes to clean each tree.
3) With help, it only takes half as long, so it takes 3 minutes to clean each tree.
4) To find the total time spent cleaning the trees, we multiply the number of trees (20) by the time it takes to clean each tree (3 minutes):
20 trees x 3 minutes/tree = 60 minutes
5) To convert this to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60:
60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour

Answer: 1 hour
