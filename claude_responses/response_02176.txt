Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maiya has two sisters
* The first sister is twice as old as Maiya
* The first sister is 1 year younger than Maiya
* The average age of the three sisters is 5

Let's call Maiya's age "x".
* The first sister's age is 2x, since she is twice as old as Maiya.
* The first sister is 1 year younger than Maiya, so her age is x - 1.

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x:
* (x + (x - 1) + 2x) / 3 = 5
* (4x - 1) / 3 = 5
* 4x - 1 = 15
* 4x = 16
* x = 4

Therefore, Maiya is 4 years old.
