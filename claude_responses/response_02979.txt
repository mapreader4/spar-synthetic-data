Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve
* Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck
* There are 27 guitars altogether

Let's start by assigning variables:
* Let x = the number of guitars Steve has
* Then Barbeck has 2x guitars
* And Davey has 3(2x) = 6x guitars

Now, we know the total number of guitars is 27, so we can set up an equation:
x + 2x + 6x = 27
9x = 27
x = 3

So Steve has 3 guitars, Barbeck has 2(3) = 6 guitars, and Davey has 6(3) = 18 guitars.

Answer: 18
