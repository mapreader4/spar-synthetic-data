Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cary walks 3 miles round-trip to the grocery store.
2) At the grocery store, he buys and eats a candy bar with 200 calories.
3) Cary burns 150 calories per mile walked.
4) To calculate the total calories burned, we multiply the number of miles walked (6 miles) by the number of calories burned per mile (150 calories):
   6 miles x 150 calories/mile = 900 calories burned
5) To calculate the net calorie deficit, we subtract the calories consumed (200 calories) from the calories burned (900 calories):
   900 calories burned - 200 calories consumed = 700 calories deficit

Answer: 700
