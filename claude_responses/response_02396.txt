Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carrie adds 6 12-oz cans of Mountain Dew, which is 6 * 12 = 72 oz of Mountain Dew
* She also adds 28 oz of ice
* And a 40 oz bottle of fruit juice
* So the total amount of punch is 72 oz + 28 oz + 40 oz = 140 oz
* Each serving of punch is 10 oz
* To find the number of 10 oz servings, we divide the total amount of punch (140 oz) by the serving size (10 oz)
* 140 oz / 10 oz per serving = 14 servings

Answer: 14
