Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Denny currently has 100,000 followers
* He gains 1,000 new followers every day
* In a year, there are 365 days
* So in a year, he will gain 1,000 * 365 = 365,000 new followers
* However, 20,000 people unfollowed him in that year
* So the net change in followers is 365,000 - 20,000 = 345,000 new followers
* Therefore, the total number of followers Denny will have is his original 100,000 plus the 345,000 new followers, which is:

Answer: 445,000
