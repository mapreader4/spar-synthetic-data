Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The restaurant has a total of 36 different dishes available
* Mango salsa is featured in 3 of the dishes
* Fresh mangoes are featured in 1/6 of the dishes (which is 6 dishes)
* Mango jelly is featured in 1 dish
* Oliver can pick out the mangoes from 2 of the dishes with fresh mangoes

First, let's calculate the total number of dishes that contain mangoes:
* Mango salsa: 3 dishes
* Fresh mangoes: 6 dishes
* Mango jelly: 1 dish
* Total dishes with mangoes: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 dishes

Now, we can subtract the 2 dishes that Oliver can pick the mangoes out of, leaving 8 dishes that Oliver cannot eat.

Finally, we can subtract the 8 dishes with mangoes from the total of 36 dishes to get the number of dishes left for Oliver:
* 36 - 8 = 28 dishes

Answer: 28
