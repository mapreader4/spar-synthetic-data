Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The mother bought a box of 27 sweets
* She kept 1/3 of the sweets for herself
* The remaining 2/3 of the sweets were divided between her 3 children
* The eldest child got 8 sweets
* The youngest child got half as many sweets as the eldest child

First, let's calculate how many sweets the mother kept for herself:
* 1/3 of 27 sweets = 9 sweets

Now, let's calculate how many sweets were left for the 3 children:
* 2/3 of 27 sweets = 18 sweets

The eldest child got 8 sweets, and the youngest child got half as many, which is 4 sweets.

Therefore, the second child must have gotten the remaining sweets:
* 18 sweets - 8 sweets - 4 sweets = 6 sweets

Answer: 6
