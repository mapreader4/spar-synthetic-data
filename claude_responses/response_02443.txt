Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary has 3 children with her
* Tickets cost $2 for adults and $1 for children
* Mary pays with a $20 bill

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets:
* 1 adult ticket at $2 = $2
* 3 children tickets at $1 each = $3
* Total cost of tickets = $2 + $3 = $5

Now, we need to calculate the change Mary will receive:
* Mary paid with a $20 bill
* The total cost of the tickets is $5
* The change Mary will receive is $20 - $5 = $15
