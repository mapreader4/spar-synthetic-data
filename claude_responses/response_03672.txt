Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Salem created a poem with 20 stanzas
* Each stanza has 10 lines
* Each line has 8 words

To find the total number of words in the poem, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of lines in the poem
2. Multiply the total number of lines by the number of words per line

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lines in the poem
* There are 20 stanzas
* Each stanza has 10 lines
* Total number of lines = 20 stanzas x 10 lines per stanza = 200 lines

Step 2: Multiply the total number of lines by the number of words per line
* Each line has 8 words
* Total number of words = 200 lines x 8 words per line = 1,600 words

Answer: 1,600
