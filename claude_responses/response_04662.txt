Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Zach is saving up to buy a bike that costs $100
* His weekly allowance is $5
* His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn
* His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son
* He has already saved up $65
* He'll receive his allowance on Friday
* He's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn

First, let's calculate how much money he will earn this week:
* Allowance: $5
* Mowing the lawn: $10
* Babysitting (2 hours at $7/hour): $14

Total earned this week: $5 + $10 + $14 = $29

Now, let's add up the total amount of money he has:
* Saved up already: $65
* Earned this week: $29

Total amount of money he has: $65 + $29 = $94

Finally, to calculate how much more he needs to earn:
* Bike cost: $100
* Total amount of money he has: $94

Amount more he needs to earn: $100 - $94 = $6

Answer: $6
