Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hayden eats 1 oz of mixed nuts as an evening snack.
2) The bag of mixed nuts costs $25.00 and holds 40 oz of nuts.
3) There is a $5.00 coupon for this item.
4) To find the cost per serving after the coupon is applied, we need to:
   a) Subtract the $5.00 coupon from the $25.00 bag price to get the final price: $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00
   b) Divide the final price ($20.00) by the total number of servings (40 oz) to get the cost per serving: $20.00 / 40 oz = $0.50 per oz
   c) Convert the cost per serving from dollars to cents: $0.50 per oz x 100 cents/dollar = 50 cents per serving.

Answer: 50 cents
