Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matias sold 7 books on Tuesday
* On Wednesday, he sold three times as many books as on Tuesday
* So, on Wednesday, he sold 3 x 7 = 21 books
* On Thursday, the sales from Wednesday were tripled
* So, on Thursday, he sold 3 x 21 = 63 books

Now, to find the total number of books sold during these three days, we add up the sales from each day:
* Tuesday: 7 books
* Wednesday: 21 books
* Thursday: 63 books
* Total books sold = 7 + 21 + 63 = 91 books

Answer: 91
