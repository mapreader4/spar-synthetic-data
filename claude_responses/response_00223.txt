Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Andy bought:
  - 1 can of soda at $1
  - 2 hamburgers at $2 each, so 2 x $2 = $4
* So Andy's total spend is $1 + $4 = $5
* Bob also spent the same amount as Andy, which is $5
* Bob bought:
  - 2 sandwiches at $3 each, so 2 x $3 = $6
  - 1 can of fruit drink
* So the cost of Bob's fruit drink must be the remaining amount to make up the $5 total, which is $5 - $6 = -$1
* However, the cost of the fruit drink cannot be negative, so we can conclude that the cost of Bob's fruit drink must be $1.

Answer: $1
