To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pages read by each person and then add them together to get the total number of pages read.

Given information:
- Rene can read 30 pages in 60 minutes.
- Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes.
- Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes.
- They have been reading for 240 minutes.

Step 1: Find the number of pages read by Rene.
Rene's reading rate = 30 pages / 60 minutes = 0.5 pages/minute
Rene's total pages read = 0.5 pages/minute × 240 minutes = 120 pages

Step 2: Find the number of pages read by Lulu.
Lulu's reading rate = 27 pages / 60 minutes = 0.45 pages/minute
Lulu's total pages read = 0.45 pages/minute × 240 minutes = 108 pages

Step 3: Find the number of pages read by Cherry.
Cherry's reading rate = 25 pages / 60 minutes = 0.417 pages/minute
Cherry's total pages read = 0.417 pages/minute × 240 minutes = 100 pages

Step 4: Find the total number of pages read.
Total pages read = Rene's pages + Lulu's pages + Cherry's pages
Total pages read = 120 + 108 + 100 = 328 pages

Answer: 328 pages
