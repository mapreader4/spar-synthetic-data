Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Amanda is replacing 18 cabinet knobs, which cost $2.50 each.
2) To calculate the total cost of the cabinet knobs, we multiply the number of knobs (18) by the cost per knob ($2.50):
   18 knobs x $2.50 per knob = $45.00
3) Amanda is also replacing 8 drawer pulls, which cost $4.00 each.
4) To calculate the total cost of the drawer pulls, we multiply the number of pulls (8) by the cost per pull ($4.00):
   8 pulls x $4.00 per pull = $32.00
5) To get the total cost of the kitchen upgrade, we add the cost of the cabinet knobs and the drawer pulls:
   $45.00 + $32.00 = $77.00

Answer: $77
