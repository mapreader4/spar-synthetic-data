Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell.
2) This means that the number of times he rings the small bell is 4 times 1/3 of the number of times he rings the big bell.
3) Let's call the number of times he rings the big bell "x".
4) Then the number of times he rings the small bell is 4 * (1/3)x = (4/3)x.
5) The total number of times he rings both bells is 52.
6) So the equation is: x + (4/3)x = 52
7) Solving for x, we get: (7/3)x = 52
8) x = 52 * (3/7) = 22.29
9) Since we are looking for the number of times he rings the big bell, and the number of times must be an integer, the answer is:

Answer: 22
