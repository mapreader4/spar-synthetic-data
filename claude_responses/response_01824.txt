Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Foster Farms donated 45 dressed chickens
* American Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chickens donated by Foster Farms
* Hormel donated three times the number of dressed chickens that Foster Farms donated
* Boudin Butchers donated one-third of the number of dressed chickens that Hormel donated
* Del Monte Foods donated 30 fewer bottles of water than American Summits

First, let's calculate the number of dressed chickens donated:
* Foster Farms: 45 dressed chickens
* Hormel: 3 x 45 = 135 dressed chickens
* Boudin Butchers: 135 / 3 = 45 dressed chickens

Next, let's calculate the number of bottles of water donated:
* American Summits: 2 x 45 = 90 bottles of water
* Del Monte Foods: 90 - 30 = 60 bottles of water

Now, we can add up all the food items donated:
* 45 + 135 + 45 + 90 + 60 = 375 food items

Answer: 375
