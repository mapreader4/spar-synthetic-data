Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes for a birthday party.
2) She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each, and the other half with 2 candles each.
3) So, for the first half of the cupcakes, she needs 1 candle per cupcake, which is 12 candles.
4) For the second half of the cupcakes, she needs 2 candles per cupcake, which is 24 candles.
5) In total, she needs 12 + 24 = 36 candles.
6) She currently has 30 candles.
7) Therefore, the additional candles she needs is 36 - 30 = 6 candles.
