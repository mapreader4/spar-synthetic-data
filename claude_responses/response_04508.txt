Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The video initially got 3000 likes
* The video initially got 100 more than half as many dislikes as likes
* To find the initial number of dislikes, we first find half of the number of likes:
    - 3000 / 2 = 1500
* Then we add 100 to that to get the initial number of dislikes:
    - 1500 + 100 = 1600
* The question states that the video then gets 1000 more dislikes
* So the new total number of dislikes is:
    - 1600 + 1000 = 2600
* The question also states that the video gets 0 more likes
* So the total number of likes is still 3000

Answer: 2600
