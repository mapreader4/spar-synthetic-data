Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each person needs 1/2 a gallon of fresh water per day
* There are 6 people in the family
* So the total amount of fresh water needed per day for the family is:
  * 6 people x 1/2 gallon per person = 3 gallons
* It costs $1 to purify 1 gallon of fresh water
* Therefore, the total cost for the family's fresh water for the day is:
  * 3 gallons x $1 per gallon = $3

Answer: $3
