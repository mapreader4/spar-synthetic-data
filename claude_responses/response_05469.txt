Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Robby sets aside 9 brown M&M's in the first bag
* He sets aside 12 brown M&M's in the second bag
* In the third and fourth bags, there are 8 brown M&M's that he doesn't eat
* In the fifth bag, there are 3 brown M&M's that he doesn't eat

To calculate the average number of brown M&M's in a bag, we need to add up the total number of brown M&M's he didn't eat and divide by the number of bags.

Total brown M&M's not eaten:
* 9 + 12 + 8 + 8 + 3 = 40

Number of bags:
* 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5 bags

Average number of brown M&M's per bag:
* 40 / 5 = 8

Answer: 8
