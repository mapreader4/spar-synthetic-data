Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Elizabeth starts with 10 reusable water bottles
* She loses 2 water bottles at school, so she now has 10 - 2 = 8 water bottles
* Someone steals 1 of her water bottles at dance practice, so she now has 8 - 1 = 7 water bottles
* To avoid future theft, Elizabeth places 3 stickers on each of her remaining 7 water bottles

To calculate the total number of stickers used:
* Elizabeth places 3 stickers on each of her 7 remaining water bottles
* 3 stickers per bottle x 7 bottles = 21 stickers

Answer: 21
