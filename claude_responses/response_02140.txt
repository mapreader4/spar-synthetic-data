Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James takes 2 Tylenol tablets every 6 hours
* Each Tylenol tablet is 375 mg
* To find the total mg he takes in a day, we need to calculate the total number of Tylenol tablets he takes in a day and multiply that by the mg per tablet.

First, let's calculate the number of times he takes Tylenol in a day:
* There are 24 hours in a day
* He takes Tylenol every 6 hours
* 24 hours / 6 hours = 4 times per day

Now, let's calculate the total number of Tylenol tablets he takes in a day:
* 2 tablets per dose x 4 doses per day = 8 tablets per day

Finally, let's calculate the total mg of Tylenol he takes in a day:
* 8 tablets per day x 375 mg per tablet = 3,000 mg per day

Answer: 3,000 mg
