Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Margo donated $4300 to Jayden's fundraising campaign.
2) Julie donated $4700 to Jayden's fundraising campaign.
3) To find the difference in the amount they contributed, we subtract Margo's donation from Julie's donation:
$4700 - $4300 = $400
4) To find half the difference, we divide $400 by 2:
$400 / 2 = $200
Answer: 200
