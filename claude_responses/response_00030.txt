Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each personal pan pizza is cut into 4 pieces
* Bill and Dale each eat 50% of their pizzas
* Ann and Cate each eat 75% of their pizzas

First, let's calculate how many pieces each person has left uneaten:
* Bill and Dale each have 50% of their 4 pieces left, which is 2 pieces each
* Ann and Cate each have 25% of their 4 pieces left, which is 1 piece each

Now, we add up the total number of pieces left uneaten:
* 2 pieces (Bill) + 2 pieces (Dale) + 1 piece (Ann) + 1 piece (Cate) = 6 pieces

Answer: 6
