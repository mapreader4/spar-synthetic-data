Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jennifer has 10 pears
* Jennifer has 20 oranges
* Jennifer has twice as many apples as pears, so she has 2 x 10 = 20 apples
* Jennifer gives her sister 2 of each fruit, so she gives away:
  - 2 pears
  - 2 oranges
  - 2 apples
* So the total number of fruits she gives away is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
* Originally, Jennifer had:
  - 10 pears
  - 20 oranges 
  - 20 apples
* So the total number of fruits she had originally was 10 + 20 + 20 = 50
* After giving away 6 fruits, the number of fruits she has left is 50 - 6 = 44

Answer: 44
