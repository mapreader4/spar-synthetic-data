Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Max has 8 children
* Each of his children has the same number of children as he does, except for 2 who have 5 children each
* So, 6 of Max's children have 8 children each, and 2 of Max's children have 5 children each
* To calculate the total number of grandchildren:
* 6 children with 8 children each: 6 * 8 = 48 grandchildren
* 2 children with 5 children each: 2 * 5 = 10 grandchildren
* Total grandchildren = 48 + 10 = 58

Answer: 58
