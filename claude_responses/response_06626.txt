Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James prints out 2 books
* Each book is 600 pages long
* He prints out double-sided, which means 4 pages per sheet of paper
* To calculate the total number of sheets of paper used:
  * Total pages = 2 books x 600 pages per book = 1200 pages
  * Since he prints 4 pages per sheet of paper, we divide the total pages by 4 to get the number of sheets:
  * 1200 pages / 4 pages per sheet = 300 sheets of paper

Answer: 300
