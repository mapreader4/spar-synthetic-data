Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The candy bars cost $2 each.
2) Marvin sold 35 candy bars in total.
3) Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin.
   * Marvin sold 35 candy bars, so Tina sold 3 x 35 = 105 candy bars.
4) To calculate the money made by each person:
   * Marvin made: 35 candy bars x $2 per candy bar = $70
   * Tina made: 105 candy bars x $2 per candy bar = $210
5) To calculate the difference in money made:
   * Tina made $210, Marvin made $70
   * $210 - $70 = $140

Answer: $140
