Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cheryl has thrice as many colored pencils as Cyrus
* Madeline has 63 colored pencils
* Madeline has only half of what Cheryl has

First, let's find out how many colored pencils Cheryl has. Since Madeline has half of what Cheryl has, we can use this to solve for Cheryl's amount:
* Madeline has 63 colored pencils
* Madeline has half of what Cheryl has
* So, Cheryl has 2 * 63 = 126 colored pencils

Now, we know that Cheryl has thrice as many colored pencils as Cyrus. So, we can solve for Cyrus's amount:
* Cheryl has 126 colored pencils
* Cheryl has thrice as many as Cyrus
* So, Cyrus has 126 / 3 = 42 colored pencils

Now, we can add up the total number of colored pencils that the three of them have:
* Cheryl has 126 colored pencils
* Madeline has 63 colored pencils
* Cyrus has 42 colored pencils
* Total = 126 + 63 + 42 = 231 colored pencils

Answer: 231
