Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenine can sharpen a pencil 5 times before it runs out.
2) She needs to sharpen a pencil for every 1.5 hours of use.
3) She already has 10 pencils.
4) She needs to write for 105 hours.
5) A new pencil costs $2.

To calculate how many pencils she needs in total:
* Each pencil can be used for 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 hours
* So, 105 hours / 7.5 hours per pencil = 14 pencils needed in total

Now, to calculate how many additional pencils she needs to buy:
* She already has 10 pencils
* So, she needs to buy 14 - 10 = 4 more pencils

Finally, to calculate the cost:
* Each new pencil costs $2
* She needs to buy 4 more pencils
* So, the total cost is 4 * $2 = $8

Answer: $8
