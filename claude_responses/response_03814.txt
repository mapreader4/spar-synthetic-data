Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Andre caught 8 ladybugs
* On Tuesday, Andre caught 5 ladybugs
* Each ladybug has 6 dots
* To find the total number of dots, we need to:
  1. Calculate the total number of ladybugs caught
  2. Multiply the total number of ladybugs by the number of dots per ladybug

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ladybugs caught
* Monday: 8 ladybugs
* Tuesday: 5 ladybugs
* Total ladybugs caught = 8 + 5 = 13 ladybugs

Step 2: Multiply the total number of ladybugs by the number of dots per ladybug
* Each ladybug has 6 dots
* Total dots = 13 ladybugs x 6 dots/ladybug = 78 dots

Answer: 78
