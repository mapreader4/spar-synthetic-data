Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Susy's followers:
* Start of year: 100 followers
* Week 1: Gained 40 new followers, so now has 100 + 40 = 140 followers
* Week 2: Gained half of 40, which is 20 new followers, so now has 140 + 20 = 160 followers
* Week 3: Gained half of 20, which is 10 new followers, so now has 160 + 10 = 170 followers

Sarah's followers:
* Start of year: 50 followers
* Week 1: Gained 90 new followers, so now has 50 + 90 = 140 followers
* Week 2: Gained a third of 90, which is 30 new followers, so now has 140 + 30 = 170 followers
* Week 3: Gained a third of 30, which is 10 new followers, so now has 170 + 10 = 180 followers

After three weeks, the girl with the most total followers is Sarah, with 180 followers.
