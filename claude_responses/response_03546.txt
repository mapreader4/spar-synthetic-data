Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* We know that one Burmese python can eat one 50-cm alligator per week.
* We need to find how many Burmese pythons it would take to eat 15 alligators in 3 weeks.
* In 3 weeks, one Burmese python can eat 3 alligators (1 per week).
* To eat 15 alligators in 3 weeks, we need to divide 15 alligators by the 3 alligators that one python can eat in 3 weeks.
* 15 alligators / 3 alligators per python = 5 Burmese pythons.

Answer: 5
