Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Megan has 30 clients total
* 7 clients need vegan meals
* 8 clients need kosher meals
* 3 clients need meals that are both vegan and kosher
* To find the number of meals that are neither kosher nor vegan, we need to subtract the number of vegan and kosher meals from the total number of meals.

First, let's find the total number of vegan and kosher meals:
* Vegan meals: 7
* Kosher meals: 8
* Meals that are both vegan and kosher: 3
* To avoid double-counting, we subtract the 3 meals that are both vegan and kosher from the total:
* Total vegan and kosher meals = 7 + 8 - 3 = 12

Now, we can find the number of meals that are neither kosher nor vegan:
* Total meals = 30
* Meals that are vegan and/or kosher = 12
* Meals that are neither kosher nor vegan = 30 - 12 = 18

Answer: 18
