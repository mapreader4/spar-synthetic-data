Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The movie is 1.5 hours long
* The movie is replayed 6 times in one day
* There is a 20-minute advertisement before the start of the movie

First, we need to calculate the total time for the 6 movie showings:
* 6 showings x 1.5 hours per showing = 9 hours

Next, we need to add the time for the advertisements:
* 6 showings x 20 minutes per showing = 120 minutes = 2 hours

Finally, we add the time for the movies and the advertisements to get the total time the movie theater operates each day:
* 9 hours + 2 hours = 11 hours

Answer: 11 hours
