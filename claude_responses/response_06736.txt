Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Georgia sent a dozen carnations to each of her 5 teachers
* Each dozen of carnations costs $4.00
* So for the 5 teachers, she spent: 5 * $4.00 = $20.00
* Georgia also bought one carnation for each of her 14 friends
* Each carnation costs $0.50
* So for the 14 friends, she spent: 14 * $0.50 = $7.00
* To calculate the total amount of money Georgia spent:
* Total spent = $20.00 (for the teachers) + $7.00 (for the friends)
* Total spent = $20.00 + $7.00 = $27.00

Answer: $27.00
