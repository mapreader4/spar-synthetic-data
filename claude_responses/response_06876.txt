Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Selena got a tip of $99
* She had 2 steak meals that cost $24 each, so that's 2 x $24 = $48
* She ordered 2 types of burgers that cost $3.5 each, so that's 2 x $3.5 = $7
* She also ordered 3 cups of ice cream that cost $2 each, so that's 3 x $2 = $6
* To calculate the total amount she spent, we add up the costs:
$48 + $7 + $6 = $61
* To calculate how much money she will be left with, we take the tip amount ($99) and subtract the total amount she spent ($61):
$99 - $61 = $38
Answer: $38
