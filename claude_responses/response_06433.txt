Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There are 48 crayons in the box initially.
2) Kiley takes 1/4 of the crayons away. To calculate this, we take 1/4 of 48, which is 12. So, 12 crayons are taken away, leaving 48 - 12 = 36 crayons remaining.
3) Joe then takes away half of the remaining crayons. To calculate this, we take 1/2 of 36, which is 18. So, 18 crayons are taken away, leaving 36 - 18 = 18 crayons remaining.

Answer: 18
