Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Kirill is 14 centimeters shorter than his brother.
2) Together, their heights equal 112 centimeters.
3) Let's call Kirill's height x and his brother's height y.
4) We know that y = x + 14, since Kirill is 14 centimeters shorter than his brother.
5) We also know that x + y = 112, since their combined height is 112 centimeters.
6) Substituting y = x + 14 into the second equation, we get:
x + (x + 14) = 112
2x + 14 = 112
2x = 98
x = 49
7) Therefore, Kirill's height is 49 centimeters.

Answer: 49
