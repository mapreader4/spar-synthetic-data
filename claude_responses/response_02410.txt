Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Freddy is 2 years younger than Stephanie.
2) Stephanie is 4 times as old as Job.
3) Job is 5 years old.

First, let's find Stephanie's age:
* Stephanie is 4 times as old as Job
* Job is 5 years old
* Therefore, Stephanie is 4 x 5 = 20 years old

Now, let's find Freddy's age:
* Freddy is 2 years younger than Stephanie
* Stephanie is 20 years old
* Therefore, Freddy is 20 - 2 = 18 years old

Answer: 18
