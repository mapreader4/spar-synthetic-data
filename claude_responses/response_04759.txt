Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James' old barbell cost $250
* The new barbell costs 30% more than the old one
* To calculate the 30% increase, we take 30% of $250:
* 30% of $250 = 0.30 x $250 = $75
* So the new barbell costs $250 + $75 = $325
* Therefore, the new barbell cost James $325.

Answer: 325
