Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aunt May milks her cows twice a day
* This morning she got 365 gallons of milk
* This evening she got 380 gallons of milk
* So the total amount of milk she got today is 365 + 380 = 745 gallons
* She had 15 gallons left over from yesterday
* So the total amount of milk she had was 745 + 15 = 760 gallons
* She sold 612 gallons to the local ice cream factory
* So the amount of milk she has left is 760 - 612 = 148 gallons

Answer: 148 gallons
