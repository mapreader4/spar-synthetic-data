Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Holden's current master bedroom is 309 sq ft
* Holden's current master bath is 150 sq ft
* Holden wants to add a new home office/personal gym divided space
* The new room is to be twice as large as the bedroom and bathroom combined
* To calculate the size of the new room, we first need to find the total size of the bedroom and bathroom:
* Bedroom: 309 sq ft
* Bathroom: 150 sq ft
* Total size of bedroom and bathroom: 309 + 150 = 459 sq ft
* The new room is to be twice as large as the bedroom and bathroom combined
* Twice the size of the bedroom and bathroom: 459 x 2 = 918 sq ft

Answer: 918 sq ft
