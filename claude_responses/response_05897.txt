Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Olaf initially had 150 toy cars
* Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle
* Let's call the number of toy cars the uncle gave Olaf as 'x'
* Then, Grandpa gave Olaf 2x toy cars
* Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum
* So, Mum gave Olaf 15 toy cars
* Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle
* So, the uncle gave Olaf x toy cars, and Auntie gave Olaf x+1 toy cars

Now, let's add up all the toy cars Olaf received:
* Grandpa: 2x
* Uncle: x
* Auntie: x+1
* Dad: 10
* Mum: 15

Total toy cars received = 2x + x + x+1 + 10 + 15 = 4x + 26

Adding this to Olaf's initial 150 toy cars:
* Total toy cars = 150 + 4x + 26
