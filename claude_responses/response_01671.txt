Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The river is 50 yards wide at one end
* The river's width increases by 2 yards every 10 meters along
* Rodney and Todd are rowing at a rate of 5 m/s
* We need to find how long it will take them to reach the point where the river is 80 yards wide

First, let's calculate the distance they need to row to reach the 80 yard wide point:
* The river starts at 50 yards wide and increases by 2 yards every 10 meters
* To reach 80 yards wide, the river must have increased by 30 yards (80 - 50 = 30)
* 30 yards / 2 yards per 10 meters = 150 meters

Now, we can calculate the time it takes them to row 150 meters at 5 m/s:
* 150 meters / 5 m/s = 30 seconds

Therefore, it will take Rodney and Todd 30 seconds to reach the point where the river is 80 yards wide.

Answer: 30
