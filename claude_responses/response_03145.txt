Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost to rent a sailboat is $60.
2) The cost to rent a ski boat is $80 per hour.
3) Ken rented a sailboat for 3 hours a day for 2 days.
4) The total cost for Ken to rent the sailboat would be:
   * $60 per rental x 2 days = $120
5) Aldrich rented a ski boat for 3 hours a day for 2 days.
6) The total cost for Aldrich to rent the ski boat would be:
   * $80 per hour x 3 hours per day x 2 days = $480
7) The difference in cost between Aldrich renting the ski boat and Ken renting the sailboat is:
   * $480 - $120 = $360

Answer: $360
