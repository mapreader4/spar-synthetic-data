Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In seven years, Talia will be 20 years old. This means that Talia is currently 13 years old (20 - 7 = 13).

2. Talia's mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today. This means that Talia's mom is currently 39 years old (3 x 13 = 39).

3. In three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today. This means that in three years, Talia's father will be 39 years old.

4. To find Talia's father's current age, we subtract 3 years from 39 years. 
   Talia's father's current age = 39 - 3 = 36 years old.

Answer: 36
