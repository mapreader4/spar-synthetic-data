Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cook had 300 carrots in the bucket initially.
2) Before lunch, he had used 2/5 of the carrots.
   * 2/5 of 300 = 120 carrots used before lunch.
   * Remaining carrots = 300 - 120 = 180 carrots.
3) By the end of the day, he had used 3/5 of the remaining carrots.
   * 3/5 of 180 = 108 carrots used by the end of the day.
   * Remaining carrots = 180 - 108 = 72 carrots.

Answer: 72 carrots were not used that day.
