Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Susan is planning to have 30 guests at the party
* The recipe she is making for dinner makes 2 servings per batch
* Each batch of the recipe calls for 4 potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt
* A potato costs $0.10
* A container of salt costs $2 and has 5 teaspoons

First, we need to figure out how many batches of the recipe Susan needs to make to feed 30 guests:
* 30 guests / 2 servings per batch = 15 batches

Now, we can calculate the cost of the potatoes:
* 15 batches x 4 potatoes per batch = 60 potatoes
* 60 potatoes x $0.10 per potato = $6

Next, we can calculate the cost of the salt:
* 15 batches x 1 teaspoon per batch = 15 teaspoons of salt
* 15 teaspoons / 5 teaspoons per container = 3 containers of salt
* 3 containers x $2 per container = $6

Finally, we can add the cost of the potatoes and the salt to get the total cost:
* $6 (potatoes) + $6 (salt) = $12

Answer: $12
