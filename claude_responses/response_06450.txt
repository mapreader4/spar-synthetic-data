Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Trisha's hourly pay is $15 per hour.
2) She works 40 hours per week.
3) So her weekly pay is $15 x 40 = $600 per week.
4) She works 52 weeks in a year.
5) So her annual pay is $600 x 52 = $31,200 per year.
6) 20% of her pay is withheld for taxes, unemployment insurance, and social security.
7) 20% of $31,200 is 0.2 x $31,200 = $6,240.
8) Her annual "take-home" pay is her annual pay minus the amount withheld, which is $31,200 - $6,240 = $24,960.

Answer: $24,960
