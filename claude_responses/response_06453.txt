Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each batch of guacamole requires 4 avocados
* Each batch serves about 6 people
* There will be 42 people at the party, including Allie
* To determine how many avocados Allie needs, we first need to figure out how many batches of guacamole she needs to make.
* Since each batch serves 6 people, and there will be 42 people at the party, Allie needs to make enough guacamole for 42 / 6 = 7 batches.
* Since each batch requires 4 avocados, Allie needs 7 * 4 = 28 avocados.

Answer: 28 avocados.
