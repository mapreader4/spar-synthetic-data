Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Anna originally had an unknown amount of money.
2) She spent 1/4 of her money.
3) After spending 1/4 of her money, she has $24 left.
4) Let's call the original amount of money she had 'x'.
5) She spent 1/4 of 'x', which is 1/4 * x = 0.25x.
6) The amount she has left is 'x' minus the amount she spent, which is 'x' - 0.25x = 0.75x.
7) We know that the amount she has left is $24, so 0.75x = $24.
8) Solving for 'x', we get x = $24 / 0.75 = $32.

Answer: $32.
