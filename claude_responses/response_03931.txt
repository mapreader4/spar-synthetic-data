Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On the first day:
* Gina scored 2 goals
* Tom scored 3 more goals than Gina, so Tom scored 2 + 3 = 5 goals

On the second day:
* Gina scored 2 goals less than Tom
* Tom scored 6 goals
* So Gina scored 6 - 2 = 4 goals

Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by Gina and Tom over the two days:

Gina's total goals:
* Day 1: 2 goals
* Day 2: 4 goals
* Total: 2 + 4 = 6 goals

Tom's total goals:
* Day 1: 5 goals
* Day 2: 6 goals
* Total: 5 + 6 = 11 goals

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by Gina and Tom during these two days is:

Answer: 6 + 11 = 17 goals
