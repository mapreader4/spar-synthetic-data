Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nathan played the air hockey game 2 times
* Each air hockey game costs 3 tokens
* So for the air hockey game, he used 2 x 3 = 6 tokens
* Nathan played the basketball game 4 times
* Each basketball game costs 3 tokens
* So for the basketball game, he used 4 x 3 = 12 tokens
* To find the total number of tokens he used, we add the tokens used for air hockey and basketball:
* 6 tokens + 12 tokens = 18 tokens

Answer: 18
