Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lisa has 4 children, and each child had 3 spoons when they were babies
* So the total number of spoons from the children's baby days is:
  * 4 children x 3 spoons each = 12 spoons
* Lisa also has 2 decorative spoons she created
* So the total number of spoons from the children's baby days and the decorative spoons is:
  * 12 spoons + 2 decorative spoons = 14 spoons
* The new set of cutlery has 10 large spoons and 15 teaspoons
* So the total number of spoons in the new set is:
  * 10 large spoons + 15 teaspoons = 25 spoons
* Adding the 14 spoons from the children's baby days and the decorative spoons to the 25 spoons in the new set, the total number of spoons Lisa now has is:
  * 14 spoons + 25 spoons = 39 spoons

Answer: 39
