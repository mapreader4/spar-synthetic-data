Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Harry is currently 50 years old.
2) His father is 24 years older than Harry, so his father's current age is 50 + 24 = 74 years old.
3) His mother is younger than his father by 1/25 of Harry's current age, which is 50 / 25 = 2 years.
4) Therefore, his mother's current age is 74 - 2 = 72 years old.
5) To find his mother's age when she gave birth to Harry, we subtract Harry's current age (50) from his mother's current age (72).
