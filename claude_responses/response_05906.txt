Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 members on the cross-country relay team
* Each member runs 3 km to complete their part of the race
* Ralph runs twice as much as any other member on the team to complete his part of the race

To find the total length of the race, we need to calculate the distance run by each member and then add them up.

* Each member runs 3 km
* Ralph runs twice as much, so he runs 6 km
* Total distance run by the 5 members:
    - 4 members x 3 km = 12 km
    - Ralph runs 6 km
    - Total distance = 12 km + 6 km = 18 km

Therefore, the total length of the race is:

Answer: 18 km
