Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Aaron has four times as many cows as Matthews. So, if Matthews has 60 cows, then Aaron has 4 * 60 = 240 cows.
2) Together, Aaron and Matthews have 30 more cows than Marovich. So, if Aaron has 240 cows and Matthews has 60 cows, then Marovich has 240 + 60 - 30 = 270 cows.
3) To find the total number of cows the three have altogether, we add up the number of cows each person has:
Aaron: 240 cows
Matthews: 60 cows
Marovich: 270 cows
Total: 240 + 60 + 270 = 570 cows

Answer: 570
