Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Karen has 32 quarters in her piggy bank.
2) Each quarter is worth $0.25.
3) Therefore, the total amount of money Karen has in her piggy bank is:
32 quarters x $0.25 per quarter = $8.00
4) Christopher has 64 quarters in his piggy bank.
5) Each quarter is worth $0.25.
6) Therefore, the total amount of money Christopher has in his piggy bank is:
64 quarters x $0.25 per quarter = $16.00
7) To find how much more money Christopher has, we subtract Karen's total from Christopher's total:
$16.00 - $8.00 = $8.00

Answer: $8
