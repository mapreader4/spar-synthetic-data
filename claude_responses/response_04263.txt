Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John gets $30 from his grandpa.
2) He gets 3 times that much from his grandma.
3) To calculate how much he gets from his grandma, we take the $30 he gets from his grandpa and multiply it by 3.
4) $30 x 3 = $90
5) So John gets $90 from his grandma.
6) To calculate the total amount John gets from both grandparents, we add the $30 he gets from his grandpa and the $90 he gets from his grandma.
7) $30 + $90 = $120

Answer: 120
