To find the team's average typed words per minute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up the individual typing speeds of the 5 employees:
   Rudy: 64 words per minute
   Joyce: 76 words per minute
   Gladys: 91 words per minute
   Lisa: 80 words per minute
   Mike: 89 words per minute
   Total: 64 + 76 + 91 + 80 + 89 = 400 words per minute

2. Divide the total by the number of employees to get the average:
   400 words per minute / 5 employees = 80 words per minute

Answer: 80 words per minute
