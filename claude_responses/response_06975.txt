Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Ben walked 3 km in 2 hours.
2) To find his speed, we divide the distance by the time: 3 km / 2 hours = 1.5 km/hour.
3) Now, we want to find how long it would take him to travel 12 km at the same speed.
4) To do this, we divide the distance by the speed: 12 km / 1.5 km/hour = 8 hours.
5) To convert 8 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes/hour: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Answer: 480 minutes.
