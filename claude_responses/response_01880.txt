Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run.
2) Cory can drive his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard.
3) Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour.
4) Since Cory drives his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard, and Cory drives at 12 miles per hour, Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at 6 miles per hour.
5) Since Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run, Milo can run at 3 miles per hour.
6) Milo can run for 2 hours.
7) In 2 hours, Milo can run 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

Answer: 6 miles
