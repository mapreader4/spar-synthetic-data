Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Diane is twice as old as her brother, Will.
2) Will was 4 years old 3 years ago.
3) To find Will's current age, we add 3 years to his age 3 years ago: 4 + 3 = 7 years old.
4) Since Diane is twice as old as Will, Diane's current age is 2 * 7 = 14 years old.
5) In 5 years, Will will be 7 + 5 = 12 years old.
6) In 5 years, Diane will be 14 + 5 = 19 years old.
7) The sum of their ages in 5 years will be 12 + 19 = 31.
