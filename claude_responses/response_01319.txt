Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The party ordered:
  - 3 dozen oysters on the half shell at $15.00 per dozen
  - 2 pounds of steamed shrimp at $14.00 per pound
  - 2 pounds of fried clams at $13.50 per pound
* To calculate the total cost:
  - Oysters: 3 dozen x $15.00 = $45.00
  - Shrimp: 2 pounds x $14.00 = $28.00
  - Clams: 2 pounds x $13.50 = $27.00
* The total cost of the meal is:
  - $45.00 + $28.00 + $27.00 = $100.00
* The party is splitting the bill equally, so:
  - $100.00 / 4 people = $25.00 per person
