Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each chip is 10 calories
* A bag has 24 chips and costs $2
* Peter wants to eat 480 calories

First, we need to find out how many chips Peter needs to eat to get 480 calories:
* 480 calories / 10 calories per chip = 48 chips

Now, we need to find out how many bags of chips Peter needs to buy to get 48 chips:
* 48 chips / 24 chips per bag = 2 bags

Finally, we can calculate the cost of 2 bags of chips:
* 2 bags x $2 per bag = $4

Answer: $4
