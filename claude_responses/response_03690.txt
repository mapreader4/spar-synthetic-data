Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sandy's monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now.
   * Let's call Sandy's current age 'x'.
   * Then, her monthly phone bill expense is 10x.

2. In two years, Sandy will be three times as old as Kim.
   * Kim is currently 10 years old.
   * In two years, Kim will be 12 years old.
   * In two years, Sandy will be x + 2 years old.
   * So, x + 2 = 3 * 12 = 36
   * Solving for x, we get x = 34.

3. Therefore, Sandy's current age is 34 years old.
   * Her monthly phone bill expense is 10 * 34 = $340.

Answer: 340
