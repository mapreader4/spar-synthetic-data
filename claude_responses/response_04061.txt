Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* When it's raining, Ken can cycle 30 miles in 20 minutes
* When it's snowing, Ken can cycle 10 miles in 20 minutes
* It rains 3 times and snows 4 times in one week
* Ken cycles for 1 hour a day

First, let's calculate how many miles Ken can cycle in 1 hour when it's raining:
* 30 miles in 20 minutes
* 60 minutes / 20 minutes = 3 sets of 30 miles
* 3 x 30 miles = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate how many miles Ken can cycle in 1 hour when it's snowing:
* 10 miles in 20 minutes
* 60 minutes / 20 minutes = 3 sets of 10 miles
* 3 x 10 miles = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the total miles Ken can cycle in one week:
* 3 days of rain, 90 miles per day = 270 miles
* 4 days of snow, 30 miles per day = 120 miles
* Total miles = 270 + 120 = 390 miles

Answer: 390 miles
