Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Susan had a bouquet of 3 dozen roses. 3 dozen is equal to 36 roses.
2) She gave half of the bouquet to her daughter. Half of 36 is 18.
3) The remaining flowers were placed in a vase. The number of flowers in the vase is 36 - 18 = 18.
4) The next day, one-third of the flowers in the vase were wilted. One-third of 18 is 6.
5) After removing the wilted flowers, the number of flowers remaining in the vase is 18 - 6 = 12.
