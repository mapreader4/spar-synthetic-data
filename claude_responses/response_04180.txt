Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maria buys a large bar of French soap that lasts her for 2 months
* She spends $8.00 per bar of soap
* She wants to stock up for the entire year, which is 12 months

To calculate the total cost, we need to figure out how many bars of soap she needs to buy for the year.
* Since one bar lasts her 2 months, she will need 6 bars of soap for the year (12 months / 2 months per bar = 6 bars)

Now we can calculate the total cost:
* 6 bars of soap x $8.00 per bar = $48.00

Therefore, the total amount Maria will spend on soap is:

Answer: $48
