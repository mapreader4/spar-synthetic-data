Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The cost of the meal items:
- Smoky salmon: $40
- Black burger: $15
- Chicken katsu: $25
2) Total cost of the meal items: $40 + $15 + $25 = $80
3) The bill includes a 10% service charge, which is 10% of $80 = $8
4) The bill also includes a 5% tip, which is 5% of $80 = $4
5) The total bill amount is the sum of the meal items ($80) plus the service charge ($8) and the tip ($4), which is $80 + $8 + $4 = $92
6) Mr. Arevalo paid with $100, so the change he will receive is $100 - $92 = $8.
