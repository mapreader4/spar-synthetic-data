Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Lacson harvested 80 sweet potatoes
* She sold 20 of them to Mrs. Adams
* She sold 15 of them to Mr. Lenon
* To find the number of sweet potatoes not yet sold, we need to subtract the number of sweet potatoes sold from the total number of sweet potatoes harvested

First, let's calculate the total number of sweet potatoes sold:
* 20 sold to Mrs. Adams
* 15 sold to Mr. Lenon
* Total sold = 20 + 15 = 35

Now, let's subtract the total number sold from the total number harvested:
* 80 harvested - 35 sold = 45 not yet sold

Answer: 45
