Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Meadow orders 30 boxes of diapers per week.
2) Each box contains 40 packs of diapers.
3) Each pack contains 160 diapers.
4) So the total number of diapers Meadow orders per week is:
   30 boxes x 40 packs/box x 160 diapers/pack = 192,000 diapers per week.
5) Meadow sells each diaper for $5.
6) So the total revenue Meadow makes from selling all her diapers per week is:
   192,000 diapers x $5/diaper = $960,000 per week.

Answer: $960,000
