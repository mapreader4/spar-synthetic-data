Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 3414 yellow balloons.
2) There are 1762 more black balloons than yellow balloons.
3) To find the number of black balloons, we add 1762 to the number of yellow balloons:
   3414 + 1762 = 5176 black balloons.
4) The total number of balloons is the sum of the yellow and black balloons:
   3414 + 5176 = 8590 total balloons.
5) The balloons will be evenly divided among 10 schools.
6) To find the number of balloons each school will receive, we divide the total number of balloons by 10:
   8590 / 10 = 859 balloons per school.

Answer: 859
