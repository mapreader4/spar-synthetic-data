Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bart receives $0.2 for every question he answers in the survey.
2. Each survey has 10 questions.
3. On Monday, he finished 3 surveys.
   * 3 surveys x 10 questions per survey = 30 questions answered
   * 30 questions answered x $0.2 per question = $6 earned on Monday
4. On Tuesday, he finished 4 surveys.
   * 4 surveys x 10 questions per survey = 40 questions answered
   * 40 questions answered x $0.2 per question = $8 earned on Tuesday
5. To calculate the total amount of money he earned during the two days:
   * $6 (Monday) + $8 (Tuesday) = $14

Answer: 14
