Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* It takes 1 hour for the refrigerated dough to come to room temperature
* It takes 15 minutes to shape the dough
* It takes 2 hours to proof the dough
* It takes 30 minutes to bake the bread
* It takes 15 minutes to cool the bread

Now, let's calculate the total time required to prepare the bread:
* 1 hour (dough coming to room temperature)
* 15 minutes (shaping the dough)
* 2 hours (proofing the dough)
* 30 minutes (baking the bread)
* 15 minutes (cooling the bread)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 hours and 0 minutes.

The bakery opens at 6:00 am, so the latest time the head baker can make it to the store to start working is:
* 6:00 am + 4 hours = 10:00 am

Answer: 10:00 am
