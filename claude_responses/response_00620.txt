Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 13 rabbits in the cage initially
* 7 more rabbits are added to the cage
* So the total number of rabbits in the cage is 13 + 7 = 20
* The number of rabbits in the cage is 1/3 the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today
* Let's call the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today as "x"
* Then we can say: 20 = 1/3 * x
* Solving for x, we get: x = 20 * 3 = 60

Answer: 60
