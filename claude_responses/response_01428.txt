Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Adam owns 15 blocks of basswood, and each block of basswood can create 3 figurines
* So, the number of figurines he can make from the basswood is:
15 blocks x 3 figurines per block = 45 figurines
* Adam also owns 20 blocks of butternut wood, and each block of butternut wood can create 4 figurines
* So, the number of figurines he can make from the butternut wood is:
20 blocks x 4 figurines per block = 80 figurines
* Finally, Adam owns 20 blocks of Aspen wood, and each block of Aspen wood can make twice the amount of figurines compared to basswood
* Since each block of basswood can make 3 figurines, each block of Aspen wood can make 2 x 3 = 6 figurines
* So, the number of figurines he can make from the Aspen wood is:
20 blocks x 6 figurines per block = 120 figurines
* Now, to find the total number of figurines Adam can make, we add up the figurines from each type of wood:
45 + 80 + 120 = 245 figurines

Answer: 245
