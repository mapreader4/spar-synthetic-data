Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jett bought the cow for $600
2) He spent $20 per day on food for 40 days, so the total food cost is $20 x 40 = $800
3) He spent $500 to vaccinate and deworm the cow
4) He sold the cow for $2500 after 40 days

To calculate the profit, we need to subtract all the costs from the selling price:
Total cost = $600 (purchase price) + $800 (food) + $500 (vaccination/deworming) = $1900
Selling price = $2500
Profit = Selling price - Total cost
         = $2500 - $1900
         = $600

Answer: $600
