Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes the dog groomer 10 minutes to dry a short-haired dog like a beagle.
* It takes him twice as long to dry a full-haired, fluffy dog like a german shepherd, which is 20 minutes.
* He has 6 short-haired dogs to dry and 9 full-haired dogs to dry.

To calculate the total time it takes him to dry all the dogs:
* For the 6 short-haired dogs:
  - 6 dogs x 10 minutes per dog = 60 minutes
* For the 9 full-haired dogs:
  - 9 dogs x 20 minutes per dog = 180 minutes
* Total time = 60 minutes + 180 minutes = 240 minutes

Now, to convert the total time from minutes to hours:
* 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Answer: 4 hours
