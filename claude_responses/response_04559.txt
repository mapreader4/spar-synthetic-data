Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Marina had 4.5 pounds of fudge.
2) Lazlo had 6 ounces less than 4 pounds of fudge.
3) To convert 4 pounds to ounces, we multiply by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound): 4 pounds x 16 ounces/pound = 64 ounces.
4) Lazlo had 6 ounces less than 64 ounces, so Lazlo had 64 - 6 = 58 ounces of fudge.
5) To find the difference between Marina's and Lazlo's fudge, we need to convert Marina's 4.5 pounds to ounces. 4.5 pounds x 16 ounces/pound = 72 ounces.
6) The difference between Marina's 72 ounces and Lazlo's 58 ounces is 72 - 58 = 14 ounces.

Answer: 14 ounces
