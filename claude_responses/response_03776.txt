Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Julia has a parrot and a rabbit
* She buys food for both animals for $30 in total per week
* She has the rabbit for 5 weeks
* She has the parrot for 3 weeks
* The weekly cost of the rabbit food is $12

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rabbit food:
* Rabbit food cost per week: $12
* Rabbit food cost for 5 weeks: $12 x 5 = $60

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the parrot food:
* Total food cost per week: $30
* Rabbit food cost per week: $12
* Parrot food cost per week: $30 - $12 = $18
* Parrot food cost for 3 weeks: $18 x 3 = $54

Finally, we can add the total cost of the rabbit food and the parrot food to get the total amount Julia has already spent on food for her animals:
* Total cost = Rabbit food cost + Parrot food cost
* Total cost = $60 + $54 = $114

Answer: $114
