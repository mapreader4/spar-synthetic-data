Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 16 cats in the house
* 2 of them are white
* 25% of the 16 cats are black
* To calculate 25% of 16:
  * 25% = 0.25
  * 0.25 * 16 = 4
* So, 4 of the cats are black
* The remaining cats must be grey
* To calculate the number of grey cats:
  * Total cats = 16
  * White cats = 2
  * Black cats = 4
  * Grey cats = Total cats - White cats - Black cats
  * Grey cats = 16 - 2 - 4 = 10
