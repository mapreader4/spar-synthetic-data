Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
2) The largest angle is 5 times bigger than the smallest angle.
3) The middle angle is 3 times bigger than the smallest angle.
4) Let's call the smallest angle x.
5) Then the largest angle is 5x, and the middle angle is 3x.
6) The sum of the three angles must be 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
x + 3x + 5x = 180
7) Simplifying, we get:
9x = 180
8) Solving for x, we get:
x = 20
Answer: 20 degrees.
