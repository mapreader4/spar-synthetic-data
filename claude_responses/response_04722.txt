Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jane sews 2 dresses a day for 7 days. So, in the first 7 days, she sews 2 dresses per day for a total of 2 x 7 = 14 dresses.
2) Then, she sews 3 dresses a day for the next 2 days. So, in the next 2 days, she sews 3 dresses per day for a total of 3 x 2 = 6 dresses.
3) In total, Jane sews 14 + 6 = 20 dresses.
4) Jane adds 2 ribbons to each dress. So, the total number of ribbons used is 20 dresses x 2 ribbons per dress = 40 ribbons.

Answer: 40
