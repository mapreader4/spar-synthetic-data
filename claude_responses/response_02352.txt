Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The distance James needs to drive is 360 miles.
2) He is driving at a speed of 60 mph.
3) He has a 1 hour stop along the way.
4) To calculate the total time it takes him to get to Canada, we need to divide the distance by the speed, and then add the 1 hour stop.
5) The time it takes him to drive the 360 miles at 60 mph is 360 miles / 60 mph = 6 hours.
6) Adding the 1 hour stop, the total time it takes James to get to Canada is 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours.

Answer: 7 hours
