Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Thomas has been saving $40 per month for 6 years
* 6 years = 72 months
* So, the total amount Thomas has saved is:
    * $40 per month x 72 months = $2,880
* Joseph has been saving 2/5 times less money per month than Thomas
* 2/5 of $40 is $16
* So, Joseph has been saving $40 - $16 = $24 per month
* Joseph has also been saving for 72 months
* So, the total amount Joseph has saved is:
    * $24 per month x 72 months = $1,728
* The total amount they have saved together is:
    * $2,880 + $1,728 = $4,608

Answer: 4,608
