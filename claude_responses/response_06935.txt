Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The air conditioner consumes 7.2 kilowatts when running for 8 hours.
* We want to find the consumption for 6 hours a day for 5 days.
* To find the consumption for 6 hours, we can use a proportion:
* 8 hours : 7.2 kilowatts = 6 hours : x kilowatts
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = (6 * 7.2) / 8 = 5.4 kilowatts per day
* Now, we need to find the total consumption for 5 days:
* 5.4 kilowatts per day * 5 days = 27 kilowatts

Answer: 27 kilowatts
