Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emmalyn is paid 20 cents per meter of fence painted.
2) There are 50 fences in the neighborhood that she has to paint.
3) Each fence is 500 meters long.
4) To calculate the total amount she earned, we need to:
   a) Calculate the total meters of fence she painted
   b) Multiply the total meters by the rate of 20 cents per meter
To calculate the total meters of fence:
* 50 fences x 500 meters per fence = 25,000 total meters
To calculate the total amount earned:
* 25,000 total meters x 20 cents per meter = $5,000
Answer: $5,000
