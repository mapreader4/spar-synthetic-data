Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Sabrina started with 20 cookies.
2) She gave 10 cookies to her brother.
3) Her mother gave her half the number of cookies she gave her brother, which is 5 cookies.
4) So now Sabrina has 20 - 10 + 5 = 15 cookies.
5) Sabrina then gave two-thirds of her cookies to her sister.
6) Two-thirds of 15 is 10 cookies.
7) So Sabrina is left with 15 - 10 = 5 cookies.
