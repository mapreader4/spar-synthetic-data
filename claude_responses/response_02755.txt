Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A pencil sells for $0.25 at A.T. Cross Luxury Pens
* A pen sells for $0.15 at A.T. Cross Luxury Pens
* Bowen buys 40 pens
* Bowen buys 2/5 times more pencils than pens

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens:
* 40 pens x $0.15 per pen = $6.00

Next, let's calculate the number of pencils Bowen buys:
* 2/5 times more pencils than pens = 2/5 x 40 = 16 pencils

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
* 16 pencils x $0.25 per pencil = $4.00

Finally, to get the total amount of money Bowen spends, we add the cost of the pens and the cost of the pencils:
* $6.00 + $4.00 = $10.00

Answer: $10
