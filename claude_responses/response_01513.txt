Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom's cat is 8 years old
* His rabbit is half the age of his cat
* To find the age of the rabbit, we take half of the cat's age:
  * Rabbit's age = 8 / 2 = 4 years old
* His dog is three times as old as his rabbit
* To find the age of the dog, we multiply the rabbit's age by 3:
  * Dog's age = 4 * 3 = 12 years old

Answer: 12
