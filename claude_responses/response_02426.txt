Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wendy received a scholarship worth $20,000.
2) Kelly received a scholarship worth twice the amount Wendy received, which means Kelly's scholarship was worth $40,000.
3) Nina's scholarship was worth $8,000 less than Kelly's scholarship, so Nina's scholarship was worth $32,000.
4) To find the total amount of scholarship money received, we add up the amounts for Wendy, Kelly, and Nina:
$20,000 + $40,000 + $32,000 = $92,000.

Answer: $92,000
