Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason pepper-sprays some raccoons
* He also pepper-sprays 6 times as many squirrels as raccoons
* The total number of animals he pepper-sprays is 84

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of raccoons he pepper-sprays
* Then the number of squirrels he pepper-sprays is 6x

We know the total number of animals is 84, so we can write the equation:
x + 6x = 84

Solving for x:
7x = 84
x = 84/7
x = 12

Therefore, the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays is 12.

Answer: 12
