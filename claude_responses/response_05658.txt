Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have 4 friends: Dilan, Martha, Phillip, and Veronica.
2) The total number of marbles they have is 14 + 20 + 19 + 7 = 60 marbles.
3) To redistribute the marbles so they each have an equal number, we need to divide the total number of marbles by 4 (the number of friends).
4) 60 marbles / 4 friends = 15 marbles per friend.

Answer: 15
