Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John is currently 39 years old.
2) 3 years ago, John was 36 years old.
3) 3 years ago, John was twice as old as James will be in 6 years.
4) So, 3 years ago, John was 36 years old, and James will be 36/2 = 18 years old in 6 years.
5) Therefore, James is currently 18 - 6 = 12 years old.
6) James' older brother is 4 years older than James, so he is 12 + 4 = 16 years old.

Answer: 16
