Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason drives past 3 convenience stores on his way to work
* The distance between the first store and the second store is 6 miles
* The distance between the second store and the third store is 2/3rds longer than the distance between the first two stores
* The distance from his house to the first store and the last store to work is the same, 4 miles

To calculate the total distance of Jason's commute, we need to find the distance between the second and third stores, and then add up all the distances.

The distance between the second and third stores is 2/3rds longer than the distance between the first two stores, which is 6 miles. So the distance between the second and third stores is:
* 6 miles + (2/3 * 6 miles) = 6 miles + 4 miles = 10 miles

Now we can add up all the distances:
* Distance from house to first store: 4 miles
* Distance from first store to second store: 6 miles
* Distance from second store to third store: 10 miles
* Distance from third store to work: 4 miles

Total distance = 4 miles + 6 miles + 10 miles + 4 miles = 24 miles

Answer: 24 miles
