Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Martha buys 1 latte for $4.00 every morning, 5 days a week.
   * This means she spends $4.00 x 5 days = $20.00 per week on lattes.
   * In a year (52 weeks), she would spend $20.00 x 52 = $1,040.00 on lattes.

2. 3 days a week, she buys an iced coffee for $2.00.
   * This means she spends $2.00 x 3 days = $6.00 per week on iced coffees.
   * In a year (52 weeks), she would spend $6.00 x 52 = $312.00 on iced coffees.

3. Her total coffee spending in a year would be:
   * Lattes: $1,040.00
   * Iced Coffees: $312.00
   * Total: $1,040.00 + $312.00 = $1,352.00

4. Her goal is to cut her coffee spending by 25%.
   * 25% of $1,352.00 is $338.00.
   * Therefore, she wants to save $338.00 on her coffee spending.

Answer: $338.00
