Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Freyja is 10 years old
* Eli is 9 years older than Freyja
* Eli's age = 10 + 9 = 19 years old
* Sarah is twice as old as Eli
* Sarah's age = 19 x 2 = 38 years old
* Kaylin is 5 years younger than Sarah
* Kaylin's age = 38 - 5 = 33 years old

Answer: 33
