Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nina buys 3 toys at $10 each. So the total cost of the toys is 3 * $10 = $30.
2) Nina buys 2 packs of basketball cards at $5 each. So the total cost of the basketball cards is 2 * $5 = $10.
3) Nina buys 5 shirts at $6 each. So the total cost of the shirts is 5 * $6 = $30.
4) To calculate the total amount Nina spends, we add up the costs of the toys, basketball cards, and shirts:
$30 + $10 + $30 = $70.

Answer: 70
