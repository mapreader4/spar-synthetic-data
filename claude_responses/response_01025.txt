Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The survey was conducted with 800 parents
* 20% of the 800 parents agree to a tuition fee increase
* To find the number of parents who disagree, we need to find the number of parents who do not agree to the tuition fee increase

First, let's find the number of parents who agree to the tuition fee increase:
* 20% of 800 = 0.20 * 800 = 160 parents agree

Now, to find the number of parents who disagree, we subtract the number of parents who agree from the total number of parents:
* 800 - 160 = 640 parents disagree

Answer: 640
