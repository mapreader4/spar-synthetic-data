Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ashley invited 20 of her friends to the party.
2) Each of the 20 invited guests was told to invite one more person to attend the party.
3) So the total number of invited guests is 20 + 20 = 40 people.
4) Half of the 40 invited guests (which is 20 people) each came with one more person.
5) So the additional 20 people who came with the invited guests brings the total number of people at the party to 40 + 20 = 60 people.
6) Finally, we need to include Ashley, so the total number of people at the party is 60 + 1 = 61 people.

Answer: 61
