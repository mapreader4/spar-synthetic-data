Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 3 reels of 100m fishing line
* Each reel is 100m long
* He cuts the fishing line into 10m sections
* To find the total number of sections, we need to:
1. Calculate the total length of the fishing line
2. Divide the total length by the length of each section

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the fishing line
* Total length = 3 reels x 100m per reel = 300m

Step 2: Divide the total length by the length of each section
* Number of sections = 300m / 10m per section = 30 sections

Answer: 30
