Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hortense planted 25 daisy seeds and 25 sunflower seeds.
2) 60% of the daisy seeds germinate. To calculate this, we take 60% of 25 daisy seeds:
   * 60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 daisy plants germinate
3) 80% of the sunflower seeds germinate. To calculate this, we take 80% of 25 sunflower seeds:
   * 80% of 25 = 0.8 * 25 = 20 sunflower plants germinate
4) 80% of the resulting plants produce flowers. This means that 80% of the 15 daisy plants and 80% of the 20 sunflower plants will produce flowers.
   * 80% of 15 daisy plants = 0.8 * 15 = 12 daisy plants produce flowers
   * 80% of 20 sunflower plants = 0.8 * 20 = 16 sunflower plants produce flowers
5) In total, Hortense will grow 12 daisy plants and 16 sunflower plants that produce flowers.
