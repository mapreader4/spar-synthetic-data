Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marcy spends 12 minutes petting her cat
* She spends 1/3 of that time combing the cat
* To find the time spent combing the cat, we take 1/3 of 12 minutes:
    * 1/3 of 12 minutes = 12 * 1/3 = 4 minutes
* So, the total time Marcy spends with her cat is the time spent petting (12 minutes) plus the time spent combing (4 minutes)
* 12 minutes + 4 minutes = 16 minutes

Answer: 16 minutes
