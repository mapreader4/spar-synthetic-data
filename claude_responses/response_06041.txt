Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Natalia has 145 novels, 271 comics, 419 documentaries, and 209 albums to store.
2) She wants to put these items in crates that can hold 9 items each.
3) To find the total number of items, we add up the individual counts:
145 novels + 271 comics + 419 documentaries + 209 albums = 1044 items
4) To find the number of crates needed, we divide the total number of items by the capacity of each crate:
1044 items / 9 items per crate = 116 crates
5) Since we can't have a fractional crate, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 116 crates
