Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cid charges $20 for an oil change
* He changed the oil of 5 cars
* So for the oil changes, he earned: 5 cars x $20 per oil change = $100

* Cid charges $30 for a repair
* He repaired 10 cars
* So for the repairs, he earned: 10 cars x $30 per repair = $300

* Cid charges $5 for a car wash
* He washed 15 cars
* So for the car washes, he earned: 15 cars x $5 per wash = $75

* To calculate the total amount of money Cid earned, we add up the earnings from the oil changes, repairs, and car washes:
* $100 + $300 + $75 = $475

Answer: $475
