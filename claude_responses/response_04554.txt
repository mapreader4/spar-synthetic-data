Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Michael needs to make:
   - 5 peach pies
   - 4 apple pies
   - 3 blueberry pies

2. Each pie recipe calls for 3 pounds of fruit.

3. For the peach pies:
   - 5 pies x 3 pounds per pie = 15 pounds of peaches
   - Peaches cost $2.00 per pound
   - 15 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $30.00 for peaches

4. For the apple pies:
   - 4 pies x 3 pounds per pie = 12 pounds of apples
   - Apples cost $1.00 per pound
   - 12 pounds x $1.00 per pound = $12.00 for apples

5. For the blueberry pies:
   - 3 pies x 3 pounds per pie = 9 pounds of blueberries
   - Blueberries cost $1.00 per pound
   - 9 pounds x $1.00 per pound = $9.00 for blueberries

6. Adding up the costs:
   - $30.00 (peaches) + $12.00 (apples) + $9.00 (blueberries) = $51.00 total

Answer: $51
