Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Arnel had 10 boxes of pencils with the same number of pencils in each box.
2) He kept 10 pencils for himself.
3) The remaining pencils were shared equally among his 5 friends.
4) Each of his 5 friends received 8 pencils.
5) To find the total number of pencils that were shared among the friends, we can multiply 8 (the number of pencils each friend received) by 5 (the number of friends).
6) 8 x 5 = 40 pencils were shared among the friends.
7) Since Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself, the total number of pencils that were shared is 40 + 10 = 50 pencils.
8) Since the 50 pencils were equally distributed among the 10 boxes, each box must have contained 50 / 10 = 5 pencils.
