Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sammy scored 20 points.
2) Gab scored twice as many as Sammy's score, which means Gab scored 2 x 20 = 40 points.
3) Cher scored twice as many as Gab's score, which means Cher scored 2 x 40 = 80 points.
4) The total points scored by Sammy, Gab, and Cher is 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 points.
5) The opponent scored 85 points.
6) To find how many more points Sammy, Gab, and Cher have than their opponent, we subtract the opponent's score from their total score:
140 - 85 = 55 points.

Answer: 55
