Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alex buys 3 individual bags of potato chips for $1.00 each, so the total cost of the potato chips is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00
* He also buys $5.00 worth of creme fraiche to dollop on each chip
* Finally, he buys $73.00 worth of caviar
* The total cost of the ingredients is $3.00 + $5.00 + $73.00 = $81.00
* The appetizer will serve 3 people
* To calculate the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the number of people served: $81.00 / 3 = $27.00

Answer: $27
