Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The aquarium has fish in 3 different colors: orange, green, and blue.
2) Blue fish make up half of all the fish in the aquarium.
3) There are 15 fewer orange fish than blue fish.
4) The total number of fish in the aquarium is 80.

Let's start by finding the number of blue fish:
* Blue fish make up half of all the fish, so the number of blue fish is 80 / 2 = 40.

Now, let's find the number of orange fish:
* There are 15 fewer orange fish than blue fish, so the number of orange fish is 40 - 15 = 25.

Finally, we can find the number of green fish:
* The total number of fish is 80, and we know the number of blue fish (40) and the number of orange fish (25).
* So the number of green fish must be 80 - 40 - 25 = 15.

Answer: 15
