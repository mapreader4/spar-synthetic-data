Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Night 1: Coral reads 30 pages.

Night 2: Coral reads 2 less than twice the number of pages read on Night 1.
* Pages read on Night 1: 30
* Twice the number of pages read on Night 1: 2 x 30 = 60
* 2 less than 60: 60 - 2 = 58
* So, Coral reads 58 pages on Night 2.

Night 3: Coral reads 3 more pages than the sum of the first two nights.
* Pages read on Night 1: 30
* Pages read on Night 2: 58
* Sum of pages read on Night 1 and Night 2: 30 + 58 = 88
* 3 more pages than 88: 88 + 3 = 91
* So, Coral reads 91 pages on Night 3.

Now, to find the total number of pages Coral read in the 3 nights:
* Pages read on Night 1: 30
* Pages read on Night 2: 58
* Pages read on Night 3: 91
* Total pages read: 30 + 58 + 91 = 179

Answer: 179
