Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Parker found 4 twenty-pound dumbbells set up for weightlifting.
* He added two more dumbbells to the setup.
* Each dumbbell weighs 20 pounds.

To calculate the total weight of the dumbbells Parker is using, we need to:
1. Calculate the weight of the initial 4 dumbbells:
   * 4 dumbbells x 20 pounds per dumbbell = 80 pounds
2. Add the weight of the 2 additional dumbbells:
   * 2 dumbbells x 20 pounds per dumbbell = 40 pounds
3. Add the weight of the initial 4 dumbbells and the 2 additional dumbbells:
   * 80 pounds + 40 pounds = 120 pounds

Answer: 120 pounds
