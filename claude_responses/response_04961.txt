Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

2) Of the 100 students who wore colored lipstick, one quarter wore red lipstick. So, the number of students who wore red lipstick is 100 / 4 = 25 students.
3) There were one-fifth as many students wearing blue lipstick as were wearing red lipstick. So, the number of students wearing blue lipstick is 25 / 5 = 5 students.
