Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Thompson bought 3 chickens
* Each chicken cost $3
* So the total cost of the 3 chickens is:
  * 3 chickens x $3 per chicken = $9
* Mrs. Thompson paid a total of $15
* So the remaining amount, which is the cost of the potatoes, is:
  * $15 total - $9 for the chickens = $6
* Therefore, the cost of the potatoes is:
Answer: $6
