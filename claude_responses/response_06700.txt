Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Billy has $10 to spend on ketchup
* The first option is a 10 oz bottle for $1 each
* With $10, he could buy 10 of these bottles
* The second option is a 16 oz bottle for $2
* With $10, he could buy 5 of these bottles
* The third option is a 25 oz bottle for $2.5
* With $10, he could buy 4 of these bottles
* The fourth option is a 50 oz bottle for $5
* With $10, he could buy 2 of these bottles
* The fifth option is a 200 oz bottle for $10
* With $10, he could buy 1 of these bottles
* To get the best deal, Billy should buy the largest bottle, which is the 200 oz bottle for $10.
* Therefore, the number of bottles Billy buys is 1.
