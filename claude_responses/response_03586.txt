Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ernest bought 50 meters of wire.
2) He cut the wire into 5 equal parts.
3) This means each part is 50 meters / 5 = 10 meters.
4) He used 3 parts of the wire.
5) So the total length of wire used is 3 parts x 10 meters per part = 30 meters.
6) The length of wire not used is the total length (50 meters) minus the length used (30 meters).

Answer: 20 meters
