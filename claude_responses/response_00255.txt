Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bush is 12 years old this year
* Matt is 3 years older than Bush
* So, if Bush is 12 this year, then Matt must be 15 this year (12 + 3)
* The question asks for Matt's age 10 years from now
* 10 years from now, Bush will be 12 + 10 = 22 years old
* And Matt will be 15 + 10 = 25 years old

Answer: 25
