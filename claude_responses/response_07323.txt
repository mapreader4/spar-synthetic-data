Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The flight leaves at 8:00 pm
* It's recommended to check in 2 hours early, so that would be 6:00 pm
* It takes 45 minutes to drive to the airport
* It takes another 15 minutes to park and make their way to the terminal
* So the total time needed before the check-in time is:
    - 45 minutes to drive to the airport
    - 15 minutes to park and get to the terminal
    - Total time: 45 + 15 = 60 minutes (1 hour)
* Therefore, the latest time they can leave their house is 6:00 pm - 1 hour = 5:00 pm

Answer: 5:00 pm
