Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. It takes 10 minutes for the Uber to get to Mary's house.
2. It takes 5 times longer for the Uber to get to the airport, which is 5 x 10 = 50 minutes.
3. It takes 15 minutes to check her bag.
4. It takes 3 times as long to get through security, which is 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.
5. She has to wait 20 minutes for her flight to start boarding.
6. She has to wait twice as long before the plane is ready to take off, which is 2 x 20 = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time:
10 minutes + 50 minutes + 15 minutes + 45 minutes + 20 minutes + 40 minutes = 180 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours

Answer: 3 hours
