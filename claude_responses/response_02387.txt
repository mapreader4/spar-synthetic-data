Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dirk sells amulets for 2 days
2) Each day he sells 25 amulets
3) Each amulet sells for $40
4) Each amulet costs him $30 to make
5) He has to give 10% of his revenue to the faire

First, let's calculate his total revenue:
* Total amulets sold = 25 amulets per day x 2 days = 50 amulets
* Revenue per amulet = $40
* Total revenue = 50 amulets x $40 per amulet = $2,000

Next, let's calculate his total cost:
* Cost per amulet = $30
* Total cost = 50 amulets x $30 per amulet = $1,500

Now, let's calculate the amount he has to give to the faire:
* 10% of total revenue = 0.10 x $2,000 = $200

Finally, let's calculate his profit:
* Profit = Total revenue - Total cost - Amount given to the faire
* Profit = $2,000 - $1,500 - $200 = $300

Answer: $300
