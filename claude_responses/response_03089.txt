Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first week, Tracy collected a certain number of books
* In the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week
* In total, she has 99 books

Let's call the number of books she collected in the first week "x".

In the first week, she collected x books.
In the next five weeks, she collected 10x books.

The total number of books she collected is the sum of the books collected in the first week and the next five weeks:
x + 10x = 99

Simplifying the equation:
11x = 99

Solving for x:
x = 99 / 11
x = 9

Therefore, in the first week, Tracy collected 9 books.

Answer: 9
