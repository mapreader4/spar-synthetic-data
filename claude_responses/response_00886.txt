Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jack went to the supermarket with $100.
2) He bought 4 bottles of water, and each bottle cost $2. So the total cost of the 4 bottles of water is:
4 bottles x $2 per bottle = $8
3) His mother then asked him to buy twice as many bottles as he already bought, which is 8 more bottles. The total cost of the 8 additional bottles is:
8 bottles x $2 per bottle = $16
4) So the total cost of the water bottles is $8 + $16 = $24.
5) He also bought half a pound of cheese, and 1 pound of cheese costs $10. So half a pound of cheese costs $5.
6) The total cost of the water bottles and the cheese is $24 + $5 = $29.
7) Jack originally had $100, and he spent $29, so the amount of money he has remaining is:
$100 - $29 = $71.
