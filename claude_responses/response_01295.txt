Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lilia has 15 peaches in total.
2) She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each.
   * 10 peaches x $2 per peach = $20 earned from selling to friends.
3) She sold 4 peaches to her relatives for $1.25 each.
   * 4 peaches x $1.25 per peach = $5 earned from selling to relatives.
4) She kept the remaining 1 peach for herself.
5) To calculate the total amount Lilia earned, we add the amounts from selling to friends and relatives:
   * $20 + $5 = $25 total earned.

Answer: $25
