Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom invites his parents and 3 siblings, so that's a total of 6 people (Tom, his parents, and 3 siblings)
* Each person eats 3 times a day
* Each person uses 2 plates per meal
* They are there for 4 days

To calculate the total number of plates used:
* Number of people: 6
* Meals per day: 3
* Plates per meal: 2
* Days: 4
* Total plates used = 6 people x 3 meals per day x 2 plates per meal x 4 days
* = 6 x 3 x 2 x 4
* = 144

Answer: 144
