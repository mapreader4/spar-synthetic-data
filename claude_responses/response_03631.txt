Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Codger is a three-footed sloth, so he needs 3 shoes per set
* He already owns 1 set of 3 shoes
* He wants to have a total of 5 complete sets of 3 shoes each
* To calculate the number of additional sets he needs to buy, we can do the following:
* Total sets desired: 5
* Sets he already owns: 1
* Additional sets he needs to buy: 5 - 1 = 4
* Each set requires 3 shoes
* So, the total number of additional shoes he needs to buy is: 4 sets x 3 shoes per set = 12 shoes
* Since the stores only sell shoes in pairs, he needs to buy 6 pairs of shoes.
