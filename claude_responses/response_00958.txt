Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Djibo is currently 17 years old.
2) Five years ago, Djibo's age plus his sister's age was 35.
3) Five years ago, Djibo's age was 17 - 5 = 12 years old.
4) So, five years ago, the sum of Djibo's age (12) and his sister's age was 35.
5) Therefore, his sister's age five years ago was 35 - 12 = 23 years old.
6) Since five years have passed, his sister's age today is 23 + 5 = 28 years old.

Answer: 28
