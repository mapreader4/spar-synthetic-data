Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mark bought 2 pounds of tomatoes at $5 per pound.
   * The cost of the tomatoes is 2 pounds x $5 per pound = $10.

2. Mark bought 5 pounds of apples at $6 per pound.
   * The cost of the apples is 5 pounds x $6 per pound = $30.

3. To calculate the total amount Mark spent, we add the cost of the tomatoes and the cost of the apples:
   * Total cost = $10 (tomatoes) + $30 (apples) = $40.

Answer: 40
