Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dino works 20 hours a month making $10 an hour, so his earnings from this work are:
20 hours x $10 per hour = $200
* Dino works 30 hours a month making $20 an hour, so his earnings from this work are:
30 hours x $20 per hour = $600
* Dino works 5 hours a month making $40 an hour, so his earnings from this work are:
5 hours x $40 per hour = $200
* Adding up his total earnings:
$200 + $600 + $200 = $1,000
* Dino pays $500 a month in expenses.
* To calculate how much money Dino has left at the end of the month, we take his total earnings and subtract his expenses:
$1,000 - $500 = $500

Answer: $500
