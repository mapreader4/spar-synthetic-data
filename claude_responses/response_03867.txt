Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Susan works 5 days a week
* She has 6 days of paid vacation
* The remaining days of her 2-week vacation will be unpaid
* She gets paid $15 per hour and works 8 hours a day

First, let's calculate the number of unpaid vacation days:
* 2 weeks = 14 days
* Paid vacation days = 6
* Unpaid vacation days = 14 - 6 = 8 days

Now, let's calculate her daily pay:
* $15 per hour
* 8 hours per day
* Daily pay = $15 x 8 = $120

Finally, let's calculate the total pay she will miss on her vacation:
* Unpaid vacation days = 8
* Total pay missed = $120 x 8 = $960

Answer: $960
