Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 rounds in a typical tennis tournament
* In the first round, there are 8 games
* In the second round, there are 4 games
* In the third round, there are 2 games
* In the finals, there is 1 game
* Each game requires new tennis balls
* On average, each game uses 5 cans of tennis balls
* Each can has 3 tennis balls

To calculate the total number of tennis balls used:
* First round: 8 games x 5 cans/game x 3 balls/can = 120 tennis balls
* Second round: 4 games x 5 cans/game x 3 balls/can = 60 tennis balls
* Third round: 2 games x 5 cans/game x 3 balls/can = 30 tennis balls
* Finals: 1 game x 5 cans/game x 3 balls/can = 15 tennis balls

Adding these up:
120 + 60 + 30 + 15 = 225 tennis balls

Answer: 225
