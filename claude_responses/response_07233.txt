Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martha has 19 butterflies in her collection.
2) She has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies.
3) We know that Martha has 6 blue butterflies.
4) Since she has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies, we can deduce that she has 3 yellow butterflies (6 blue butterflies / 2 = 3 yellow butterflies).
5) Now we can calculate the number of black butterflies by subtracting the number of blue and yellow butterflies from the total number of butterflies:
19 total butterflies - 6 blue butterflies - 3 yellow butterflies = 10 black butterflies.
