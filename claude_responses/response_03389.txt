Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The initial price of RAM was $50.
2) Due to the fire, the price of RAM increased by 30%.
3) To calculate the new price after the 30% increase, we take the initial price of $50 and multiply it by 1.30 (since a 30% increase is the same as multiplying by 1.30).
4) $50 x 1.30 = $65, so the new price of RAM after the 30% increase is $65.
5) After two years, the price of RAM finally fell by 20% from the $65 price.
6) To calculate the new price after the 20% decrease, we take the $65 price and multiply it by 0.80 (since a 20% decrease is the same as multiplying by 0.80).
7) $65 x 0.80 = $52, so the current price of RAM is $52.
