Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Willow's daughter and her 3 friends each want 1.5 servings of pancakes
* 1.5 servings of 4 pancakes each = 6 pancakes per person
* So for the 4 girls, that's 4 x 6 = 24 pancakes
* Willow's son wants 3 servings of pancakes
* 3 servings of 4 pancakes each = 12 pancakes
* In total, Willow needs to make 24 + 12 = 36 pancakes
