Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The book has 93 pages total
* On Saturday, Jerry read 30 pages
* On Sunday, Jerry read 20 pages
* To calculate the remaining pages, we need to subtract the pages read from the total pages in the book

First, let's calculate the total pages read:
* Pages read on Saturday: 30
* Pages read on Sunday: 20
* Total pages read = 30 + 20 = 50 pages

Now, we can subtract the total pages read from the total pages in the book to get the remaining pages:
* Total pages in the book: 93
* Total pages read: 50
* Remaining pages = 93 - 50 = 43 pages

Answer: 43
