Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Javier exercised for 50 minutes every day for one week.
   * There are 7 days in a week.
   * So, Javier exercised for 50 minutes x 7 days = 350 minutes in total.

2) Sanda exercised for 90 minutes on each of three days.
   * Sanda exercised for 90 minutes x 3 days = 270 minutes in total.

3) To find the total minutes that Javier and Sanda exercised, we add their individual totals:
   * 350 minutes (Javier) + 270 minutes (Sanda) = 620 minutes.

Answer: 620
