Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Boris has 100 pieces of Halloween candy.
2) His daughter eats 8 pieces of candy, leaving 100 - 8 = 92 pieces of candy.
3) Boris separates the remaining 92 pieces of candy into 4 equal portions.
4) Each portion will have 92 / 4 = 23 pieces of candy.
5) Boris then takes away 3 pieces of candy from each bowl, leaving 23 - 3 = 20 pieces of candy in each bowl.

Answer: 20
