Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Classroom A needs to raise $200 for the community outreach program
* They have raised money from the following:
    - 2 families each gave $20, so that's 2 * $20 = $40
    - 8 families each gave $10, so that's 8 * $10 = $80
    - 10 families each gave $5, so that's 10 * $5 = $50
* Adding up the total amount raised:
    - $40 + $80 + $50 = $170
* To calculate how much more money Classroom A needs to reach the $200 goal:
    - $200 - $170 = $30

Answer: $30
