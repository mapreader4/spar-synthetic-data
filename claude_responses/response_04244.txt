Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ray took 10 chickens
2) Ray took 6 chickens less than Mary, so Mary must have taken 16 chickens (10 + 6)
3) John took 5 more chickens than Mary, so John must have taken 21 chickens (16 + 5)
4) To find how many more chickens John took than Ray, we subtract Ray's chickens from John's chickens:
21 chickens (John) - 10 chickens (Ray) = 11 chickens

Answer: 11
