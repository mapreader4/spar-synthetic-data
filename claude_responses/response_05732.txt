Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total number of students in Kylie's class is 50.
2) 10 students scored 90 marks each.
3) 15 students scored 10 marks fewer than the first 10 students, which means they scored 80 marks each.
4) The remaining 25 students scored 60 marks each.
5) To calculate the average marks for the whole class, we need to find the total marks scored by all the students and divide it by the total number of students.
6) Total marks scored by the 10 students who scored 90 marks each = 10 * 90 = 900
7) Total marks scored by the 15 students who scored 80 marks each = 15 * 80 = 1200
8) Total marks scored by the 25 students who scored 60 marks each = 25 * 60 = 1500
9) Total marks scored by the whole class = 900 + 1200 + 1500 = 3600
10) Average marks for the whole class = 3600 / 50 = 72

Answer: 72
