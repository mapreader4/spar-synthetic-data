Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Amalia can read 4 pages in 2 minutes
* This means she can read 2 pages per minute (4 pages / 2 minutes = 2 pages/minute)
* We want to know how long it will take her to read 18 pages
* To find this, we can divide the total number of pages (18) by the number of pages she can read per minute (2)
* 18 pages / 2 pages per minute = 9 minutes

Answer: 9 minutes
