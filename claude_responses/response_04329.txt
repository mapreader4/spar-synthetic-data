Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Leif's apple tree has 14 apples.
2) Leif's orange tree has 2 dozen oranges.
3) 1 dozen = 12 oranges.
4) 2 dozen = 2 x 12 = 24 oranges.
5) The number of oranges (24) minus the number of apples (14) is the difference.
6) 24 oranges - 14 apples = 10 more oranges than apples.
