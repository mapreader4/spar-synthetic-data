Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elise took a cab to the hospital
* The cab company charged a base price of $3
* They also charged $4 for every mile she traveled
* Elise paid a total of $23

To find the distance from her house to the hospital, we need to set up an equation:
* Total cost = Base price + (Price per mile × Distance)
* $23 = $3 + ($4 × Distance)
* $20 = $4 × Distance
* Distance = $20 / $4
* Distance = 5 miles

Answer: 5 miles
