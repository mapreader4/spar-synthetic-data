Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Normally, Carter bakes:
  - 6 cheesecakes
  - 5 muffins
  - 8 red velvet cakes
* This week, Carter was able to bake triple the number of each item:
  - Cheesecakes: 6 x 3 = 18
  - Muffins: 5 x 3 = 15
  - Red velvet cakes: 8 x 3 = 24
* In addition, he baked triple the number of chocolate moist cakes, which is not specified in the normal weekly baking.
  - Chocolate moist cakes: 3 x 3 = 9
* To calculate the total number of additional cakes baked this week:
  - Cheesecakes: 18 - 6 = 12 additional
  - Muffins: 15 - 5 = 10 additional
  - Red velvet cakes: 24 - 8 = 16 additional
  - Chocolate moist cakes: 9 additional
* Summing the additional cakes:
  - 12 + 10 + 16 + 9 = 47 additional cakes
