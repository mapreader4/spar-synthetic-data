Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The washing machine uses:
  - 20 gallons for a heavy wash
  - 10 gallons for a regular wash
  - 2 gallons for a light wash
* There are:
  - 2 heavy washes
  - 3 regular washes
  - 1 light wash
* 2 of the loads need to be bleached, which means an extra light wash cycle is added for rinsing.
* To calculate the total gallons of water needed:
  - 2 heavy washes x 20 gallons = 40 gallons
  - 3 regular washes x 10 gallons = 30 gallons
  - 1 light wash x 2 gallons = 2 gallons
  - 2 extra light washes for bleached loads x 2 gallons = 4 gallons
* Adding these up:
  - 40 + 30 + 2 + 4 = 76 gallons

Answer: 76 gallons
