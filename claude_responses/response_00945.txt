Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jon buys 2 coffees a day
* Each coffee costs $2
* We need to find out how much he spends in April

To calculate the total amount spent in April, we need to:
1. Calculate the daily cost of the coffees:
   * 2 coffees per day x $2 per coffee = $4 per day
2. Calculate the number of days in April:
   * April has 30 days
3. Multiply the daily cost by the number of days in April:
   * $4 per day x 30 days = $120

Therefore, the total amount Jon spends on coffee in April is:

Answer: 120
