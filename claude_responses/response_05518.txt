Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Bennett has 6 brothers.
2) We also know that the number of Bennett's brothers is two less than twice the number of Aaron's brothers.
3) Let's represent the number of Aaron's brothers as x.
4) Then, the number of Bennett's brothers is 2x - 2.
5) We know that 2x - 2 = 6, so we can solve for x.
6) 2x - 2 = 6
7) 2x = 8
8) x = 4
9) Therefore, the number of Aaron's brothers is 4.

Answer: 4
