Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peter has 4 horses
* Each horse eats 4 pounds of oats, twice a day
* So, each horse eats 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of oats per day
* Each horse also eats 3 pounds of grain once a day
* So, each horse eats 3 pounds of grain per day
* We need to calculate the total food needed for 3 days
* For oats:
  - Each horse eats 8 pounds per day
  - With 4 horses, that's 4 x 8 = 32 pounds per day
  - For 3 days, that's 32 x 3 = 96 pounds of oats
* For grain:
  - Each horse eats 3 pounds per day
  - With 4 horses, that's 4 x 3 = 12 pounds per day
  - For 3 days, that's 12 x 3 = 36 pounds of grain
* The total food needed is the sum of the oats and grain:
  - 96 pounds of oats + 36 pounds of grain = 132 pounds
