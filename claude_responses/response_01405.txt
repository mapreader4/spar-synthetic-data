Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 16 boys and 14 girls attending the party, for a total of 30 people.
2) Three-fourths of the 16 boys brought gifts. To calculate this, we take 3/4 * 16 = 12 boys brought gifts.
3) Six-sevenths of the 14 girls brought gifts. To calculate this, we take 6/7 * 14 = 12 girls brought gifts.
4) In total, 12 boys and 12 girls brought gifts, for a total of 24 people who brought gifts.
5) To find the number of people who did not bring gifts, we subtract the number of people who brought gifts from the total number of people attending: 30 - 24 = 6 people did not bring gifts.
