Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kirsty originally saved enough to buy 30 models at $0.45 each.
2) The total amount she saved was 30 * $0.45 = $13.50.
3) The price has now increased to $0.50 per model.
4) To calculate how many models she can buy with her $13.50, we divide $13.50 by the new price of $0.50 per model.
5) $13.50 / $0.50 = 27 models.

Answer: 27
