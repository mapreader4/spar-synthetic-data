Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first season, the apple tree produced 200 apples.

2. In the second season, the tree produced 20% fewer fruits than the first season. To calculate this, we take 20% of 200, which is 40. So, the tree produced 200 - 40 = 160 apples in the second season.

3. In the third season, the tree's fruit production doubled from the second season. So, if the tree produced 160 apples in the second season, it would produce 160 x 2 = 320 apples in the third season.

Now, to calculate the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons, we add up the number of apples produced in each season:
200 + 160 + 320 = 680

Answer: 680
