Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack gets 10 cents per bottle
* He recycled 80 bottles
* So, the amount he made from the bottles is:
    * 80 bottles x 10 cents per bottle = $8
* Jack made a total of $15 from recycling
* We know that the amount he made from the bottles is $8
* So, the remaining amount he made must be from the cans
* The amount he made from the cans is $15 - $8 = $7
* He gets 5 cents per can
* So, the number of cans he recycled is:
    * $7 / 5 cents per can = 140 cans

Answer: 140
