Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The population of Mojave was 4000 a decade ago.
2) The town's population has increased three times, so the current population is 4000 x 3 = 12,000.
3) The population analysis firm predicts that the population will increase by 40% after five years.
4) To calculate the population in five years, we take the current population of 12,000 and increase it by 40%:
12,000 + (12,000 x 0.40) = 12,000 + 4,800 = 16,800.

Answer: 16,800
