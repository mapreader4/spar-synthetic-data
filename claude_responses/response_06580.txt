Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The pool normally takes 50 hours to fill.
2) The hose runs at 100 gallons per hour.
3) To find the total number of gallons needed to fill the pool, we multiply the time (50 hours) by the rate (100 gallons per hour):
   50 hours x 100 gallons/hour = 5,000 gallons
4) Water costs 1 cent for 10 gallons.
5) To find the cost, we divide the total number of gallons (5,000) by 10, and then multiply by 1 cent:
   5,000 gallons / 10 gallons per cent = 500 cents
6) 500 cents = $5.00

Answer: $5.00
