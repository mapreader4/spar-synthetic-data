Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James has 10 shirts and 12 pairs of pants that need to be fixed.
2) It takes 1.5 hours to fix a shirt.
3) It takes twice as long to fix a pair of pants, which is 3 hours.
4) To find the total time it takes to fix all the shirts and pants, we can multiply the number of items by the time it takes to fix each one:
   - Shirts: 10 shirts x 1.5 hours = 15 hours
   - Pants: 12 pairs x 3 hours = 36 hours
   - Total time: 15 hours + 36 hours = 51 hours
5) The tailor charges $30 per hour.
6) To find the total cost, we multiply the total time by the hourly rate:
   - Total cost: 51 hours x $30 per hour = $1,530

Answer: $1,530
