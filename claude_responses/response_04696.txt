Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bus 1 has a capacity of 150 people
* Bus 1 is 60% full, which means it has 60% of 150 people = 0.6 * 150 = 90 people
* Bus 2 has a capacity of 150 people
* Bus 2 is 70% full, which means it has 70% of 150 people = 0.7 * 150 = 105 people
* To calculate the total number of employees in the two buses combined, we add the number of people in each bus:
* Total number of employees = 90 + 105 = 195

Answer: 195
