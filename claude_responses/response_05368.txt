Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lisa uses 30 pieces of pepperoni for the pizza
* She uses twice as many pieces of ham as pepperoni, so that's 2 x 30 = 60 pieces of ham
* She uses 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni, so that's 30 + 12 = 42 pieces of sausage
* In total, the number of pieces of meat used is 30 (pepperoni) + 60 (ham) + 42 (sausage) = 132 pieces
* The pizza is cut into 6 slices, so each slice will have an equal amount of meat
* To find the number of pieces of meat on each slice, we divide the total number of pieces (132) by the number of slices (6)
* 132 / 6 = 22

Answer: 22
