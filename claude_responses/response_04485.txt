Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The ice cream cone will melt in 10 minutes.
2) The beach is 16 blocks away, and each block is 1/8th of a mile.
3) To find the total distance to the beach, we multiply the number of blocks (16) by the distance per block (1/8 mile):
16 blocks x 1/8 mile per block = 2 miles
4) To find the speed Jack needs to jog, we divide the total distance (2 miles) by the time he has before the ice cream melts (10 minutes).
5) 2 miles / 10 minutes = 0.2 miles per minute
6) To convert this to miles per hour, we multiply by 60 minutes per hour:
0.2 miles per minute x 60 minutes per hour = 12 miles per hour
Answer: 12 miles per hour
