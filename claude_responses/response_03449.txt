Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that each apple tree can fill 20 baskets.
2) Each basket can be filled with 15 apples.
3) So, the number of apples that can be obtained from one tree is:
   20 baskets x 15 apples per basket = 300 apples
4) Now, we are asked to find the number of apples that can be obtained from 10 trees.
5) To do this, we multiply the number of apples per tree (300) by the number of trees (10).
6) 300 apples per tree x 10 trees = 3,000 apples

Answer: 3,000
