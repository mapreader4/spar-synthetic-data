Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farmer has a certain number of children
* Each child has a bag that was filled with 15 apples
* 2 children ate 4 apples each, so that's 8 apples eaten
* 1 child sold 7 of his apples
* They had a total of 60 apples left when they got home

To find the number of children, we need to first calculate the total number of apples they had before the 2 children ate and the 1 child sold some.

The total number of apples before the eating and selling:
* 60 apples left + 8 apples eaten + 7 apples sold = 75 apples

Now, we know that each child had a bag with 15 apples. So, the total number of apples they had is equal to the number of children multiplied by 15.

* 75 apples = number of children * 15 apples

Solving for the number of children:
* Number of children = 75 / 15 = 5
