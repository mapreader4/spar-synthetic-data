Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Gretchen charges $20.00 per drawing.
2. On Saturday, she sold 24 drawings.
   * 24 drawings x $20.00 per drawing = $480.00 made on Saturday.
3. On Sunday, she sold 16 drawings.
   * 16 drawings x $20.00 per drawing = $320.00 made on Sunday.
4. To calculate the total amount of money Gretchen made, we add the amounts from Saturday and Sunday:
   * $480.00 + $320.00 = $800.00

Answer: $800
