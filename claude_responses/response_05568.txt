Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary wants a total of 144 cupcakes for her party.
2) She has already made 36 cherry cupcakes and 48 berry cupcakes.
3) That means she has 144 - 36 - 48 = 60 cupcakes left to make.
4) Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the remaining 60 cupcakes.
5) Since 60 is an even number, Mary can make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes.

Answer: Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes.
