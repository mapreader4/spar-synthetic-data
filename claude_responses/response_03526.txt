Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The stand of apples is offering 10 apples for $2, which means each apple costs $0.20.
2) The stand of oranges is offering 5 oranges for $1.50, which means each orange costs $0.30.
3) The cheaper of the two fruits is the apple, which costs $0.20 per apple.
4) Jane wants to buy 12 of the cheaper fruit, which is the apple.
5) To calculate the total cost, we multiply the cost per apple ($0.20) by the number of apples (12):
$0.20 x 12 = $2.40
6) Converting the total cost from dollars to cents:
$2.40 x 100 cents/dollar = 240 cents

Answer: 240 cents
