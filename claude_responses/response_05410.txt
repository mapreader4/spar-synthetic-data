Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For the first trail:
* Distance: 20 miles
* Speed: 5 miles per hour
* Time to complete the trail: 20 miles / 5 miles per hour = 4 hours

For the second trail:
* Distance: 12 miles
* Speed: 3 miles per hour
* Time to complete the first half: 6 miles / 3 miles per hour = 2 hours
* Break time: 1 hour
* Time to complete the second half: 6 miles / 3 miles per hour = 2 hours
* Total time: 2 hours + 1 hour + 2 hours = 5 hours

Now, to find the difference in time between the two trails:
* Fastest hike time: 4 hours
* Slowest hike time: 5 hours
* Difference: 5 hours - 4 hours = 1 hour

Answer: 1 hour
