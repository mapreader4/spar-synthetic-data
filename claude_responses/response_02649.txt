Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cost of one Uno Giant Family Card is $12
* Ivan bought 10 pieces
* He was given a discount of $2 per card

To calculate the total amount Ivan paid, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the 10 cards without the discount:
   * 10 cards x $12 per card = $120
2. Calculate the total discount:
   * 10 cards x $2 discount per card = $20
3. Subtract the total discount from the total cost to get the final amount Ivan paid:
   * $120 - $20 = $100

Answer: $100
