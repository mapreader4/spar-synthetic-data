Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lorin has 4 black marbles.
2) Jimmy has 22 yellow marbles.
3) Alex has twice as many black marbles as Lorin, which means Alex has 2 x 4 = 8 black marbles.
4) Alex has one half as many yellow marbles as Jimmy, which means Alex has 22 / 2 = 11 yellow marbles.
5) Therefore, the total number of marbles Alex has is 8 black marbles + 11 yellow marbles = 19 marbles.

Answer: 19
