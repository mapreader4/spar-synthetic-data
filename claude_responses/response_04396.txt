Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. The forest is a rectangle measuring 4 miles by 6 miles.
2. Each square mile has 600 trees.
3. So the total number of trees in the forest is:
   * 4 miles x 6 miles = 24 square miles
   * 24 square miles x 600 trees per square mile = 14,400 trees
4. One logger can cut down 6 trees per day.
5. There are 8 loggers.
6. So the total number of trees cut down per day is:
   * 8 loggers x 6 trees per day = 48 trees per day
7. There are 30 days in each month.
8. So the number of trees cut down per month is:
   * 48 trees per day x 30 days = 1,440 trees per month
9. To find the number of months it will take to cut down all 14,400 trees, we divide 14,400 by 1,440:
   * 14,400 trees / 1,440 trees per month = 10 months

Answer: 10 months
