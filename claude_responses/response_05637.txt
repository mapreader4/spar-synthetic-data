Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mrs. Petersons bought 10 tumblers
2) Each tumbler costs $45
3) To calculate the total cost of the tumblers, we multiply the number of tumblers (10) by the cost per tumbler ($45):
   10 tumblers x $45 per tumbler = $450 total cost
4) Mrs. Petersons paid with five $100 bills, which is a total of $500
5) To calculate the change Mrs. Petersons will receive, we subtract the total cost ($450) from the amount she paid ($500):
   $500 - $450 = $50

Answer: $50
