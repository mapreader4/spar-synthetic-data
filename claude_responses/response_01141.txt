Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, the pet store owner had:
  - 12 birds
  - 9 puppies
  - 5 cats
  - 15 spiders
* Half the birds were sold, so the number of birds left is:
  - 12 - (12 / 2) = 6 birds
* 3 puppies were adopted, so the number of puppies left is:
  - 9 - 3 = 6 puppies
* 7 spiders went loose, so the number of spiders left is:
  - 15 - 7 = 8 spiders
* The number of cats remained the same at 5 cats
* Therefore, the total number of animals the pet store owner has left is:
  - 6 birds + 6 puppies + 5 cats + 8 spiders = 25 animals

Answer: 25
