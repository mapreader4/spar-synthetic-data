Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first hour, 7 leaves fell
* In the second and third hour, the leaves fell at a rate of 4 per hour
* So in the second hour, 4 leaves fell
* And in the third hour, 4 more leaves fell
* In total, 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 leaves fell
* The total time period was 3 hours
* To find the average number of leaves that fell per hour, we divide the total number of leaves (15) by the total number of hours (3)
* 15 leaves / 3 hours = 5 leaves per hour
