Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carla bought 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups
* Each bag was originally $6.00
* The bags were 75% off
* To calculate the discounted price per bag:
  - The original price was $6.00
  - The discount was 75%, which means the price was reduced by 75% of $6.00
  - 75% of $6.00 is 0.75 * $6.00 = $4.50
  - So the discounted price per bag is $6.00 - $4.50 = $1.50
* Since Carla bought 2 bags, the total amount she spent is:
  - 2 bags * $1.50 per bag = $3.00
