Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that Ms. Alice can grade 296 papers in 8 hours.
2) We want to find how many papers she can grade in 11 hours.
3) To do this, we need to find the rate at which Ms. Alice grades papers.
4) The rate at which she grades papers is 296 papers / 8 hours = 37 papers per hour.
5) Now, we can multiply the rate by the number of hours to find the number of papers she can grade in 11 hours.
6) 37 papers per hour * 11 hours = 407 papers.

Answer: 407
