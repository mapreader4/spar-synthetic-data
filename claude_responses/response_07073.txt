Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Leila spent 3/4 of her savings on make-up.
2) The remaining 1/4 of her savings was spent on a sweater that cost $20.
3) Let's call Leila's original savings "x".
4) 3/4 of x was spent on make-up, so 3/4 * x = amount spent on make-up.
5) The remaining 1/4 of x was spent on the sweater, which cost $20.
6) 1/4 * x = $20
7) Solving for x, we get x = $80.

Answer: 80
