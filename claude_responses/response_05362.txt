Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Euston had 20 more carriages than Norfolk.
2) Norwich had 100 carriages.
3) Flying Scotsman had 20 more carriages than Norwich.
4) Euston had 130 carriages.

Since Euston had 20 more carriages than Norfolk, we can say that Norfolk had 130 - 20 = 110 carriages.

Since Flying Scotsman had 20 more carriages than Norwich, we can say that Flying Scotsman had 100 + 20 = 120 carriages.

Now, to find the total number of carriages, we add up the carriages from each town:
Euston: 130 carriages
Norfolk: 110 carriages
Norwich: 100 carriages
Flying Scotsman: 120 carriages

Total carriages = 130 + 110 + 100 + 120 = 460 carriages.

Answer: 460
