Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jordan initially weighs 250 pounds
* For the first 4 weeks, he loses 3 pounds per week
* So, in the first 4 weeks, he loses 3 pounds x 4 weeks = 12 pounds
* After that, he loses 2 pounds per week for 8 weeks
* So, in the next 8 weeks, he loses 2 pounds x 8 weeks = 16 pounds
* In total, he has lost 12 pounds + 16 pounds = 28 pounds
* Therefore, his current weight is 250 pounds - 28 pounds = 222 pounds

Answer: 222 pounds
