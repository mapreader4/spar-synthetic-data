Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. and Mrs. Martin each get a regular scoop, which costs $4 each. So the total cost for their regular scoops is 2 x $4 = $8.
* Their two children each get a kiddie scoop, which costs $3 each. So the total cost for their kiddie scoops is 2 x $3 = $6.
* Their three teenage children each get a double scoop, which costs $6 each. So the total cost for their double scoops is 3 x $6 = $18.
* To calculate the total amount Mrs. Martin pays the cashier, we add up the costs for the regular scoops, kiddie scoops, and double scoops:
$8 + $6 + $18 = $32.

Answer: $32.
