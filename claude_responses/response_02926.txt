Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Apple can run at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
2) Mac can run at a rate of 4 miles per hour.
3) The race distance is 24 miles.
4) To calculate the time it takes for each person to run the 24 mile race, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Rate
5) For Apple, the time to run 24 miles would be:
Time = 24 miles / 3 miles per hour = 8 hours
6) For Mac, the time to run 24 miles would be:
Time = 24 miles / 4 miles per hour = 6 hours
7) The difference in time between Mac and Apple is:
8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours
8) Converting 2 hours to minutes:
2 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Answer: 120 minutes
