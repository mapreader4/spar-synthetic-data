Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. The first box has a capacity of 80 oranges and is filled 3/4 of the way full.
   * To calculate the number of oranges in the first box, we multiply the capacity (80) by the fraction of the box that is filled (3/4).
   * 80 * 3/4 = 60 oranges

2. The second box has a capacity of 50 oranges and is filled 3/5 of the way full.
   * To calculate the number of oranges in the second box, we multiply the capacity (50) by the fraction of the box that is filled (3/5).
   * 50 * 3/5 = 30 oranges

3. To find the total number of oranges in both boxes, we add the number of oranges in the first box (60) and the number of oranges in the second box (30).
   * 60 + 30 = 90 oranges

Answer: 90
