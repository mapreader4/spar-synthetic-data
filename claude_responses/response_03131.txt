Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) George paid $16 for the movie ticket.
2) The nachos were half the price of the ticket, which means the nachos cost $8 (half of $16).
3) To find the total amount George paid, we add the cost of the ticket ($16) and the cost of the nachos ($8).
4) $16 + $8 = $24.

Answer: $24
