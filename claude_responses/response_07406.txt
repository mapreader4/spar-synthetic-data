Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

First, let's calculate the total number of girls and boys from the 4th grade classes:
* 4th grade class 1: 12 girls + 13 boys = 25 total
* 4th grade class 2: 15 girls + 11 boys = 26 total
* Total 4th grade: 12 + 15 = 27 girls, 13 + 11 = 24 boys

Next, let's calculate the total number of girls and boys from the 5th grade classes:
* 5th grade class 1: 9 girls + 13 boys = 22 total
* 5th grade class 2: 10 girls + 11 boys = 21 total
* Total 5th grade: 9 + 10 = 19 girls, 13 + 11 = 24 boys

Now, let's calculate the total number of girls and boys across all classes:
* Total girls: 27 + 19 = 46
* Total boys: 24 + 24 = 48

Finally, to find the difference between the number of boys and girls:
* 48 boys - 46 girls = 2 more boys
