Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan.
2) Megan has 5 pieces of candy.
3) So, Mary must have 3 x 5 = 15 pieces of candy.
4) Mary then adds 10 more pieces of candy to her collection.
5) So, the total amount of candy Mary has is 15 + 10 = 25 pieces.

Answer: 25
