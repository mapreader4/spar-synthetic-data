Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there are 100 lions in Londolozi.
* Lion cubs are born at the rate of 5 per month.
* Lions die at the rate of 1 per month.
* We want to find the number of lions after 1 year (12 months).

First, let's calculate the number of lions born in 1 year:
* 5 cubs per month x 12 months = 60 cubs born in 1 year

Next, let's calculate the number of lions that die in 1 year:
* 1 lion per month x 12 months = 12 lions die in 1 year

Now, we can calculate the net change in the number of lions over 1 year:
* 60 cubs born - 12 lions died = 48 more lions

Finally, we can add this net change to the initial 100 lions:
* 100 lions + 48 more lions = 148 lions

Answer: 148 lions
