Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Bryan bought 3 bottles of milk
* The first bottle contains 2 liters of milk
* The second bottle contains 750 milliliters of milk
* The third bottle contains 250 milliliters of milk
* To find the total amount of milk bought, we need to convert the volumes to the same unit, which in this case will be liters.
* 1 liter = 1000 milliliters
* 750 milliliters = 0.75 liters
* 250 milliliters = 0.25 liters
* Adding up the volumes:
* 2 liters + 0.75 liters + 0.25 liters = 3 liters

Answer: 3 liters
