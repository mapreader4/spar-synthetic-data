Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Oliver has twice as many Monster Club cards as Alien Baseball cards. Let's call the number of Alien Baseball cards 'x'. Then the number of Monster Club cards is '2x'.
2) The number of Battle Gremlins cards is 48, and this is three times the size of the Alien Baseball card collection. So the number of Alien Baseball cards is 48 / 3 = 16. Therefore, 'x' = 16.
3) Since Oliver has twice as many Monster Club cards as Alien Baseball cards, and the number of Alien Baseball cards is 16, the number of Monster Club cards is 2 * 16 = 32.

Answer: 32
