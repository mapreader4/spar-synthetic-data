Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James has 20 years of experience
* 8 years ago, John had twice as much experience as James
* 8 years ago, John had 2 * 20 - 8 = 32 years of experience
* Mike started when John had 16 years of experience
* So, Mike has been working for 16 years
* John has 32 + 8 = 40 years of experience
* Mike has 16 years of experience
* James has 20 years of experience
* Their combined experience is:
Answer: 40 + 16 + 20 = 76 years
