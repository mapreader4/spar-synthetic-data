Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Owen bred 21 turtles
2) Johanna has 5 fewer turtles than Owen, so Johanna has 21 - 5 = 16 turtles
3) After 1 month, Owen has twice as many turtles as before, so Owen now has 21 x 2 = 42 turtles
4) Johanna loses half of her turtles, so she now has 16 / 2 = 8 turtles
5) Johanna donates the remaining 8 turtles to Owen
6) Therefore, the total number of turtles Owen has is 42 + 8 = 50

Answer: 50
