Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first day it rained 4 inches.
2. The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day. 
   - So, the second day it rained 4 x 5 = 20 inches.
3. The third day it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days.
   - The sum of the first two days is 4 + 20 = 24 inches.
   - The third day it rained 24 - 6 = 18 inches.

Answer: 18 inches.
