Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On Monday, Hallie works for 7 hours at $10/hour, so her base pay for Monday is:
7 hours x $10/hour = $70

On Monday, she also receives $18 in tips.
So her total earnings for Monday are:
$70 (base pay) + $18 (tips) = $88

On Tuesday, Hallie works for 5 hours at $10/hour, so her base pay for Tuesday is:
5 hours x $10/hour = $50

On Tuesday, she also receives $12 in tips.
So her total earnings for Tuesday are:
$50 (base pay) + $12 (tips) = $62

On Wednesday, Hallie works for 7 hours at $10/hour, so her base pay for Wednesday is:
7 hours x $10/hour = $70

On Wednesday, she also receives $20 in tips.
So her total earnings for Wednesday are:
$70 (base pay) + $20 (tips) = $90

Now, to calculate her total earnings from Monday to Wednesday, we add up the earnings for each day:
$88 (Monday) + $62 (Tuesday) + $90 (Wednesday) = $240

Answer: $240
