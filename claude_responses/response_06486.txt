Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janet has to drive 30 miles east to see her dermatologist.
2) Then she has to drive 50 miles west to see her gynecologist.
3) After her appointments, she has to drive back home, which is 30 miles west and then 50 miles east.
4) So the total distance she has to drive is:
   - 30 miles east + 50 miles west + 30 miles west + 50 miles east = 160 miles
5) Her car gets 20 miles per gallon.
6) To calculate the number of gallons of gas used, we divide the total distance by the miles per gallon:
   - 160 miles / 20 miles per gallon = 8 gallons of gas.
