Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Matt can paint the house in 12 hours.
2) Patty can paint the house in one-third the time of Matt, which means Patty can paint the house in 12 / 3 = 4 hours.
3) Rachel can paint the house in 5 more than double the amount of hours as Patty. 
4) Patty can paint the house in 4 hours, so double that is 8 hours.
5) 5 more than 8 hours is 13 hours.

Answer: 13 hours
