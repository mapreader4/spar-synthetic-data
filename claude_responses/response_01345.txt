Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Mimi spent a total of $8,000 on athletic sneakers and clothes.
2. She spent thrice as much on Nike sneakers as she did on Adidas.
3. The amount she spent on Adidas was 1/5 the cost of Skechers.
4. Mimi's Adidas sneakers purchase was $600.

Now, let's calculate the amounts spent on each item:
* Adidas sneakers: $600
* Nike sneakers: 3 x $600 = $1,800
* Skechers: 5 x $600 = $3,000

Now, we can calculate the amount spent on clothes:
* Total spent: $8,000
* Spent on sneakers: $600 + $1,800 + $3,000 = $5,400
* Spent on clothes: $8,000 - $5,400 = $2,600

Answer: $2,600
