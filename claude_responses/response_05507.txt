Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The weight bench can support 1000 pounds.
2) John wants to stay 20% under the weight capacity for safety.
3) To calculate 20% under the weight capacity, we take 1000 pounds and multiply it by 0.8 (100% - 20% = 80%).
4) 1000 pounds * 0.8 = 800 pounds.
5) John weighs 250 pounds.
6) To calculate the weight he can put on the bar, we take the maximum weight (800 pounds) and subtract his own weight (250 pounds).
7) 800 pounds - 250 pounds = 550 pounds.

Answer: 550
