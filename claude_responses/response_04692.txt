Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, they raked 5 bags of leaves
* On Tuesday, they raked 3 bags of leaves
* They charge $4 for each bag of leaves
* So on Monday, they earned 5 * $4 = $20
* And on Tuesday, they earned 3 * $4 = $12
* In total for Monday and Tuesday, they earned $20 + $12 = $32
* They had a total of $68 for all three days
* To find the amount they earned on Wednesday, we subtract the Monday and Tuesday earnings from the total:
* $68 - $32 = $36
* Since they charge $4 per bag, we can divide the Wednesday earnings by $4 to find the number of bags they raked on Wednesday:
* $36 / $4 = 9 bags
