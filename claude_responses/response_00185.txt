Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Caleb caught 2 trouts
* Caleb's dad caught three times as much as Caleb
* To find how many trouts Caleb's dad caught, we multiply Caleb's catch by 3:
  * 2 trouts x 3 = 6 trouts
* Now, to find how many more trouts Caleb's dad caught compared to Caleb, we subtract Caleb's catch from Caleb's dad's catch:
  * 6 trouts - 2 trouts = 4 trouts

Answer: 4
