Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Queenie earns $150 per day as a part-time clerk
* She earns an additional $5 per hour for overtime pay
* She worked 5 days
* She worked 4 hours of overtime

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the 5 days:
* 5 days x $150 per day = $750

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay:
* 4 hours of overtime x $5 per hour = $20

Finally, to get her total pay, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay:
* $750 + $20 = $770

Answer: 770
