Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* On Monday, Jeremy picks 100 oranges.
* On Tuesday, Jeremy and his brother pick thrice as much as Monday, which is 3 x 100 = 300 oranges.
* On Wednesday, Jeremy picks 70 oranges.

To find the total number of oranges, we add up the amounts from each day:
* Monday: 100 oranges
* Tuesday: 300 oranges
* Wednesday: 70 oranges

Total number of oranges = 100 + 300 + 70 = 470 oranges

Answer: 470
