Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Miggy's mom brought home 3 bags of birthday hats.
2) Each bag has 15 hats.
3) So the total number of hats brought home is 3 bags x 15 hats per bag = 45 hats.
4) Miggy accidentally tore off 5 hats.
5) So the total number of hats remaining is 45 hats - 5 torn hats = 40 hats.
6) During the party, only 25 hats were used.
7) Therefore, the number of hats that were unused is 40 hats - 25 used hats = 15 hats.

Answer: 15
