Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janna sleeps 7 hours each day during weekdays
* There are 5 weekdays in a week
* So, during the weekdays, Janna sleeps 7 hours x 5 days = 35 hours
* Janna sleeps 8 hours each day during weekends
* There are 2 weekend days in a week
* So, during the weekends, Janna sleeps 8 hours x 2 days = 16 hours
* To calculate the total hours Janna sleeps in a week, we add the hours from weekdays and weekends:
* 35 hours + 16 hours = 51 hours
