Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You have 3 gold coins, and each gold coin is worth $50
* So the value of the 3 gold coins is:
3 gold coins x $50 per coin = $150
* You have 5 silver coins, and each silver coin is worth $25
* So the value of the 5 silver coins is:
5 silver coins x $25 per coin = $125
* You also have $30 in cash
* To calculate the total amount of money you have, we add up the values of the gold coins, silver coins, and cash:
$150 + $125 + $30 = $305
Answer: 305
