Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. There are 1800 students at the university.
2. 30% of 1800 students are from other countries. To calculate this, we take 30% of 1800:
   * 30% of 1800 = 0.30 x 1800 = 540 foreign students

3. Next semester, 200 new foreign students will begin studying at the university.
4. To find the total number of foreign students after the 200 new students arrive, we add the original 540 foreign students to the 200 new foreign students:
   * 540 + 200 = 740 foreign students

Answer: 740 foreign students will study at the University.
