Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Clover goes for a 1.5-mile walk in the morning
* Clover goes for another 1.5-mile walk in the evening
* So, in one day, Clover walks a total of 1.5 miles + 1.5 miles = 3 miles
* We want to know how many miles Clover walks in 30 days
* To calculate this, we take the number of miles walked per day (3 miles) and multiply it by the number of days (30 days)
* 3 miles per day x 30 days = 90 miles

Answer: 90
