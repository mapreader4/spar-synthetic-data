Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Barbie can carry 4 coconuts at a time, and Bruno can carry 8 coconuts at a time.
2) Together, they can carry 4 + 8 = 12 coconuts per trip.
3) There are 144 coconuts in total that need to be moved.
4) To calculate the number of trips needed, we divide the total number of coconuts (144) by the number of coconuts carried per trip (12):
144 / 12 = 12 trips.

Answer: 12
