Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry's household can only use 1000 gallons of water during July
* Jerry uses 100 gallons for drinking and cooking
* Jerry uses 20 gallons per shower
* Jerry wants to fill his pool, which measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet
* Each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool

First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool:
* Volume of the pool = 10 feet x 10 feet x 6 feet = 600 cubic feet

Since each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, we know that Jerry can use 600 gallons of water to fill the pool.

Now, we need to calculate how many gallons of water Jerry has left for showers:
* Total water usage = 100 gallons (drinking and cooking) + 600 gallons (pool) = 700 gallons
* Remaining water for showers = 1000 gallons - 700 gallons = 300 gallons

Finally, we can calculate how many showers Jerry can take:
* Each shower uses 20 gallons
* 300 gallons / 20 gallons per shower = 15 showers

Answer: 15 showers
