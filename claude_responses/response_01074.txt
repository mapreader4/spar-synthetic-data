Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bathroom has 10 tiles along its width, each 6 inches wide.
2) The total width of the bathroom is therefore 10 tiles x 6 inches per tile = 60 inches.
3) The bathroom has 20 tiles along its length, each 6 inches long.
4) The total length of the bathroom is therefore 20 tiles x 6 inches per tile = 120 inches.
5) To calculate the square footage, we multiply the width (60 inches) by the length (120 inches).
6) 60 inches x 120 inches = 7,200 square inches.
7) To convert to square feet, we divide by 144 (since there are 144 square inches in 1 square foot).
8) 7,200 square inches / 144 = 50 square feet.
