Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hilton started with a box of 26 marbles
* He found 6 marbles while playing
* He then lost 10 marbles
* Lori gave him twice as many marbles as he lost

First, let's calculate how many marbles Hilton had after finding 6 and losing 10:
* 26 marbles (starting amount) + 6 marbles (found) - 10 marbles (lost) = 22 marbles

Now, Lori gave him twice as many marbles as he lost, which is 2 * 10 = 20 marbles.
* 22 marbles (after finding and losing) + 20 marbles (from Lori) = 42 marbles

Answer: 42
