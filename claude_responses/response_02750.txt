Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Zoe made a total of $8,000 from cleaning pools and babysitting
* She babysat Julie three times as often as she babysat Zachary
* The number of times she babysat Zachary was 1/5 the number of times she babysat Chloe
* Zoe made $600 babysitting Zachary

First, let's find out how much she made babysitting Zachary. We know she made $600 babysitting Zachary, so that's a given.

Next, let's find out how much she made babysitting Chloe. We know the number of times she babysat Zachary was 1/5 the number of times she babysat Chloe. So, if she made $600 babysitting Zachary, and that was 1/5 the number of times she babysat Chloe, then she made 5 times that amount babysitting Chloe, which is $3,000.

Now, we know she babysat Julie three times as often as she babysat Zachary. So, if she made $600 babysitting Zachary, and she babysat Julie three times as often, then she made three times that amount babysitting Julie, which is $1,800.

So, the total amount she made from babysitting is $600 + $3,000 + $1,800 = $5,400.

Now, we know she made a total of $8,000 from cleaning pools and babysitting. So, the amount she made from cleaning pools is the total ($8,000) minus the amount she made from babysitting ($5,400), which is $2,600.

Answer: $2,600
