Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The makeup set costs $65.
2) Gabby already has $35.
3) Gabby's mom gives her an additional $20.
4) To calculate how much money Gabby needs, we take the cost of the makeup set ($65) and subtract the amount of money Gabby already has ($35) and the additional $20 from her mom.
5) $65 - $35 - $20 = $10.
