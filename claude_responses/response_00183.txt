Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farm initially has:
  - 300 chickens
  - 200 turkeys
  - 80 guinea fowls
* The farmer loses the following each day:
  - 20 chickens
  - 8 turkeys
  - 5 guinea fowls
* After 1 week (7 days), the total losses will be:
  - Chickens: 20 x 7 = 140
  - Turkeys: 8 x 7 = 56
  - Guinea Fowls: 5 x 7 = 35
* So the remaining birds will be:
  - Chickens: 300 - 140 = 160
  - Turkeys: 200 - 56 = 144
  - Guinea Fowls: 80 - 35 = 45
* Adding up the remaining birds:
  - 160 + 144 + 45 = 349

Answer: 349
