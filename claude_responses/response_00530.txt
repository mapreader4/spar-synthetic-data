Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Pat has 42 cookies, 63 pieces of candy, and 21 brownies.
2) There are 7 people in her family.
3) We need to divide the total number of desserts evenly among the 7 people.
4) The total number of desserts is 42 cookies + 63 pieces of candy + 21 brownies = 126 desserts.
5) To find how many desserts each person will get, we divide the total number of desserts (126) by the number of people (7).
6) 126 รท 7 = 18

Answer: 18
