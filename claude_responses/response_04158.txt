Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Reyna had 20 lamps, and each lamp had 7 light bulbs.
2) So the total number of light bulbs is 20 lamps x 7 light bulbs per lamp = 140 light bulbs.
3) 1/4 of the lamps have 2 burnt-out light bulbs each.
4) 1/4 of 20 lamps is 5 lamps.
5) 5 lamps with 2 burnt-out light bulbs each means 5 x 2 = 10 burnt-out light bulbs.
6) The total number of working light bulbs is the total number of light bulbs (140) minus the number of burnt-out light bulbs (10).
7) 140 - 10 = 130 working light bulbs.

Answer: 130
