Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total number of photos is 152.
2) Tim has 100 photos less than the total, which means Tim has 152 - 100 = 52 photos.
3) Paul has 10 photos more than Tim, which means Paul has 52 + 10 = 62 photos.
4) Since the total number of photos is 152, and Tim has 52 photos and Paul has 62 photos, the remaining photos must belong to Tom.
5) To find the number of photos Tom has, we can subtract the number of photos Tim and Paul have from the total:
152 - 52 - 62 = 38

Answer: 38
