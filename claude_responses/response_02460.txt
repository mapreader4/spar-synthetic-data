Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenna gets paid $0.40 per mile.
2) She drives 400 miles one way.
3) For a round trip, she would drive 400 miles back, so the total distance is 400 miles + 400 miles = 800 miles.
4) To calculate her pay for the round trip, we multiply the total distance (800 miles) by the pay rate ($0.40 per mile).
5) 800 miles x $0.40 per mile = $320.

Answer: $320.
