Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Betty ordered 6 pieces of slippers that cost $2.5 each.
   * Total cost of slippers = 6 x $2.5 = $15

2. Betty ordered 4 pieces of lipstick that cost $1.25 each.
   * Total cost of lipstick = 4 x $1.25 = $5

3. Betty ordered 8 pieces of hair color that cost $3 each.
   * Total cost of hair color = 8 x $3 = $24

4. To calculate the total amount Betty paid, we add up the costs of the three items:
   * Total amount paid = $15 + $5 + $24 = $44

Answer: $44
