Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Samira has 4 dozen water bottles in her box
* 1 dozen = 12 bottles
* So Samira has 4 x 12 = 48 water bottles in her box
* In the first break, the 11 players each take 2 bottles
* So the total number of bottles taken in the first break is 11 x 2 = 22 bottles
* At the end of the game, each of the 11 players takes 1 more bottle
* So the total number of bottles taken at the end of the game is 11 x 1 = 11 bottles
* The total number of bottles taken is 22 + 11 = 33 bottles
* The initial number of bottles was 48
* So the number of bottles remaining in Samira's box is 48 - 33 = 15 bottles
