Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The maximum load on a truck is 900 kilograms.
2) Each bag of lemons has a mass of 8 kilograms.
3) There are 100 bags of lemons.
4) To calculate the total mass of the 100 bags of lemons, we multiply the number of bags (100) by the mass of each bag (8 kilograms):
100 bags x 8 kilograms/bag = 800 kilograms
5) The maximum load on the truck is 900 kilograms, and the total mass of the 100 bags of lemons is 800 kilograms.
6) To calculate the additional kilograms that can still be loaded into the truck, we subtract the total mass of the lemons from the maximum load:
900 kilograms - 800 kilograms = 100 kilograms

Answer: 100
