Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jaime saves $50 per week
* Every two weeks, she spends $46 on a lunch with her mum
* We need to find how long it will take her to save $135

First, let's calculate how much she saves in a two-week period:
* 2 weeks x $50 per week = $100 saved

Next, we need to account for the $46 she spends on the lunch:
* $100 saved - $46 spent = $54 net savings per two-week period

Now, we can calculate how many two-week periods it will take her to save $135:
* $135 / $54 per two-week period = 2.5 two-week periods

Since we can't have a fractional number of two-week periods, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:
* 2.5 two-week periods rounds up to 3 two-week periods

Therefore, it will take Jaime 3 two-week periods, or 6 weeks, to save $135.
