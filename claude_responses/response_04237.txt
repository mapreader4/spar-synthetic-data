Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total length of the race is 74.5 kilometers.
2) The first part of the race is 15.5 kilometers long.
3) The second and third parts are each 21.5 kilometers long.
4) To find the length of the last part, we need to subtract the lengths of the first three parts from the total length of the race.
5) The length of the first three parts is: 15.5 + 21.5 + 21.5 = 58.5 kilometers.
6) The total length of the race is 74.5 kilometers.
7) So the length of the last part is: 74.5 - 58.5 = 16 kilometers.

Answer: 16 kilometers.
