Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The teacher teaches 5 periods a day
* The teacher works 24 days a month
* The teacher is paid $5 per period
* The teacher has been working for 6 months

To calculate the total amount the teacher has earned, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of periods the teacher teaches in a month:
   * 5 periods per day x 24 days per month = 120 periods per month
2. Calculate the amount the teacher earns in a month:
   * 120 periods per month x $5 per period = $600 per month
3. Calculate the total amount the teacher has earned in 6 months:
   * $600 per month x 6 months = $3,600

Answer: $3,600
