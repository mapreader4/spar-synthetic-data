Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Charlie and Susan were already in the bedroom
* Sarah entered the bedroom with 4 friends
* So in the bedroom, there are now 2 (Charlie and Susan) + 1 (Sarah) + 4 (Sarah's friends) = 7 people
* Additionally, there were 8 people in the living room
* To find the total number of people in the house, we add the number of people in the bedroom and the number of people in the living room:
* 7 (in the bedroom) + 8 (in the living room) = 15 people

Answer: 15
