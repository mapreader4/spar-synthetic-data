Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Carmen sold 3 boxes of Samoas to the green house for $4 each. So, the total for the Samoas is:
3 boxes x $4 per box = $12

2. Carmen sold 2 boxes of Thin Mints to the yellow house for $3.50 each, and 1 box of Fudge Delights for $5. So, the total for the Thin Mints and Fudge Delights is:
(2 boxes x $3.50 per box) + (1 box x $5 per box) = $7 + $5 = $12

3. Carmen sold 9 boxes of Sugar Cookies to the brown house for $2 each. So, the total for the Sugar Cookies is:
9 boxes x $2 per box = $18

4. To calculate the total amount of money Carmen made, we add up the totals from each sale:
$12 + $12 + $18 = $42

Answer: $42
