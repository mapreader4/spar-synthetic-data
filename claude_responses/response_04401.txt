Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alice needs to sell $1000 of shoes to meet her quota
* Adidas cost $45 each, Nike cost $60 each, and Reeboks cost $35 each
* She sells:
  - 8 Nikes at $60 each, so 8 * $60 = $480
  - 6 Adidas at $45 each, so 6 * $45 = $270
  - 9 Reeboks at $35 each, so 9 * $35 = $315
* The total amount of shoes she sold is:
  - $480 + $270 + $315 = $1065
* To find how much she is short or above her goal, we subtract $1000 (her quota) from $1065 (the total amount of shoes she sold):
  - $1065 - $1000 = $65

Answer: $65
