Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The ratio of books to pens that Arlo has to buy is 7:3.
2) This means that for every 10 stationery items, 7 are books and 3 are pens.
3) We know that Arlo bought a total of 400 stationery items.
4) To find the number of books, we need to find what 7/10 of 400 is.
5) 7/10 of 400 = 0.7 * 400 = 280.

Answer: 280
