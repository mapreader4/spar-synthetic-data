Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Jesiah's cows produce 200 gallons of milk every day
* The expenses for maintenance and feed are $3000 per month
* He sells 1 gallon of milk at $3.55

To calculate his total income in June, we need to:
1. Calculate the total milk production in June
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the milk
3. Subtract the monthly expenses from the total revenue

Step 1: Total milk production in June
* There are 30 days in June
* 200 gallons of milk per day x 30 days = 6,000 gallons of milk

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the milk
* 6,000 gallons of milk x $3.55 per gallon = $21,300

Step 3: Subtract the monthly expenses
* Total revenue: $21,300
* Monthly expenses: $3,000
* Total income: $21,300 - $3,000 = $18,300

Answer: $18,300
