Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Mary and Jimmy start running from the same spot, but in opposite directions.
2) Mary runs at 5 miles per hour, and Jimmy runs at 4 miles per hour.
3) After 1 hour, Mary will have run 5 miles in one direction, and Jimmy will have run 4 miles in the opposite direction.
4) The total distance between them is the sum of the distances they have each run, which is 5 miles + 4 miles = 9 miles.

Answer: 9 miles
