Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The first generation of kittens has tails that are 16 cm long.
2) Each subsequent generation has tails that are 25% longer than the previous generation.
3) To find the length of the third generation's tails, we need to calculate the length of the second generation's tails first.
4) The second generation's tails are 25% longer than the first generation's tails. 
5) 25% of 16 cm is 0.25 * 16 = 4 cm.
6) So the second generation's tails are 16 cm + 4 cm = 20 cm long.
7) The third generation's tails are 25% longer than the second generation's tails.
8) 25% of 20 cm is 0.25 * 20 = 5 cm.
9) So the third generation's tails are 20 cm + 5 cm = 25 cm long.

Answer: 25 cm
