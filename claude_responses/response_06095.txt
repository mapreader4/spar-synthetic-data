Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Beau's sons are triplets, so they are all 16 years old today.
2) Three years ago, the sum of his 3 sons' ages equaled Beau's age.
3) Three years ago, the triplets were 13 years old.
4) The sum of their ages three years ago was 3 * 13 = 39.
5) Therefore, Beau's age three years ago was 39.
6) Beau's age today is 39 + 3 = 42.

Answer: 42
