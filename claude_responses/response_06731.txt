Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rebecca is 25 years old.
2) Brittany is 3 years older than Rebecca, so Brittany is 25 + 3 = 28 years old.
3) Brittany goes on a 4-year vacation.
4) To find Brittany's age when she returns from her vacation, we add the 4 years of the vacation to her original age of 28.
5) 28 + 4 = 32

Answer: 32
