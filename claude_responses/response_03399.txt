Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The American flag has 13 stripes
* The first stripe is red
* Half of the remaining stripes are also red
* So, the number of red stripes on one flag is:
  - 1 (the first stripe)
  - Plus half of the remaining 12 stripes, which is 6
  - Therefore, the total number of red stripes on one flag is 1 + 6 = 7
* John buys 10 flags
* To find the total number of red stripes, we multiply the number of red stripes per flag (7) by the number of flags (10)
* 7 red stripes per flag x 10 flags = 70 red stripes

Answer: 70
