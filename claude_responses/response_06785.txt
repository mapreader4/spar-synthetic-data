Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hannah bought 3 sweatshirts, each costing $15
* So the total cost of the sweatshirts is 3 * $15 = $45
* Hannah also bought 2 T-shirts, each costing $10
* So the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $10 = $20
* To find the total amount of money Hannah spent, we add the cost of the sweatshirts and the T-shirts:
* $45 + $20 = $65

Answer: 65
