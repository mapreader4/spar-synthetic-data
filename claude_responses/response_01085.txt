Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lily has 4 siblings
* Each of her 4 siblings is bringing 2 suitcases
* So, the total number of suitcases brought by the 4 siblings is:
  * 4 siblings x 2 suitcases each = 8 suitcases
* Lily's parents are bringing 3 suitcases
* Lily is not bringing any suitcases
* To find the total number of suitcases the entire family is bringing, we add the suitcases brought by the siblings and the parents:
  * 8 suitcases (siblings) + 3 suitcases (parents) = 11 suitcases

Answer: 11
