Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Bingley initially has 5 bracelets.
2) Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets. A fourth of 16 is 4, so Bingley now has 5 + 4 = 9 bracelets.
3) Bingley then gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister. A third of 9 is 3, so Bingley now has 9 - 3 = 6 bracelets remaining.
