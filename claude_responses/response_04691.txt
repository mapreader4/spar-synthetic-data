Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerry took 8 hours to paint the house.
2) The time it took him to fix the broken kitchen counter was three times longer than the time he took painting the house. 
   * So, the time it took him to fix the broken kitchen counter was 3 x 8 = 24 hours.
3) After painting the house, Jerry helped mow Miss Stevie's lawn, taking 6 hours.
4) The total time Jerry worked was:
   * Painting the house: 8 hours
   * Fixing the kitchen counter: 24 hours
   * Mowing the lawn: 6 hours
   * Total time: 8 + 24 + 6 = 38 hours
5) Jerry charged Miss Stevie $15 per hour of work.
6) The total amount Miss Stevie paid Jerry was:
   * 38 hours x $15 per hour = $570

Answer: $570
