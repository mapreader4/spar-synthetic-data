Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Liezl prepared 4 sets of 2-dozen paper cups
* 2-dozen means 2 x 12 = 24 cups per set
* So, the total number of cups prepared is 4 x 24 = 96 cups
* 5 cups were damaged and not used
* 30 cups were not used
* To find the number of cups that were used, we need to subtract the damaged and unused cups from the total cups prepared:
* Total cups prepared: 96
* Damaged cups: 5
* Unused cups: 30
* Cups used = 96 - 5 - 30 = 61

Answer: 61
