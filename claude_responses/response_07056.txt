Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 30 students in the general study hall.
2) There are twice as many students in the biology hall as in the general study hall. So, the number of students in the biology hall is 2 x 30 = 60.
3) The number of students in the math hall is 3/5 times the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall.
4) The combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall is 30 + 60 = 90.
5) The number of students in the math hall is 3/5 x 90 = 54.
6) The total number of students in all the halls combined is the sum of the students in the general study hall, the biology hall, and the math hall:
30 + 60 + 54 = 144.

Answer: 144
