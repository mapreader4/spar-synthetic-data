Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hannah fills each kid's stocking with 4 candy canes
* She also puts 2 beanie babies in each stocking
* And 1 book in each stocking
* She has 3 kids
* To calculate the total number of stocking stuffers she buys:
* For the candy canes, she needs 4 per kid, so 4 x 3 = 12 candy canes
* For the beanie babies, she needs 2 per kid, so 2 x 3 = 6 beanie babies
* For the books, she needs 1 per kid, so 1 x 3 = 3 books
* Adding up the total:
* 12 candy canes + 6 beanie babies + 3 books = 21 stocking stuffers
