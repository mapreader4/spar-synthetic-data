Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Jack goes hunting 6 times a month
* The hunting season lasts for 1 quarter of the year (3 months)
* He catches 2 deers each time he goes hunting
* Each deer weighs 600 pounds
* He keeps half the weight of the deer a year

First, let's calculate the total number of deers he catches in a year:
* 6 times a month x 3 months = 18 times a year
* 2 deers each time x 18 times a year = 36 deers a year

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the deers he catches in a year:
* 36 deers a year x 600 pounds per deer = 21,600 pounds of deer a year

Finally, he keeps half the weight of the deer a year, so:
* 21,600 pounds of deer a year / 2 = 10,800 pounds of deer he keeps a year

Answer: 10,800 pounds
