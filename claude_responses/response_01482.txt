Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Donna can watch 8 episodes each day during weekdays
* On each weekend day, she can watch three times the number of episodes she can watch on the weekdays
* So, on each weekend day, she can watch 3 x 8 = 24 episodes

Now, let's calculate the total number of episodes she can watch in a week:
* Weekdays: 8 episodes per day x 5 days = 40 episodes
* Weekends: 24 episodes per day x 2 days = 48 episodes
* Total episodes in a week = 40 + 48 = 88 episodes

Answer: 88
