Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hannah makes $30 per hour
2) She works 18 hours per week
3) Her total pay before any deductions would be:
   * 18 hours per week x $30 per hour = $540 per week
4) However, she was late 3 times this week
5) Each time she was late, she was docked $5
6) So the total deduction for being late is:
   * 3 times late x $5 per time = $15
7) Therefore, her final pay for the week is:
   * $540 - $15 = $525

Answer: $525
