Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The banana plantation on Jakies Island can produce ten times as many bananas as the plantation on the nearby island.
2) The banana plantation on the nearby island produced 9000 bananas in a year.
3) To find the total banana produce from the two islands, we need to add the production from the nearby island and the production from Jakies Island.
4) The production from the nearby island is 9000 bananas.
5) The production from Jakies Island is 10 times the production from the nearby island, which is 10 * 9000 = 90,000 bananas.
6) The total banana produce from the two islands is 9000 + 90,000 = 99,000 bananas.

Answer: 99,000
