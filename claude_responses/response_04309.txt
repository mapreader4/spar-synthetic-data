Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The road is 2000 feet long and 20 feet wide, so the total area of the road is:
2000 feet x 20 feet = 40,000 square feet
2) Each truckload of asphalt covers 800 square feet of road.
3) To calculate the number of truckloads needed, we divide the total area of the road by the area covered by each truckload:
40,000 square feet / 800 square feet per truckload = 50 truckloads
4) Each truckload of asphalt costs $75.
5) To calculate the total cost of the asphalt before tax, we multiply the number of truckloads by the cost per truckload:
50 truckloads x $75 per truckload = $3,750
6) There is a 20% sales tax, so we need to calculate the tax amount:
$3,750 x 0.20 = $750
7) To calculate the total amount Mark needs to pay, we add the cost of the asphalt and the sales tax:
$3,750 + $750 = $4,500

Answer: $4,500
