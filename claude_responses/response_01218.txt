Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John is buying a pair of Nikes that cost $150 and a pair of work boots that cost $120.
2) The total cost of the two items before tax is $150 + $120 = $270.
3) The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is 10% of $270, which is 0.10 * $270 = $27.
4) The total amount John paid is the cost of the items plus the tax, which is $270 + $27 = $297.

Answer: 297
