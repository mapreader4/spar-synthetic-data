Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The total average age of the three friends is 40.
* Jared is 10 years older than Hakimi.
* Molly's age is 30.

Let's call Hakimi's age 'x'.
* Jared's age = x + 10
* Molly's age = 30
* Total age = x + (x + 10) + 30 = 3 * 40 = 120
* Solving for x, we get:
* 2x + 40 = 120
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Therefore, Hakimi's age is 40.

Answer: 40
