Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kyle baked 60 cookies and 32 brownies
* Kyle ate 2 cookies and 2 brownies
* Kyle's mom ate 1 cookie and 2 brownies
* So the remaining cookies and brownies are:
    - Cookies: 60 - 2 - 1 = 57 cookies
    - Brownies: 32 - 2 - 2 = 28 brownies
* Kyle sells each cookie for $1 and each brownie for $1.50
* To calculate the total money Kyle will make:
    - Cookies: 57 cookies x $1 = $57
    - Brownies: 28 brownies x $1.50 = $42
* Adding the money from cookies and brownies:
    - $57 + $42 = $99

Answer: $99
