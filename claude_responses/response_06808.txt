Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Crabby has to eat at least twice as many oysters as Squido.
2) Squido eats 200 oysters.
3) Since Crabby has to eat at least twice as many as Squido, we can calculate Crabby's minimum number of oysters as:
   Crabby's minimum oysters = 2 * 200 = 400 oysters
4) To find the total number of oysters eaten, we add Squido's and Crabby's oysters:
   Total oysters eaten = Squido's oysters + Crabby's oysters
   Total oysters eaten = 200 + 400 = 600 oysters

Answer: 600
