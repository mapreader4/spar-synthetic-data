Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jon gets paid $0.10 for every person who visits his website
* Each hour he gets 50 visits
* His website operates 24 hours a day
* So in a 24-hour day, he gets 50 visits per hour x 24 hours = 1,200 visits per day
* In a 30-day month, he gets 1,200 visits per day x 30 days = 36,000 visits in the month
* Since he gets paid $0.10 per visit, for 36,000 visits he would make:
* 36,000 visits x $0.10 per visit = $3,600

Answer: $3,600
