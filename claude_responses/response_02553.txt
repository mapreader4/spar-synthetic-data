Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Connor sleeps 6 hours a night
* Luke sleeps 2 hours longer than Connor
* If Connor sleeps 6 hours, then Luke sleeps 6 + 2 = 8 hours
* The puppy sleeps twice as long as Luke
* If Luke sleeps 8 hours, then the puppy sleeps 8 x 2 = 16 hours

Answer: 16 hours
