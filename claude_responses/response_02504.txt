Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elsie starts with a specific amount of wet wipes in the morning
* Throughout the day, she uses up 20 wipes and then refills the container with 10 more wipes
* By nighttime, she has 60 wipes left

Let's call the initial amount of wipes in the morning "x".
* She uses up 20 wipes, so she has x - 20 wipes left
* She then refills the container with 10 more wipes, so she has x - 20 + 10 = x - 10 wipes
* By nighttime, she has 60 wipes left, so x - 10 = 60
* Solving for x, we get x = 70

Therefore, the amount of wipes in the container in the morning was 70.

Answer: 70
