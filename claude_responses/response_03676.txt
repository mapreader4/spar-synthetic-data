Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tabitha adds 1 serving of honey per cup of tea
* She usually has 2 cups of tea before bed
* So, she uses 2 servings of honey per night
* She buys her honey in a 16-ounce container
* There are 6 servings of honey per ounce
* So, in a 16-ounce container, there are 16 * 6 = 96 servings of honey

Now, to calculate how many nights she can enjoy honey in her tea before bed, we divide the total number of servings (96) by the number of servings she uses per night (2):

96 servings / 2 servings per night = 48 nights

Answer: 48
