Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Billy buys a 12 pack of soda.
2) He has twice as many brothers as sisters.
3) He has 2 sisters.
4) To find the number of brothers, we can multiply the number of sisters by 2:
   * 2 sisters x 2 = 4 brothers
5) So in total, Billy has 4 brothers and 2 sisters, for a total of 6 siblings.
6) To divide the 12 sodas equally among his 6 siblings, we can divide 12 by 6:
   * 12 sodas รท 6 siblings = 2 sodas per sibling.
