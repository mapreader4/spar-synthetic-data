Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John needs to replace both of his hearing aids
* Each hearing aid costs $2500
* So the total cost for both hearing aids is:
    * 2 x $2500 = $5000
* Insurance covers 80% of the cost
* To calculate the amount covered by insurance:
    * 80% of $5000 = 0.8 x $5000 = $4000
* To calculate the amount John has to pay personally:
    * Total cost - Amount covered by insurance = $5000 - $4000 = $1000
* Therefore, the amount John has to pay personally is:
Answer: $1000
