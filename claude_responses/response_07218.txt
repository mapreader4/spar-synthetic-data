Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adrianna originally had 10 pieces of gum.
2) She then went to the store and got 3 more pieces of gum.
3) So the total number of pieces of gum Adrianna had was 10 + 3 = 13.
4) She then gave out gum to 11 friends.
5) To find out how many pieces of gum Adrianna has now, we need to subtract the number of pieces she gave out from the total number of pieces she had.
6) 13 pieces of gum - 11 pieces given out = 2 pieces of gum remaining.
