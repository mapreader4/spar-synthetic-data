Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jorge has an equal number of baseball cards as Matias.
2) Matias has 6 fewer cards than Carlos.
3) Carlos has 20 baseball cards.
4) Since Matias has 6 fewer cards than Carlos, Matias has 20 - 6 = 14 baseball cards.
5) Since Jorge has an equal number of cards as Matias, Jorge also has 14 baseball cards.
6) To find the total number of baseball cards the three have, we add up the number of cards each person has:
Carlos: 20 cards
Matias: 14 cards
Jorge: 14 cards
Total: 20 + 14 + 14 = 48 cards

Answer: 48
