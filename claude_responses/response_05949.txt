Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Logan's father normally receives 50 cartons of milk, with each carton having 20 jars of milk.
* So the normal total number of jars of milk received is:
    * 50 cartons x 20 jars/carton = 1,000 jars of milk
* However, on this particular week, he received 20 cartons less.
    * So he received 50 - 20 = 30 cartons
* Each of these 30 cartons had 20 jars of milk.
    * So the total number of jars of milk received this week is:
        * 30 cartons x 20 jars/carton = 600 jars of milk
* Now, we need to account for the damaged jars and carton.
    * 3 jars were damaged in each of 5 cartons.
        * So the total number of damaged jars is:
            * 3 jars/carton x 5 cartons = 15 damaged jars
    * 1 carton was totally damaged.
        * This carton had 20 jars of milk.
* So the total number of good jars of milk for sale that week is:
    * 600 jars - 15 damaged jars - 20 jars in the totally damaged carton = 565 jars of milk
