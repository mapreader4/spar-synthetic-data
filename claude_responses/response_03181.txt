Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The sheep can run 12 feet per second
* The dog can run 20 feet per second
* The sheep is 160 feet away from the dog
* The dog runs after the sheep that has bolted
* To find the time it takes for the dog to catch the sheep, we need to calculate the time it takes for the dog to cover the 160 feet distance
* The dog's speed is 20 feet per second
* So, the time it takes for the dog to cover the 160 feet distance is:
* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 160 feet / 20 feet per second
* Time = 8 seconds

Answer: 8 seconds
