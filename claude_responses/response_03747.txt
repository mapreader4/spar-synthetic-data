Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The teacher had $100 to spend.
2) A basic calculator costs $8.
3) A scientific calculator costs twice the price of the basic calculator, which is $16.
4) A graphing calculator costs thrice the price of the scientific calculator, which is $48.
5) To find the total cost of the three calculators, we add up the prices:
   $8 + $16 + $48 = $72
6) To find the change the teacher received, we subtract the total cost from the initial $100:
   $100 - $72 = $28

Answer: $28
