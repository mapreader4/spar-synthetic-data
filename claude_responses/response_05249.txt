Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ginger has 2 children
* She bakes a cake for each child on their birthdays, Christmas, Easter, and Halloween
* That's 4 cakes per child per year
* 2 children x 4 cakes per child per year = 8 cakes per year for the children
* She has a husband
* She makes a cake for him on their birthdays, Christmas, Easter, Halloween, anniversary, and Valentine's Day
* That's 6 cakes per year for her husband
* She also makes cakes for her parents, but only on their birthdays
* That's 2 cakes per year for her parents
* In total, that's:
    - 8 cakes per year for the children
    - 6 cakes per year for her husband
    - 2 cakes per year for her parents
    - 8 + 6 + 2 = 16 cakes per year
* Over 10 years, that's:
    - 16 cakes per year x 10 years = 160 cakes

Answer: 160
