Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Let's say the time it took Dad to vacuum downstairs is x minutes.
* Then, the time it took Dad to vacuum upstairs is 2x + 5 minutes.
* The total time Dad spent vacuuming is 38 minutes.
* So, we can write the equation:
x + (2x + 5) = 38
* Solving for x:
3x + 5 = 38
3x = 33
x = 11
* Therefore, the time it took Dad to vacuum downstairs is 11 minutes.
* And the time it took Dad to vacuum upstairs is 2(11) + 5 = 27 minutes.

Answer: 27 minutes.
