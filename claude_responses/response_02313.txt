Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Christian is twice as old as Brian. This means that if Brian's age is x, then Christian's age is 2x.
2) In eight more years, Brian will be 40 years old. This means that Brian's current age is 40 - 8 = 32 years old.
3) Since Christian is twice as old as Brian, and Brian is 32 years old, then Christian is currently 2 * 32 = 64 years old.
4) In eight years, Christian will be 64 + 8 = 72 years old.

Answer: 72
