Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim gets the maximum $1200 donation from 500 people
* This means the total amount from the $1200 donations is:
  * 500 people x $1200 = $600,000
* Three times as many people donated half this sum of money
* So, the number of people who donated half the sum is:
  * 3 x 500 = 1,500 people
* The amount donated by each of these 1,500 people is:
  * $1200 / 2 = $600
* The total amount from the $600 donations is:
  * 1,500 people x $600 = $900,000
* The total amount from both the $1200 and $600 donations is:
  * $600,000 + $900,000 = $1,500,000
* These donations together accounted for 40% of the total money that Tim raised
* To find the total money raised, we need to divide the $1,500,000 by 40% (or 0.4)
* $1,500,000 / 0.4 = $3,750,000

Answer: $3,750,000
