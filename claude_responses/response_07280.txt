Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vaishali's Saree has 4 brown stripes
* There are three times as many gold stripes as brown stripes
* So, if there are 4 brown stripes, then there must be 3 x 4 = 12 gold stripes
* There are five times as many blue stripes as gold stripes
* So, if there are 12 gold stripes, then there must be 5 x 12 = 60 blue stripes

Answer: 60
