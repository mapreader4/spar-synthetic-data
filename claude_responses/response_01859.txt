Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janet reads 80 pages per day
* Belinda reads 30 pages per day
* We want to find how many more pages Janet reads in 6 weeks

First, let's calculate how many pages Janet reads in 6 weeks:
* 6 weeks = 42 days (assuming 7 days per week)
* Janet reads 80 pages per day
* So, Janet reads 80 pages x 42 days = 3,360 pages in 6 weeks

Next, let's calculate how many pages Belinda reads in 6 weeks:
* Belinda reads 30 pages per day
* So, Belinda reads 30 pages x 42 days = 1,260 pages in 6 weeks

Finally, to find how many more pages Janet reads compared to Belinda, we subtract Belinda's pages from Janet's pages:
* 3,360 pages - 1,260 pages = 2,100 pages

Answer: 2,100
