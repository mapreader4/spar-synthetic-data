Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Farmer Randy has 1700 acres of cotton to be planted in 5 days
* He has a crew of 2 tractors working for the first 2 days
* Then he has a crew of 7 tractors working for the next 3 days
* To find the number of acres each tractor needs to plant per day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of tractor-days available
2. Divide the total acres by the total tractor-days to get the acres per tractor-day

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tractor-days available
* 2 tractors working for 2 days = 4 tractor-days
* 7 tractors working for 3 days = 21 tractor-days
* Total tractor-days = 4 + 21 = 25 tractor-days

Step 2: Divide the total acres by the total tractor-days to get the acres per tractor-day
* Total acres = 1700
* Total tractor-days = 25
* Acres per tractor-day = 1700 / 25 = 68

Therefore, each tractor needs to plant 68 acres per day to meet the planting deadline.

Answer: 68
