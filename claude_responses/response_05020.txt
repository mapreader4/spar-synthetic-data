Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Alice's basic monthly salary is $240.
2. She sold $2500 worth of gadgets, and she receives a 2% commission on these sales.
3. To calculate the commission, we take 2% of $2500, which is 0.02 * $2500 = $50.
4. So her total earnings for the month are her basic salary ($240) plus her commission ($50), which is $240 + $50 = $290.
5. She usually saves 10% of her total earnings.
6. To calculate the amount she will save, we take 10% of her total earnings, which is 0.10 * $290 = $29.

Answer: $29.
