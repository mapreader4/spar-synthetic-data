Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, Nala found 5 seashells.
* On the second day, Nala found 7 seashells.
* On the third day, Nala found twice the number of seashells she found on the first two days.
* The number of seashells she found on the first two days is 5 + 7 = 12.
* Twice the number of seashells she found on the first two days is 2 * 12 = 24.
* So on the third day, Nala found 24 seashells.
* In total, Nala found 5 + 7 + 24 = 36 seashells.
