Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kimiko watches 4 YouTube videos in total
* The first video is 2 minutes long, which is 2 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 120 seconds
* The second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds long, which is 4 minutes x 60 seconds/minute + 30 seconds = 270 seconds
* The last two videos are equal in length
* The total time spent watching YouTube is 510 seconds

Now, let's calculate the total time of the first two videos:
* 120 seconds + 270 seconds = 390 seconds

The remaining time is the total time spent watching YouTube minus the time spent watching the first two videos:
* 510 seconds - 390 seconds = 120 seconds

Since the last two videos are equal in length, we can divide the remaining time by 2 to get the length of each of the last two videos:
* 120 seconds / 2 = 60 seconds

Answer: 60 seconds
