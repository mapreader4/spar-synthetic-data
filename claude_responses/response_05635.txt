Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Ray has 100 customers waiting at his fish market
* He has 10 tuna, each weighing 200 pounds
* Each customer wants 25 pounds of tuna
* The store is first come, first served

First, we need to calculate the total amount of tuna available:
* 10 tuna x 200 pounds per tuna = 2,000 pounds of tuna

Next, we need to calculate how many customers can be served with the available tuna:
* 2,000 pounds of tuna / 25 pounds per customer = 80 customers

Finally, we can calculate how many customers will go home without any fish:
* 100 customers - 80 customers served = 20 customers will go home without any fish

Answer: 20
