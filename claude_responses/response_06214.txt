Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first plane has 50 passengers, so its speed would be 600 MPH - (50 * 2 MPH) = 500 MPH
* The second plane has 60 passengers, so its speed would be 600 MPH - (60 * 2 MPH) = 480 MPH
* The third plane has 40 passengers, so its speed would be 600 MPH - (40 * 2 MPH) = 520 MPH
* To calculate the average speed, we add the speeds of the three planes and divide by 3:
* (500 MPH + 480 MPH + 520 MPH) / 3 = 500 MPH

Answer: 500 MPH
