Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On Saturday:
* Scout worked 4 hours
* His base pay is $10.00 per hour
* He delivered groceries to 5 people
* He earned $5.00 per customer
* So, his Saturday earnings are:
    - Base pay: 4 hours x $10.00 per hour = $40.00
    - Tips: 5 customers x $5.00 per customer = $25.00
    - Total Saturday earnings: $40.00 + $25.00 = $65.00

On Sunday:
* Scout worked 5 hours
* His base pay is $10.00 per hour
* He delivered groceries to 8 people
* He earned $5.00 per customer
* So, his Sunday earnings are:
    - Base pay: 5 hours x $10.00 per hour = $50.00
    - Tips: 8 customers x $5.00 per customer = $40.00
    - Total Sunday earnings: $50.00 + $40.00 = $90.00

Now, to calculate his total earnings over the weekend:
* Total earnings = Saturday earnings + Sunday earnings
* Total earnings = $65.00 + $90.00 = $155.00

Answer: $155
