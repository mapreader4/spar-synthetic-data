Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The central area of the bathroom is 10 feet by 10 feet.
   * The area of the central area is 10 feet x 10 feet = 100 square feet.

2) The hallway area of the bathroom is 6 feet by 4 feet.
   * The area of the hallway is 6 feet x 4 feet = 24 square feet.

3) To find the total area of hardwood flooring installed, we add the areas of the central area and the hallway:
   * Total area = 100 square feet + 24 square feet = 124 square feet.

Answer: 124 square feet.
