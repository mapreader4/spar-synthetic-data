Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Paul made two bank transfers:
   - The first transfer was $90.
   - The second transfer was $60.

2. A service charge of 2% was added to each transaction.
   - For the first transfer of $90, the service charge would be 2% of $90, which is $1.80.
   - For the second transfer of $60, the service charge would be 2% of $60, which is $1.20.

3. The second transaction was reversed (without the service charge).
   - This means the $60 transfer was canceled, and the $1.20 service charge was not applied.

4. Paul's account balance before the transfers was $400.
   - The first transfer of $90 with a $1.80 service charge would leave $400 - $90 - $1.80 = $308.20 in his account.
   - The second transfer of $60 with a $1.20 service charge would leave $308.20 - $60 - $1.20 = $247 in his account.
   - Since the second transaction was reversed, his final account balance would be $247 + $60 = $307.
