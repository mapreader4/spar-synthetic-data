Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenna's doctor says she should tan no more than 200 minutes a month.
* Jenna tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week for the first two weeks of the month.
* To calculate the total minutes she has tanned in the first two weeks:
  - 2 days per week x 2 weeks = 4 days
  - 4 days x 30 minutes per day = 120 minutes
* Now, we need to calculate how many minutes she can tan in the last two weeks of the month:
  - Total allowed minutes per month = 200 minutes
  - Minutes tanned in the first two weeks = 120 minutes
  - Remaining minutes she can tan in the last two weeks = 200 minutes - 120 minutes = 80 minutes

Answer: 80 minutes
