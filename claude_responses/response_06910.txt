Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John can make 20 widgets per hour
* He works for 8 hours a day
* He works 5 days a week
* To calculate the number of widgets he makes per day, we multiply the number of widgets per hour (20) by the number of hours he works per day (8):
20 widgets/hour x 8 hours/day = 160 widgets/day
* To calculate the number of widgets he makes per week, we multiply the number of widgets per day (160) by the number of days he works per week (5):
160 widgets/day x 5 days/week = 800 widgets/week

Answer: 800
