Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Diego baked 12 cakes for his sister's birthday.
2) Donald baked 4 cakes.
3) Donald ate 1 of the cakes he baked while waiting for the party to start.
4) So, the number of cakes Donald has left is 4 - 1 = 3 cakes.
5) The total number of cakes left is the sum of the cakes baked by Diego (12) and the cakes left by Donald (3).
6) 12 + 3 = 15 cakes left.
