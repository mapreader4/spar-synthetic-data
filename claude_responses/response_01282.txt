Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Karen's box contained 128 crayons
* Karen's box contained twice as many crayons as Beatrice's box
* So Beatrice's box contained 128 / 2 = 64 crayons
* Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as Gilbert's box
* So Gilbert's box contained 64 / 2 = 32 crayons
* Gilbert's box contained four times as many crayons as Judah's box
* So Judah's box contained 32 / 4 = 8 crayons
