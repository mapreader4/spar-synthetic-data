Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lyn donates $240 to the private organization each year.
2) 1/3 of the $240 goes to the community pantry project. That's 1/3 * $240 = $80.
3) 1/2 of the $240 goes to the local crisis fund. That's 1/2 * $240 = $120.
4) The remaining amount after the community pantry project and local crisis fund is $240 - $80 - $120 = $40.
5) 1/4 of the remaining $40 goes to the livelihood project funds. That's 1/4 * $40 = $10.
6) The rest of the $40 goes to the contingency fund. That's $40 - $10 = $30.

Answer: $30
