Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John reads his bible for 2 hours a day
* He reads at a rate of 50 pages per hour
* The bible is 2800 pages long

To calculate how many pages John can read in a day:
* 2 hours per day x 50 pages per hour = 100 pages per day

Now, to calculate how many days it will take him to read the entire 2800 page bible:
* 2800 pages / 100 pages per day = 28 days

Finally, to convert this to weeks:
* 28 days / 7 days per week = 4 weeks

Answer: 4 weeks
