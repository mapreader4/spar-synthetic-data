Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Toby can pull the unloaded sled at a speed of 20 miles per hour.
2) Toby can pull the fully loaded sled at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
3) The journey is in 4 parts:
   a) Pulling the loaded sled for 180 miles
   b) Pulling the unloaded sled for 120 miles
   c) Pulling the loaded sled for 80 miles
   d) Pulling the unloaded sled for 140 miles
4) To calculate the time for each part:
   a) Pulling the loaded sled for 180 miles at 10 miles per hour: 180 / 10 = 18 hours
   b) Pulling the unloaded sled for 120 miles at 20 miles per hour: 120 / 20 = 6 hours
   c) Pulling the loaded sled for 80 miles at 10 miles per hour: 80 / 10 = 8 hours
   d) Pulling the unloaded sled for 140 miles at 20 miles per hour: 140 / 20 = 7 hours
5) Adding up the times for each part:
   18 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours + 7 hours = 39 hours

Answer: 39 hours
