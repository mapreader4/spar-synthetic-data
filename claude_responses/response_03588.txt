Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The number of bedbugs triples each day
* After 4 days, there were 810 bedbugs
* Let's call the initial number of bedbugs x
* After 1 day, the number of bedbugs would be 3x
* After 2 days, the number of bedbugs would be 3 * 3x = 9x
* After 3 days, the number of bedbugs would be 3 * 9x = 27x
* After 4 days, the number of bedbugs would be 3 * 27x = 81x
* We know that after 4 days, there were 810 bedbugs, so 81x = 810
* Solving for x, we get x = 10
* Therefore, the group started with 10 bedbugs.

Answer: 10
