Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) A tiger shark has 180 teeth.
2) A hammerhead shark has 1/6 the number of teeth that a tiger shark has. To find the number of teeth for the hammerhead shark, we take 1/6 of 180, which is 30 teeth.
3) A great white shark has double the sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark. 
4) The sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark is 180 + 30 = 210.
5) Double the sum of 210 is 420.

Answer: 420
