Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ariana bought a bunch of 40 flowers
* 2/5 of the flowers were roses
* To find the number of roses, we take 2/5 of 40:
  * 2/5 * 40 = 80/5 = 16 roses
* She also bought 10 tulips
* The rest of the flowers were carnations
* To find the number of carnations, we need to subtract the number of roses and tulips from the total number of flowers:
  * Total flowers = 40
  * Roses = 16
  * Tulips = 10
  * Carnations = 40 - 16 - 10 = 14

Answer: 14 carnations.
