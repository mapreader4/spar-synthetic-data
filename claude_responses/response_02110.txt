Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Julia bought 2 pieces of Snickers, and each piece of Snickers costs $1.5.
2) The total cost of the Snickers is 2 * $1.5 = $3.
3) Julia also bought 3 packs of M&M's, and each pack of M&M's has the same cost as 2 Snickers.
4) Since each Snickers costs $1.5, each pack of M&M's costs 2 * $1.5 = $3.
5) The total cost of the 3 packs of M&M's is 3 * $3 = $9.
6) The total cost of Julia's purchase is $3 + $9 = $12.
7) Julia gave the cashier 2 $10 bills, which is a total of $20.
8) The change Julia should receive is $20 - $12 = $8.
