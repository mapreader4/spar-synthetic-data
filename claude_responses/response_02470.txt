Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, Brenda was ahead by 22 points.
2) Brenda then made a 15-point play, which means her lead increased by 15 points.
3) So, after Brenda's 15-point play, she was ahead by 22 + 15 = 37 points.
4) David then made a 32-point play, which means Brenda's lead decreased by 32 points.
5) Therefore, Brenda is now ahead by 37 - 32 = 5 points.
