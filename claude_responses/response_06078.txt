Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, Cyrus wrote 25 pages
* On the second day, he wrote twice the amount he did on the first day, which is 2 * 25 = 50 pages
* On the third day, he wrote twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 * 50 = 100 pages
* On the fourth day, he wrote 10 pages

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he has written so far:
* Total pages written = 25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages

The book needs to be 500 pages, so we can calculate the number of pages he still needs to write:
* Pages remaining = 500 - 185 = 315 pages

Answer: 315
