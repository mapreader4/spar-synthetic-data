Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's former rent was $2 per square foot for a 750 square foot apartment.
   * Former rent = $2 per square foot x 750 square feet = $1,500 per month

2. John's new apartment costs $2,800 per month, which he splits evenly with his roommate.
   * John's share of the new rent = $2,800 / 2 = $1,400 per month

3. To calculate the money John saves per year:
   * Former rent per year = $1,500 x 12 months = $18,000
   * New rent per year = $1,400 x 12 months = $16,800
   * Money saved per year = $18,000 - $16,800 = $1,200

Answer: $1,200
