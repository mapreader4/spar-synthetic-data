Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Karen baked 50 chocolate chip cookies
* She kept 10 for herself
* She gave 8 to her grandparents
* So, the total number of cookies she has left is 50 - 10 - 8 = 32 cookies
* She wants to give cookies to everyone in her class, and there are 16 people in her class
* To find how many cookies each person will receive, we need to divide the total number of cookies (32) by the number of people in the class (16)
* 32 รท 16 = 2
