Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Let's say your current age is x.
* Six years ago, your age was x - 6.
* The problem states that you are three times older than you were six years ago.
* So, your current age (x) is three times your age six years ago (x - 6).
* We can write this as an equation: x = 3(x - 6)
* Solving for x:
* x = 3x - 18
* -2x = -18
* x = 9
* Therefore, your current age is 9 years old.

Answer: 9
