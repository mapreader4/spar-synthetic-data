Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kiarra is twice as old as Bea, so if Kiarra is 30, then Bea is 15 years old.
* Job is 3 times older than Bea, so Job is 45 years old.
* Figaro is 7 years older than Job, so Figaro is 52 years old.
* Harry is half as old as Figaro, so Harry is 26 years old.
