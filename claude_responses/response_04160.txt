Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hannah harvests 5 strawberries daily for the next whole month of April, which has 30 days.
2) To calculate the total number of strawberries harvested, we multiply the daily harvest (5) by the number of days in April (30):
5 strawberries/day x 30 days = 150 strawberries harvested
3) Hannah gives away 20 strawberries to her friends.
4) 30 strawberries are stolen.
5) To calculate the number of strawberries Hannah has by the end of April, we take the total harvested (150) and subtract the number given away (20) and the number stolen (30):
150 strawberries - 20 strawberries - 30 strawberries = 100 strawberries

Answer: 100
