Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Heather gets paid 5 cents for every weed she picks
* She wants to earn $10 an hour
* To find the average time it takes her to pick a weed, we need to find how many weeds she needs to pick per hour to earn $10

First, let's find how many weeds she needs to pick per hour to earn $10:
* $10 per hour / 5 cents per weed = 200 weeds per hour

Now, to find the average time it takes her to pick a weed, we divide the number of seconds in an hour by the number of weeds she needs to pick per hour:
* 3600 seconds per hour / 200 weeds per hour = 18 seconds per weed

Answer: 18 seconds
