Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* As a child, Bobby could jump rope 30 times per minute
* As an adult, Bobby can jump 1 jump per second
* To convert the adult jumps to jumps per minute, we need to multiply 1 jump per second by 60 seconds per minute
* 1 jump per second x 60 seconds per minute = 60 jumps per minute
* The difference between the adult jumps per minute (60) and the child jumps per minute (30) is:
* 60 jumps per minute - 30 jumps per minute = 30 more jumps per minute

Answer: 30
