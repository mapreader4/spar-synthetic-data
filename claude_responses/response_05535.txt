Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 13 3-year-olds and 20 4-year-olds. Together, there are 13 + 20 = 33 children in the 3 and 4-year-old class.
2) There are 15 5-year-olds and 22 6-year-olds. Together, there are 15 + 22 = 37 children in the 5 and 6-year-old class.
3) To find the average class size, we need to add the number of children in each class and divide by the number of classes.
4) The total number of children is 33 + 37 = 70.
5) There are 2 classes, so the average class size is 70 / 2 = 35.

Answer: 35
