Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Phil won a total of 12 games
* Phil won 3 games more than Charlie did
* So, if Phil won 12 games, and he won 3 more than Charlie, then Charlie must have won 12 - 3 = 9 games
* Charlie won 2 games fewer than Dana
* So, if Charlie won 9 games, and he won 2 fewer than Dana, then Dana must have won 9 + 2 = 11 games
* Perry won 5 more games than Dana
* So, if Dana won 11 games, and Perry won 5 more, then Perry must have won 11 + 5 = 16 games

Answer: Perry won 4 more games than Phil.
