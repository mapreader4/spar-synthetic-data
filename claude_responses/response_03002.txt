Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brenda needs to make 3 trays of banana pudding.
2) Each tray requires 80 wafer cookies.
3) So, the total number of wafer cookies needed for 3 trays is 3 * 80 = 240 cookies.
4) Each box of wafer cookies contains 60 cookies.
5) To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total cookies required (240) by the number of cookies per box (60): 240 / 60 = 4 boxes.
6) Each box costs $3.50.
7) Therefore, the total cost to buy 4 boxes of wafer cookies will be 4 * $3.50 = $14.
