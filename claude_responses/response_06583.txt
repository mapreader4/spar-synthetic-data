Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack bought a squat rack for $2500
* The barbell cost 1/10 as much as the squat rack
* To find the cost of the barbell, we take the cost of the squat rack ($2500) and divide it by 10
* $2500 / 10 = $250
* So the barbell cost $250
* To find the total amount Jack paid, we add the cost of the squat rack ($2500) and the cost of the barbell ($250)
* $2500 + $250 = $2750

Answer: $2750
