Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each customer needs 1 can of hairspray during the styling
* Each customer is also given 1 can of hairspray to take home
* So, each customer uses 2 cans of hairspray in total
* The salon also buys an extra 5 cans of hairspray each day to ensure there is never a shortage
* The salon buys 33 cans of hairspray every day
* To find the number of customers, we need to subtract the extra 5 cans from the total 33 cans, and then divide the remaining 28 cans by 2 (since each customer uses 2 cans)

Therefore, the number of customers the salon has each day is:
Answer: 14
