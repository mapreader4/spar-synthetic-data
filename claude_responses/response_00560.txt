Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The local bookstore donated 48 boxes of erasers.
2) There are 24 erasers in each box.
3) To find the total number of erasers, we multiply the number of boxes (48) by the number of erasers per box (24):
   48 boxes x 24 erasers/box = 1,152 erasers
4) The student council sells the erasers for $0.75 each.
5) To find the total amount of money the student council will make, we multiply the total number of erasers (1,152) by the selling price per eraser ($0.75):
   1,152 erasers x $0.75/eraser = $864

Answer: $864
