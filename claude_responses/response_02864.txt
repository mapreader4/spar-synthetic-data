Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Trey has 7 times as many turtles as Kris.
2) Kris has 1/4 as many turtles as Kristen.
3) Kristen has 12 turtles.
4) So Kris has 1/4 of 12 turtles, which is 3 turtles.
5) Trey has 7 times as many turtles as Kris, so Trey has 7 x 3 = 21 turtles.
6) Kristen has 12 turtles, so Trey has 21 - 12 = 9 more turtles than Kristen.
