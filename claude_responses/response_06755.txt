Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexander draws 9 pictures for the first exhibition
* He then draws pictures for 5 new galleries
* Each of the 5 new galleries receives the same amount of pictures
* For each picture, Alexander needs 4 pencils
* For each exhibition, he needs another 2 pencils for signing his signature on the pictures
* In total, Alexander uses 88 pencils on drawing and signing his pictures for all of the exhibitions

First, let's calculate the total number of pictures drawn:
* 9 pictures for the first exhibition
* Plus the 5 new galleries, each receiving the same amount of pictures
* So the total number of pictures is 9 + 5x, where x is the number of pictures per new gallery

Next, let's calculate the total number of pencils used:
* 4 pencils per picture
* Plus 2 pencils per exhibition
* So the total number of pencils used is 4(9 + 5x) + 2(9 + 5) = 36 + 20x + 18 = 54 + 20x

We know that the total number of pencils used is 88, so we can set up an equation:
* 54 + 20x = 88
* Solving for x, we get x = 1.7

Since we cannot have a fractional number of paintings per gallery, the answer must be an integer. Rounding down, the number of paintings at each of the 5 new galleries is 1.
