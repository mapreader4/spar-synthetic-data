Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ivanka's book took 3 more months than Woody's book
* Woody spent 1.5 years writing his book
* 1.5 years = 18 months

Since Ivanka's book took 3 more months than Woody's, we can calculate the time it took Ivanka to write her book:
* Ivanka's book = Woody's book + 3 months
* Ivanka's book = 18 months + 3 months = 21 months

Now, to find the total time it took Ivanka and Woody to write their books, we add the time for each:
* Total time = Ivanka's book + Woody's book
* Total time = 21 months + 18 months = 39 months

Answer: 39 months
