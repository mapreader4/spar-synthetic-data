Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Seal releases 3 songs every month
* He gets $2000 per song
* We need to calculate his earnings in the first 3 years

First, let's calculate his monthly earnings:
* 3 songs per month x $2000 per song = $6000 per month

Now, let's calculate his yearly earnings:
* $6000 per month x 12 months = $72,000 per year

Finally, let's calculate his earnings in the first 3 years:
* $72,000 per year x 3 years = $216,000

Answer: $216,000
