Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nick is selling candy bars for $5 each
* He is also selling chocolate oranges for $10 each
* He wants to raise $1000 in total
* He sold out of the 20 chocolate oranges he had, which means he made $200 from the chocolate oranges (20 x $10)
* To reach his goal of $1000, he needs to make an additional $800 from selling candy bars
* Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining $800 by $5 to determine how many candy bars he needs to sell
* $800 / $5 = 160 candy bars

Answer: 160
