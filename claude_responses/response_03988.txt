Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Moksi took DJ Snake and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights at $4000 per night
* So the cost of the hotel stay was 2 nights x $4000 per night = $8000
* Lil Jon bought them a car worth $30,000
* Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them
* The value of the house is 4 x $30,000 = $120,000

Now, to calculate the total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day:
* Total value = Cost of hotel stay + Value of car + Value of house
* Total value = $8,000 + $30,000 + $120,000
* Answer: $158,000
