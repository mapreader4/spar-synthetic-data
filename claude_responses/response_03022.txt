Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tommy's home is worth 25% more than he bought it for
* This means the selling price of the home is 125% of the original purchase price
* He sells this home and buys a new house that costs $500,000
* He can only pay 75% of the new house, so he needs to take a loan for the remaining 25%

To find the original purchase price of the first house, we can use the following equation:
* Let x = original purchase price of the first house
* Selling price of the first house = 1.25x (since it's worth 25% more)
* New house price = $500,000
* Loan amount = 25% of $500,000 = 0.25 * $500,000 = $125,000

Since the selling price of the first house is equal to the loan amount for the new house, we can set up the equation:
* 1.25x = $125,000
* x = $125,000 / 1.25
* x = $100,000

Therefore, Tommy bought his first house for $100,000.
