Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Madeline has $48.
2) Her brother has half as much as Madeline.
3) To find how much her brother has, we take Madeline's amount ($48) and divide it by 2.
4) $48 / 2 = $24
5) So Madeline's brother has $24.
6) To find the total amount they have together, we add Madeline's $48 and her brother's $24.
7) $48 + $24 = $72.

Answer: 72
