Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The tree is initially 1 year old and 5 feet tall.
* The tree gains 3 feet per year.
* We want to find the age of the tree when it is 23 feet tall.
* To find the age, we need to determine how many years it takes for the tree to grow from 5 feet to 23 feet.
* The tree gains 3 feet per year, so we can calculate the number of years it takes to grow 18 feet (23 feet - 5 feet).
* 18 feet / 3 feet per year = 6 years
* Since the tree was initially 1 year old, we add 6 years to get the final age of the tree.
* 1 year + 6 years = 7 years
