Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Teresa scored 70 marks in science
* Teresa scored 80 marks in music
* Teresa scored 85 marks in social studies
* Teresa scored half as many marks in physics as she did in music
* To find the marks in physics, we take half of the marks in music:
    - Marks in music = 80
    - Marks in physics = 80 / 2 = 40

Now, we can calculate the total marks Teresa scored in all the subjects:
* Total marks = Marks in science + Marks in music + Marks in social studies + Marks in physics
* Total marks = 70 + 80 + 85 + 40
* Total marks = 275

Answer: 275
