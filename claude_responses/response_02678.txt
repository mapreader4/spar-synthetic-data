Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nunzio eats 3 pieces of pizza every day for lunch
* Each piece of pizza represents 1/8 of the entire pie
* We need to find how many pizzas Nunzio eats in 72 days

First, let's calculate how many pieces of pizza Nunzio eats in 72 days:
* 3 pieces per day x 72 days = 216 pieces of pizza

Now, we need to convert the number of pieces to the number of pizzas. Since each piece represents 1/8 of a pizza, we can divide the total number of pieces by 8 to get the number of pizzas:
* 216 pieces / 8 pieces per pizza = 27 pizzas

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 27
