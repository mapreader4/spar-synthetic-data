Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ali starts with:
- 23 kg of kidney apples
- 37 kg of golden apples
- 14 kg of Canada apples
2) The total mass of apples he starts with is:
23 kg + 37 kg + 14 kg = 74 kg
3) By noon, 36 kg of apples were sold.
4) To find the mass of apples he has left, we subtract the 36 kg that were sold from the total 74 kg he started with.
74 kg - 36 kg = 38 kg

Answer: 38
