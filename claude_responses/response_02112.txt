Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kona drives 9 miles from his apartment to the bakery.
2. From the bakery, he drives 24 miles to his grandmother's house.
3. From his grandmother's house, he drives 27 miles straight back to his apartment.

Now, let's calculate the total distance he drove with the bakery stop:
* Apartment to Bakery: 9 miles
* Bakery to Grandmother's House: 24 miles
* Grandmother's House to Apartment: 27 miles
* Total distance with bakery stop: 9 + 24 + 27 = 60 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance he would have driven without the bakery stop:
* Apartment to Grandmother's House: 27 miles
* Grandmother's House to Apartment: 27 miles
* Total distance without bakery stop: 27 + 27 = 54 miles

To find the additional miles Kona drove with the bakery stop, we subtract the distance without the bakery stop from the distance with the bakery stop:
* Additional miles with bakery stop: 60 - 54 = 6 miles

Answer: 6 miles
