Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Daytona Beach has 26 shark sightings a year.
2) Daytona Beach has 5 more than triple the number of shark sightings as Cape May.
3) Let's represent the number of shark sightings in Cape May as x.
4) Daytona Beach has 3x shark sightings, plus an additional 5.
5) So, 26 = 3x + 5
6) Solving for x, we get:
26 - 5 = 3x
21 = 3x
x = 7
