Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janice works 5 days a week at the convenience store
* She earns $30 per day
* So for the 5 regular days, she earns:
  * 5 days x $30 per day = $150
* She also works 3 overtime shifts this week
* Each overtime shift is 2 hours long, and she earns $15 more for each overtime shift
* So for the 3 overtime shifts, she earns:
  * 3 shifts x $15 per shift = $45
* To calculate her total earnings for the week, we add the earnings from the regular days and the overtime shifts:
  * $150 + $45 = $195

Answer: $195
