Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ivan had $10 to start with.
2) He spent 1/5 of $10 on cupcakes. 1/5 of $10 is $2, so he spent $2 on cupcakes.
3) After buying the cupcakes, he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.
4) He then spent some money on a milkshake and had only $3 left.
5) To find the cost of the milkshake, we need to subtract the $3 he had left from the $8 he had after buying the cupcakes.
6) $8 - $3 = $5
Therefore, the cost of the milkshake is $5.
