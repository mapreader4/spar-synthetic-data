Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In 2014, Kendra made $8000 less than Laurel made in sales.
   * Laurel earned $30000 in 2014.
   * Therefore, Kendra earned $30000 - $8000 = $22000 in 2014.

2. In 2015, Kendra made 20% more money than Laurel made in 2014.
   * Laurel earned $30000 in 2014.
   * 20% of $30000 is $6000.
   * Therefore, Kendra earned $30000 + $6000 = $36000 in 2015.

3. To calculate Kendra's total earnings in the two years:
   * Kendra earned $22000 in 2014.
   * Kendra earned $36000 in 2015.
   * Kendra's total earnings in the two years is $22000 + $36000 = $58000.

Answer: 58000
