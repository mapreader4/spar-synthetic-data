Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry needs to add 1 black-and-white cartridge and 3 color cartridges to get the printer to work
* Each color cartridge costs $32
* Each black-and-white cartridge costs $27

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the 3 color cartridges
   * 3 color cartridges x $32 per cartridge = $96
2. Calculate the cost of the 1 black-and-white cartridge
   * 1 black-and-white cartridge x $27 per cartridge = $27
3. Add the cost of the color cartridges and the black-and-white cartridge
   * $96 + $27 = $123

Answer: $123
