Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry works 5 days a week
* The past 4 nights, he earned $20, $60, $15, and $40 in tips
* He wants to make an average of $50 in tips per night

To calculate the total amount of tips he has earned so far, we add up the tips from the past 4 nights:
* $20 + $60 + $15 + $40 = $135

Now, to find the average tips per night, we divide the total tips by the number of nights:
* $135 / 4 = $33.75

So, the average tips per night so far is $33.75.

To find the amount he needs to earn tonight to make an average of $50 per night, we can use the following formula:
* (Total tips so far + Tips needed tonight) / 5 nights = $50 per night
* ($135 + Tips needed tonight) / 5 = $50
* Tips needed tonight = $50 * 5 - $135
* Tips needed tonight = $250 - $135
* Tips needed tonight = $115

Answer: $115
