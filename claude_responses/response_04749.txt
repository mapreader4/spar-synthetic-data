Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Saturday, Lassie ate half of her bones.
* On Sunday, she received 10 more bones.
* She now has a total of 35 bones.

Let's start by finding out how many bones she had after eating half of them on Saturday.
* If she ate half of her bones on Saturday, then the remaining bones would be half of the original amount.
* Let's call the original amount of bones "x".
* After eating half on Saturday, she would have x/2 bones.

Now, on Sunday she received 10 more bones, so the total number of bones she has is:
* x/2 + 10 = 35

Solving for x:
* x/2 + 10 = 35
* x/2 = 25
* x = 50

Therefore, Lassie started with 50 bones before eating them on Saturday.

Answer: 50
