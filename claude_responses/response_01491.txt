Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr Julien's store had 400 marbles remaining after the previous day's sales.
2) 20 customers came into the store, and each bought 15 marbles.
3) To calculate the total number of marbles sold, we multiply the number of customers (20) by the number of marbles each customer bought (15):
20 customers x 15 marbles per customer = 300 marbles sold
4) To calculate the number of marbles remaining in the store, we take the initial number of marbles (400) and subtract the number of marbles sold (300):
400 marbles - 300 marbles sold = 100 marbles remaining

Answer: 100
