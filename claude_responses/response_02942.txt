Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gunther's monthly payment is $150.00
* The loan term is 5 years
* There is no interest charged

To find the total amount Gunther financed, we need to calculate the total of all his monthly payments over the 5-year period.

* 5 years = 60 months (5 years x 12 months per year = 60 months)
* Monthly payment = $150.00
* Total payments = $150.00 x 60 months = $9,000.00

Therefore, the amount Gunther financed for the John Deere tractor is:

Answer: $9,000
