Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Last week, the farmer shipped 10 boxes of pomelos
* In total, there were 240 pomelos in those 10 boxes
* This week, the farmer shipped 20 boxes
* We need to find the total number of pomelos shipped in all
* To do this, we can assume that the number of pomelos per box is the same for both weeks
* Last week, there were 240 pomelos in 10 boxes, so that's 24 pomelos per box
* This week, with 20 boxes, the total number of pomelos would be 20 * 24 = 480 pomelos
* The total number of pomelos shipped in all is 240 + 480 = 720 pomelos
* There are 12 pomelos in a dozen
* So the total number of dozens of pomelos shipped is 720 / 12 = 60 dozens

Answer: 60
