Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Isabel runs a circuit that is 365 meters long
* In the morning, she runs the circuit 7 times
* So in the morning, she runs 7 * 365 = 2,555 meters
* In the afternoon, she runs the circuit 3 times
* So in the afternoon, she runs 3 * 365 = 1,095 meters
* To find the total distance she runs in a week, we add the morning and afternoon distances:
* 2,555 meters + 1,095 meters = 3,650 meters

Answer: 3,650
