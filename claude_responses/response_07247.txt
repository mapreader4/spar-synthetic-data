Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total attendance for the 3-day festival was 2700 people
* The first day had an unknown number of attendees, let's call this x
* The second day had half the number of attendees as the first day, so the attendance was x/2
* The third day had triple the number of attendees as the first day, so the attendance was 3x

We can set up an equation to solve for the attendance on the second day:
* Total attendance = x + x/2 + 3x
* 2700 = 4.5x
* x = 600

Therefore, the attendance on the second day was x/2 = 600/2 = 300 people.

Answer: 300
