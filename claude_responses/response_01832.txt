Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Reynald bought a total of 145 balls
* 20 of them were soccer balls
* There were 5 more basketballs than soccer balls, so there were 20 + 5 = 25 basketballs
* Twice the number of soccer balls were tennis balls, so there were 2 * 20 = 40 tennis balls
* There were 10 more baseballs than soccer balls, so there were 20 + 10 = 30 baseballs
* The remaining balls must have been volleyballs

To calculate the number of volleyballs, we take the total number of balls (145) and subtract the number of each type of ball:
* Soccer balls: 20
* Basketballs: 25
* Tennis balls: 40
* Baseballs: 30

145 - 20 - 25 - 40 - 30 = 30 volleyballs

Answer: 30
