Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Zion is 8 years old.
2) Zion's dad's age is 3 more than 4 times Zion's age.
   * Zion's age is 8 years.
   * 4 times 8 is 32.
   * 32 plus 3 is 35.
   * So Zion's dad is 35 years old.
3) In 10 years, Zion will be 18 years old.
   * Zion's dad will be 45 years old.
4) The difference between Zion's dad's age and Zion's age in 10 years is 45 - 18 = 27 years.

Answer: 27
