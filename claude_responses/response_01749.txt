Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John chops down 30 trees.
2) From each tree, he can make 25 planks.
3) So the total number of planks he can make is 30 trees x 25 planks per tree = 750 planks.
4) A table takes 15 planks to make.
5) So the number of tables he can make with 750 planks is 750 planks / 15 planks per table = 50 tables.
6) Each table sells for $300.
7) So the total revenue from selling 50 tables is 50 tables x $300 per table = $15,000.
8) John paid $3,000 for the labor.
9) Therefore, the profit he made is the total revenue ($15,000) minus the labor cost ($3,000), which is $15,000 - $3,000 = $12,000.

Answer: $12,000
