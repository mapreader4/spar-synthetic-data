Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie. This means that if Bobbie has x crayons, then Lizzie has x/2 crayons.
2) Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie. This means that if Billie has 18 crayons, then Bobbie has 3 * 18 = 54 crayons.
3) Since Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie, and Bobbie has 54 crayons, then Lizzie has 54/2 = 27 crayons.

Answer: 27
