Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total area of the garden is 220 feet x 120 feet = 26,400 square feet.
2) Half of the garden will be tilled land, so the tilled land area is 26,400 / 2 = 13,200 square feet.
3) The remaining area is 26,400 - 13,200 = 13,200 square feet.
4) One-third of the remaining area will have trellises, so the trellis area is 13,200 / 3 = 4,400 square feet.
5) The remaining area will be devoted to raised beds, which is 13,200 - 4,400 = 8,800 square feet.

Answer: 8,800 square feet
