Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue. This means that the number of dark blue marbles is at least 63 / 3 = 21.
2) We also know that all of the rest of the marbles are red, except for 4 that are green.
3) The total number of marbles is 63.
4) We can subtract the number of dark blue marbles (at least 21) and the number of green marbles (4) from the total number of marbles (63) to get the number of red marbles.
5) 63 - 21 - 4 = 38
Answer: 38
