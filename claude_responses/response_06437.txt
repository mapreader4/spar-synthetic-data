Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each battery takes 6 minutes to gather the materials and 9 minutes to create the battery
* So the total time to make one battery is 6 + 9 = 15 minutes
* The factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time
* In 5 hours, there are 5 x 60 = 300 minutes
* Each robot can make 1 battery every 15 minutes
* So in 300 minutes, each robot can make 300 / 15 = 20 batteries
* With 10 robots, the total number of batteries made in 5 hours is 10 x 20 = 200 batteries

Answer: 200 batteries
