Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yulia's total profit this week was $44
* Her lemonade stand made a gross revenue of $47
* She also made $31 from babysitting
* To find the amount she spent to operate her lemonade stand, we can use the following equation:
Profit = Gross Revenue - Expenses
* We know the Profit is $44 and the Gross Revenue is $47
* So we can rearrange the equation to solve for Expenses:
Expenses = Gross Revenue - Profit
* Plugging in the values we have:
Expenses = $47 - $44 = $3

Answer: $3
