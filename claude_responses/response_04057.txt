Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Violet has 3 more than twice as many nails as Tickletoe.
2) This means that Violet's number of nails is equal to (2 x Tickletoe's nails) + 3.
3) We know that Violet has 27 nails, so we can set up the equation:
27 = (2 x Tickletoe's nails) + 3
4) Solving for Tickletoe's nails, we get:
27 - 3 = 2 x Tickletoe's nails
24 = 2 x Tickletoe's nails
Tickletoe's nails = 12
5) Now that we know Tickletoe has 12 nails, we can add Violet's 27 nails to get the total number of nails they have together.
