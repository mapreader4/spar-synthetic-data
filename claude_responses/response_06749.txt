Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.
2) He buys 20 toy cars.
3) Since he buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, the number of toy soldiers he buys is 2 * 20 = 40.
4) The total number of toys he buys is the sum of the toy cars and toy soldiers: 20 + 40 = 60.

Answer: 60
