Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sophie buys 5 cupcakes at $2 each, so the total cost of the cupcakes is 5 * $2 = $10.
2) Sophie buys 6 doughnuts at $1 each, so the total cost of the doughnuts is 6 * $1 = $6.
3) Sophie buys 4 slices of apple pie at $2 per slice, so the total cost of the apple pie is 4 * $2 = $8.
4) Sophie buys 15 cookies at $0.60 each, so the total cost of the cookies is 15 * $0.60 = $9.
5) To find the total amount Sophie spends, we add up the costs of the cupcakes, doughnuts, apple pie, and cookies:
$10 + $6 + $8 + $9 = $33.
