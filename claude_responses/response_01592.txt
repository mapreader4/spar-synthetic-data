Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Betty has 20 books
* Betty's sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty
* To find the number of books Betty's sister has, we take Betty's 20 books and multiply it by 1/4:
* 20 books x 1/4 = 5 books
* So Betty's sister has 5 more books than Betty
* To find the total number of books the two have, we add Betty's 20 books and her sister's 5 books:
* 20 books + 5 books = 25 books

Answer: 25
