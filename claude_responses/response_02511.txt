Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James is charged with 2 counts of arson, each carrying a 6-year sentence
* So the total arson sentence is 2 * 6 = 12 years
* The explosives charge has a sentence that is twice as long as the total arson sentence
* The total arson sentence is 12 years, so the explosives charge sentence is 2 * 12 = 24 years
* The domestic terrorism charge carries a 20-year sentence
* To calculate the total sentence, we add up the sentences for each charge:
* Arson: 12 years
* Explosives: 24 years
* Domestic Terrorism: 20 years
* Total sentence = 12 + 24 + 20 = 56 years

Answer: 56 years
