Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Andrew worked 300 days last year
* For every 10 days worked, he gets 1 vacation day
* So, for 300 days worked, he should have earned 30 vacation days (300 / 10 = 30)
* However, he took 5 days off in March and twice as many in September, which is 10 days (5 x 2 = 10)
* So, the number of vacation days he has taken so far is 10
* To calculate the number of vacation days he can still take, we take the total vacation days he has earned (30) and subtract the number he has taken (10)
* 30 - 10 = 20

Answer: 20
