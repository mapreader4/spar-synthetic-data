Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Albert has three times as many marbles as Angela.
2) Angela has 8 more than Allison.
3) Allison has 28 marbles.
4) So, Angela has 28 + 8 = 36 marbles.
5) Since Albert has three times as many marbles as Angela, Albert has 3 * 36 = 108 marbles.
6) Allison has 28 marbles.

Answer: 108 + 28 = 136 marbles.
