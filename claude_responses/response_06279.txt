Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael charges $22 for each large birdhouse
* He sold 2 large birdhouses this week
* So for the large birdhouses, he made: 2 x $22 = $44

* Michael charges $16 for each medium birdhouse
* He sold 2 medium birdhouses this week
* So for the medium birdhouses, he made: 2 x $16 = $32

* Michael charges $7 for each small birdhouse
* He sold 3 small birdhouses this week
* So for the small birdhouses, he made: 3 x $7 = $21

Now, to calculate the total amount of money he made this week, we add up the amounts from the large, medium, and small birdhouses:
$44 + $32 + $21 = $97

Answer: $97
