Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Abby is building 2 raised beds.
2) Each bed is 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 1 foot high.
3) To calculate the volume of each bed, we multiply the length, width, and height:
   * Volume of each bed = 8 feet x 4 feet x 1 foot = 32 cubic feet
4) Since there are 2 beds, the total volume needed is:
   * Total volume = 2 x 32 cubic feet = 64 cubic feet
5) Each bag of soil has 4 cubic feet.
6) To calculate the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume per bag:
   * Number of bags = 64 cubic feet / 4 cubic feet per bag = 16 bags

Answer: 16 bags
