Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jake's dad can drive the distance from their house to the water park in 30 minutes
* He spends half that journey driving 28 miles per hour
* He spends the other half driving 60 miles per hour on the highway
* Jake can bike 11 miles per hour

First, we need to calculate the total distance from their house to the water park:
* Distance driven in the first half = 28 miles per hour x 15 minutes = 7 miles
* Distance driven in the second half = 60 miles per hour x 15 minutes = 15 miles
* Total distance = 7 miles + 15 miles = 22 miles

Now, we can calculate how long it will take Jake to bike the 22 miles:
* Jake can bike 11 miles per hour
* 22 miles / 11 miles per hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
