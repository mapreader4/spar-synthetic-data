Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The population of Port Perry is seven times as many as the population of Wellington.
   * If Wellington has a population of 900, then the population of Port Perry is 7 x 900 = 6,300.
2) The population of Port Perry is 800 more than the population of Lazy Harbor.
   * If the population of Port Perry is 6,300, then the population of Lazy Harbor is 6,300 - 800 = 5,500.
3) To find the combined population of Port Perry and Lazy Harbor, we add their individual populations:
   * 6,300 + 5,500 = 11,800.

Answer: 11,800
