Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Phoebe has 2 pizzas, each with 16 slices, for a total of 32 slices
* Phoebe is sharing the pizzas with 3 friends, for a total of 4 people
* One friend eats only pepperoni, so the remaining 3 people (Phoebe and 2 friends) have an equal number of slices of each type of pizza
* At the end, there is 1 slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left
* So the total number of slices eaten is 32 - 1 - 7 = 24 slices
* Since the 3 people who had an equal number of slices of each pizza ate 24 slices, each of them ate 24 / 3 = 8 slices
* The friend who ate only pepperoni ate the remaining 1 slice of pepperoni

Answer: 8 slices
