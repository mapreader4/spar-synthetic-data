Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recipe serves 4 people
* Perry added a half cup of cream at the end
* Cream has 88 grams of fat per cup

To calculate the grams of fat added to each serving, we need to:
1. Calculate the total grams of fat in the half cup of cream
2. Divide the total grams of fat by the number of servings (4)

Step 1: Calculate the total grams of fat in the half cup of cream
* 1 cup of cream has 88 grams of fat
* Half a cup of cream has 88 / 2 = 44 grams of fat

Step 2: Divide the total grams of fat by the number of servings
* 44 grams of fat / 4 servings = 11 grams of fat per serving

Answer: 11 grams
