Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Clarissa needs to get 10 copies of the manuscript printed and bound
* The manuscript is 400 pages long
* The printers charge $0.05 per page to copy it
* The printers charge $5.00 per manuscript to have it bound

First, let's calculate the cost of copying the manuscript 10 times:
* 400 pages per manuscript x 10 copies = 4,000 total pages
* 4,000 total pages x $0.05 per page = $200 for copying

Next, let's calculate the cost of binding the 10 manuscripts:
* 10 manuscripts x $5.00 per manuscript = $50 for binding

Finally, to get the total cost, we add the copying and binding costs:
* $200 (copying) + $50 (binding) = $250 total

Answer: $250
