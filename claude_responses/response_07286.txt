Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jacob has 18 hours left to finish his homework.
2) Greg has 6 hours less than Jacob, so Greg has 18 - 6 = 12 hours left.
3) Patrick has 4 hours less than twice the amount of time that Greg has left, so Patrick has 2 * 12 - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 hours left.
4) To find the total number of hours they all have left, we add up the individual hours:
Jacob: 18 hours
Greg: 12 hours
Patrick: 20 hours
Total: 18 + 12 + 20 = 50 hours

Answer: 50
