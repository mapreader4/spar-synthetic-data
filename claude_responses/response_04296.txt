Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bathtub can hold 6 cubic feet of water.
2) Each cubic foot of water is 7.5 gallons.
3) Therefore, the total volume of water in the bathtub is 6 cubic feet * 7.5 gallons/cubic foot = 45 gallons.
4) Since a gallon of water weighs 8 pounds, the total weight of the water in the bathtub is 45 gallons * 8 pounds/gallon = 360 pounds.
5) For every pound of water, you need 1.5 tablespoons of jello mix.
6) Therefore, the total amount of jello mix needed is 360 pounds * 1.5 tablespoons/pound = 540 tablespoons.
7) Each tablespoon of jello mix costs $0.50.
8) Therefore, the total cost of the jello mix is 540 tablespoons * $0.50/tablespoon = $270.

Answer: $270.
