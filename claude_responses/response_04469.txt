Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The class wants to order 35 English textbooks and 35 geography textbooks.
2) Each geography textbook costs $10.50.
3) Each English textbook costs $7.50.
4) To calculate the total cost of the geography textbooks, we multiply the number of geography textbooks (35) by the cost of each geography textbook ($10.50):
35 x $10.50 = $367.50
5) To calculate the total cost of the English textbooks, we multiply the number of English textbooks (35) by the cost of each English textbook ($7.50):
35 x $7.50 = $262.50
6) To get the total cost of the order, we add the cost of the geography textbooks and the cost of the English textbooks:
$367.50 + $262.50 = $630.00

Answer: $630
