Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim used to run 3 times a week
* He decided to add an extra 2 days a week, so now he runs 5 days a week
* He runs 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening every day he runs
* So, for each day he runs, he runs for 2 hours (1 hour in the morning + 1 hour in the evening)
* Since he runs 5 days a week, the total number of hours he runs per week is:
* 5 days per week x 2 hours per day = 10 hours per week

Answer: 10 hours
