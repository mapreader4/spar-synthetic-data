Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Steve makes $40,000 a year as a teacher
* He loses 20% to taxes
* He loses 10% to healthcare
* He also pays $800 in local union dues

First, let's calculate the amount he loses to taxes:
* 20% of $40,000 = 0.20 x $40,000 = $8,000

Next, let's calculate the amount he loses to healthcare:
* 10% of $40,000 = 0.10 x $40,000 = $4,000

Now, let's add up all the deductions:
* Taxes: $8,000
* Healthcare: $4,000
* Union dues: $800
* Total deductions: $8,000 + $4,000 + $800 = $12,800

Finally, let's calculate the amount of money Steve takes home:
* $40,000 - $12,800 = $27,200

Answer: $27,200
