Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Johnny worked 3 hours on a job that paid $7 per hour
* So for that job, he earned 3 hours x $7 per hour = $21
* He then worked 2 hours on a job that paid $10 per hour
* So for that job, he earned 2 hours x $10 per hour = $20
* Finally, he worked 4 hours on a job that paid $12 per hour
* So for that job, he earned 4 hours x $12 per hour = $48
* Adding up the earnings from all three jobs, we get $21 + $20 + $48 = $89 per day
* The question states that Johnny repeats this process 5 days in a row
* So to calculate his total earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 5 days
* $89 per day x 5 days = $445

Answer: $445
