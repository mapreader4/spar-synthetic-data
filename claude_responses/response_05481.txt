Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Grace has 30 pastries
* Calvin and Phoebe each have 5 less pastries than Grace
* So, Calvin and Phoebe each have 30 - 5 = 25 pastries
* Frank has 8 less pastries than Calvin and Phoebe
* So, Frank has 25 - 8 = 17 pastries
* To find the total number of pastries, we add up the pastries of all four:
* Grace: 30 pastries
* Calvin: 25 pastries
* Phoebe: 25 pastries
* Frank: 17 pastries
* Total = 30 + 25 + 25 + 17 = 97 pastries

Answer: 97
