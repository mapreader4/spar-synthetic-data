Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day
* So the mom dog eats 1.5 cups x 3 times = 4.5 cups per day
* There are 5 puppies, and each puppy eats 1/2 cup of food, twice a day
* So each puppy eats 1/2 cup x 2 times = 1 cup per day
* With 5 puppies, the total food for the puppies is 1 cup x 5 puppies = 5 cups per day
* The total food needed per day is the food for the mom dog (4.5 cups) plus the food for the puppies (5 cups), which is 4.5 cups + 5 cups = 9.5 cups per day
* For 6 days, the total food needed is 9.5 cups per day x 6 days = 57 cups
