Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* David finished his homework in 60 minutes total
* He spent 15 minutes on his math homework
* He spent 18 minutes on his spelling homework
* The rest of the time was spent reading for his daily reading log

To find the time he spent reading, we need to subtract the time spent on math and spelling from the total time:
* Total time: 60 minutes
* Time spent on math: 15 minutes
* Time spent on spelling: 18 minutes
* Time spent reading = Total time - Time spent on math - Time spent on spelling
* Time spent reading = 60 minutes - 15 minutes - 18 minutes = 27 minutes

Answer: 27 minutes
