Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James writes 10 pages per hour
* He writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people
* So, he writes 5 pages x 2 people = 10 pages per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* Therefore, he writes 10 pages per day x 7 days per week = 70 pages per week
* To find the number of hours he spends writing per week, we divide the total pages per week (70) by the pages per hour (10)
* 70 pages per week / 10 pages per hour = 7 hours per week

Answer: 7 hours
