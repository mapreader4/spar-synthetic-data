Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Troy bakes 2 pans of brownies, with 16 pieces per pan
* This means there are 2 * 16 = 32 total brownie pieces
* The guests eat all of 1 pan, which is 16 pieces
* They also eat 75% of the 2nd pan, which is 0.75 * 16 = 12 pieces
* So the total number of brownie pieces eaten is 16 + 12 = 28 pieces
* Each guest who eats the brownies ala mode (with 2 scoops of ice cream) will have 2 scoops of ice cream
* All but 4 of the guests eat the brownies ala mode, so (28 - 4) * 2 = 48 scoops of ice cream are eaten
* Each tub of ice cream provides 8 scoops
* To calculate the number of tubs of ice cream needed, we divide the total scoops eaten (48) by the scoops per tub (8)
* 48 / 8 = 6 tubs of ice cream

Answer: 6 tubs of ice cream
