Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rhett has been late on two of his monthly rent payments, but his landlord does not charge late fees.
2) He will be able to pay the total cost of the two late payments with 3/5 of his next month's salary after taxes.
3) Rhett is currently paid $5000 per month.
4) Rhett has to pay 10% tax.
5) To calculate his rent expense per month, we need to first find his take-home pay after taxes.
6) His take-home pay after 10% tax is $5000 - (0.10 * $5000) = $4500.
7) He can pay the total cost of the two late payments with 3/5 of his next month's salary, which is 3/5 * $4500 = $2700.
8) So the total cost of the two late payments is $2700.
9) Since the landlord does not charge late fees, the total cost of the two late payments is just the rent expense for those two months.
10) Therefore, the rent expense per month is $2700 / 2 = $1350.

Answer: $1350
