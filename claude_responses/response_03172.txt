Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* There are 3 friends who agreed to pay an equal amount of money for 5 bags of chips
* Each friend paid $5
* To find the cost of each bag of chips, we need to divide the total amount paid by the number of bags
* The total amount paid is 3 * $5 = $15
* The number of bags is 5
* To find the cost of each bag, we divide the total amount paid by the number of bags:
* $15 / 5 = $3 per bag
