Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Joseph had 16 baseball cards to start with.
2) He gave 3/8 of the cards to his brother.
3) To calculate 3/8 of 16 cards, we multiply 16 by 3/8:
   16 * 3/8 = 6 cards
4) He also gave 2 cards to his brother.
5) So in total, he gave away 6 + 2 = 8 cards.
6) To calculate the percentage of cards left to Joseph, we take the remaining cards and divide by the original number of cards:
   (16 - 8) / 16 = 8 / 16 = 0.5 = 50%

Answer: 50%
