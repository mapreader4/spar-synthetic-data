Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The friends hiked for 3.5 hours, which is 210 minutes.
2) They traveled 21 kilometers in that time.
3) Therefore, the average speed was 21 km / 210 minutes = 0.1 km/minute.
4) Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time, which means her pace was 0.1 km/minute + 4/60 km/minute = 0.167 km/minute.
5) To find how long it would take Birgit to go 8 kilometers, we divide the distance by her pace:
8 km / 0.167 km/minute = 48 minutes.

Answer: 48 minutes.
