Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Archie starts with an unknown number of marbles.
2) He loses 60% of them into the street.
3) Of the remaining marbles, he loses half down a sewer.
4) He has 20 marbles left.

Let's work backwards from the 20 marbles he has left.

We know that he lost half of the remaining marbles down the sewer. So, if he has 20 marbles left, then before losing half he had 40 marbles.

Now, we know that he lost 60% of his original amount of marbles into the street. So, if he had 40 marbles remaining after that, then his original amount must have been:
40 / (1 - 0.6) = 100 marbles

Therefore, Archie started with 100 marbles.

Answer: 100
