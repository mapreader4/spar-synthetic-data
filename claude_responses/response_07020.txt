Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emberly takes a walk every day
* Each walk takes her 1 hour and covers 4 miles
* She didn't walk for 4 days in March

To calculate the total number of miles she walked, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of days she walked in March
* There are 31 days in March
* She didn't walk for 4 days
* So, she walked for 31 - 4 = 27 days

2. Calculate the total number of miles she walked
* Each walk is 4 miles
* She walked for 27 days
* So, the total number of miles she walked is 27 * 4 = 108 miles

Answer: 108
