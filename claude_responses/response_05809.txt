Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each crate can hold up to 20kg
* Daryl has 15 crates he can fill
* So the total weight capacity of the 15 crates is:
  - 15 crates x 20kg per crate = 300kg
* Daryl has:
  - 4 bags of nails, each weighing 5kg, for a total of 4 x 5kg = 20kg
  - 12 bags of hammers, each weighing 5kg, for a total of 12 x 5kg = 60kg
  - 10 bags of wooden planks, each weighing 30kg, for a total of 10 x 30kg = 300kg
* The total weight of the items Daryl has is:
  - 20kg + 60kg + 300kg = 380kg
* The total weight capacity of the crates is 300kg
* Therefore, the amount Daryl will have to leave out is:
  - 380kg - 300kg = 80kg

Answer: 80
