Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yanna bought 60 apples
* She gave 18 apples to Zenny
* She gave 6 more apples to Andrea
* She kept the rest

First, let's calculate how many apples she gave away:
* 18 apples to Zenny
* 6 more apples to Andrea
* Total apples given away = 18 + 6 = 24 apples

Now, we can calculate how many apples she kept:
* She bought 60 apples
* She gave away 24 apples
* So, the number of apples she kept = 60 - 24 = 36 apples

Answer: 36 apples
