Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Voldemort's dinner consisted of:
- 1 piece of cake with 110 calories
- 1 pack of chips with 310 calories
- 1 bottle of coke with 215 calories
2) The total calories from his dinner are:
110 + 310 + 215 = 635 calories
3) His caloric intake for breakfast and lunch is:
560 + 780 = 1340 calories
4) His total caloric intake so far is:
635 + 1340 = 1975 calories
5) His daily calorie intake limit is 2500 calories
6) To calculate how many more calories he can take, we subtract his current intake from his daily limit:
2500 - 1975 = 525 calories

Answer: 525
