Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2) His father gave him 13 more biscuits.
   * So now Randy has 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3) His mother gave him 15 more biscuits.
   * So now Randy has 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4) Randy's brother ate 20 of these biscuits.
   * So now Randy has 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Answer: 40
