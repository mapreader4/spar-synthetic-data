Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ping pong balls sell for $0.10 each.
2) Johnny buys 10,000 ping pong balls.
3) He gets a 30% discount for buying in such large bulk.
4) To calculate the total cost before the discount:
   * 10,000 ping pong balls x $0.10 per ball = $1,000
5) To calculate the discount amount:
   * 30% of $1,000 = 0.30 x $1,000 = $300
6) To calculate the total amount Johnny pays after the discount:
   * $1,000 - $300 = $700

Answer: $700
