Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On Monday, it rained for 7 hours at a rate of 1 inch per hour.
* The total rainfall on Monday = 7 hours x 1 inch/hour = 7 inches

On Tuesday, it rained for 4 hours at a rate of 2 inches per hour.
* The total rainfall on Tuesday = 4 hours x 2 inches/hour = 8 inches

On Wednesday, it rained for 2 hours at a rate of twice the previous day, which was 2 inches/hour.
* The rate on Wednesday = 2 x 2 inches/hour = 4 inches/hour
* The total rainfall on Wednesday = 2 hours x 4 inches/hour = 8 inches

Now, to calculate the total combined rainfall for the three days:
* Total rainfall = Rainfall on Monday + Rainfall on Tuesday + Rainfall on Wednesday
* Total rainfall = 7 inches + 8 inches + 8 inches = 23 inches

Answer: 23 inches
