Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The store put out a product sample every Saturday
* Last Saturday, the sample product came in boxes of 20
* They had to open 12 boxes
* They had 5 samples left over at the end of the day

To find the number of customers who tried a sample, we need to calculate the total number of samples available and then subtract the number of samples left over.

First, let's calculate the total number of samples available:
* 12 boxes x 20 samples per box = 240 total samples

Now, we subtract the 5 samples left over:
* 240 total samples - 5 samples left over = 235 samples taken by customers

Therefore, the number of customers who tried a sample is:
Answer: 235
