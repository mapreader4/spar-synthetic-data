Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the original batch of mud, Anderson added 3 sprigs of mint.
2. For every sprig of mint, he added 2 green tea leaves.
3. So, for the original batch of mud, he added 3 * 2 = 6 green tea leaves.

4. However, the new kind of mud makes the other ingredients half as effective.
5. This means that to get the same efficacy as before, Anderson needs to add twice as many green tea leaves.
6. Therefore, to get the same efficacy as before, Anderson should add 6 * 2 = 12 green tea leaves.

Answer: 12
