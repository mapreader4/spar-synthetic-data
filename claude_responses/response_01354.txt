Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Archie's backyard measures 20 yards by 13 yards.
2) The area of the backyard is the length times the width, which is 20 yards x 13 yards = 260 square yards.
3) Archie has a shed in the backyard that measures 3 yards by 5 yards.
4) The area of the shed is the length times the width, which is 3 yards x 5 yards = 15 square yards.
5) To find the total area of sod Archie needs, we take the area of the backyard (260 square yards) and subtract the area of the shed (15 square yards).
6) 260 square yards - 15 square yards = 245 square yards.

Answer: 245 square yards.
