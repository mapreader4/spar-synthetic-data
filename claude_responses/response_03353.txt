Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students
* To calculate the total number of cards given to the students, we multiply 23 cards per student by 15 students:
  * 23 cards per student x 15 students = 345 cards
* Joseph had 12 cards left
* To find the total number of cards Joseph had at first, we add the number of cards given to the students (345) and the number of cards left (12):
  * 345 cards + 12 cards = 357 cards

Answer: 357
