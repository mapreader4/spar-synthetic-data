Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that in five years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew.
2) We also know that Drew is currently 12 years old.
3) So in five years, Drew will be 12 + 5 = 17 years old.
4) Since Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew in five years, we can say that Sam's age in five years will be 3 * 17 = 51.
5) Therefore, Sam's current age is 51 - 5 = 46.

Answer: 46
