Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Matilda bought a smartphone for $300.
2) She then sold the smartphone for $255.
3) To calculate the percentage of the initial cost that she lost, we need to find the difference between the initial cost and the selling price, and then divide that by the initial cost.
4) The difference between the initial cost and the selling price is $300 - $255 = $45.
5) The percentage of the initial cost that she lost is $45 / $300 = 0.15 or 15%.
