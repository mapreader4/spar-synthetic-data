Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James buys 20 pounds of beef and half that much pork, which is 10 pounds of pork.
2) The total amount of meat he bought is 20 pounds of beef + 10 pounds of pork = 30 pounds of meat.
3) He uses 1.5 pounds of meat to make each meal at his restaurant.
4) To calculate the number of meals he can make, we divide the total amount of meat (30 pounds) by the amount of meat used per meal (1.5 pounds):
30 pounds / 1.5 pounds per meal = 20 meals
5) Each meal sells for $20.
6) To calculate the total money he made, we multiply the number of meals (20) by the price per meal ($20):
20 meals x $20 per meal = $400

Answer: $400
