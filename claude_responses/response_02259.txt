Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first laptop costs $500
* The second laptop is 3 times as costly as the first laptop
* To find the cost of the second laptop, we multiply the cost of the first laptop by 3:
  * Cost of second laptop = $500 x 3 = $1,500
* To find the total cost if Adam buys both laptops, we add the cost of the first laptop and the cost of the second laptop:
  * Total cost = $500 + $1,500 = $2,000

Answer: $2,000
