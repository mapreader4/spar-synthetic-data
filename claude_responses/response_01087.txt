Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Initially, Hadley arranged 100 books on the shelf
* By lunchtime, a certain number of books had been borrowed
* After lunchtime, Hadley added 40 more books to the same shelf
* By evening, 30 more books had been borrowed
* By evening, there were 60 books remaining on the shelf

To find the number of books borrowed by lunchtime, we can work backwards from the final state of the shelf.

* By evening, there were 60 books remaining
* 30 more books were borrowed by evening
* So, the total number of books on the shelf before the 30 books were borrowed was 60 + 30 = 90 books

* After lunchtime, Hadley added 40 more books to the shelf
* So, the total number of books on the shelf after lunchtime was 90 - 40 = 50 books

* Initially, there were 100 books on the shelf
* So, the number of books borrowed by lunchtime was 100 - 50 = 50 books

Answer: 50
