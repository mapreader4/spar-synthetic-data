Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 100 tennis balls
* He gives half of them away
* The remaining half are put into 5 large containers
* To find the number of tennis balls in each container, we need to:
  1. Calculate the number of tennis balls remaining after giving half away
  2. Divide the remaining tennis balls by the number of containers (5)

Step 1: Calculating the number of tennis balls remaining
* James gave away half of the 100 tennis balls
* So, the number of tennis balls remaining is 100 - (100 / 2) = 50 tennis balls

Step 2: Dividing the remaining tennis balls by the number of containers
* There are 50 tennis balls remaining
* They are divided into 5 containers
* So, the number of tennis balls in each container is 50 / 5 = 10 tennis balls
