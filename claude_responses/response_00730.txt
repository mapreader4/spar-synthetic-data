Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack bought 3 books a month
* Each book costs $20
* He bought books for 12 months (1 year)
* So, the total cost of the books he bought is:
  * 3 books per month x $20 per book x 12 months = $720
* At the end of the year, he sold the books back for $500
* To calculate the amount of money he lost, we take the total cost of the books ($720) and subtract the amount he got back from selling them ($500)
* $720 - $500 = $220

Answer: $220
