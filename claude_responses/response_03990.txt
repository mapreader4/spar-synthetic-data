Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The charity has 100 plates to deliver
* The rice costs 10 cents per plate
* The chicken costs 40 cents per plate
* To calculate the total cost of the rice:
  * 100 plates x 10 cents per plate = 1000 cents
  * 1000 cents = $10
* To calculate the total cost of the chicken:
  * 100 plates x 40 cents per plate = 4000 cents
  * 4000 cents = $40
* To calculate the total cost of the food:
  * $10 (rice) + $40 (chicken) = $50

Answer: $50
