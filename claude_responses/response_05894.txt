Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The employee makes $30 per hour for the first 40 hours in the workweek
* For any hours above 40 in the workweek, the employee makes an additional 50% of the $30 per hour rate
* For the first 3 days, the employee works 6 hours per day
* For the remaining 2 days, the employee works twice as many hours per day as the first 3 days

First, let's calculate the hours worked in the first 3 days:
* 6 hours per day x 3 days = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate the hours worked in the remaining 2 days:
* 6 hours per day x 2 = 12 hours per day
* 12 hours per day x 2 days = 24 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked in the workweek:
* 18 hours + 24 hours = 42 hours

Since the employee makes $30 per hour for the first 40 hours, and an additional 50% for the remaining 2 hours, we can calculate the total earnings as follows:
* 40 hours x $30 per hour = $1,200
* 2 hours x $45 per hour (50% more than $30) = $90
* Total earnings = $1,200 + $90 = $1,290

Answer: $1,290
