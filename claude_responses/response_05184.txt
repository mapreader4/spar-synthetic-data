Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* One pair of pants requires 8.5 feet of fabric
* Nguyen needs to make 7 pairs of pants
* So the total fabric required for 7 pairs of pants is:
    * 7 pairs x 8.5 feet per pair = 59.5 feet of fabric
* Nguyen has 3.5 yards of fabric
* 1 yard = 3 feet
* So 3.5 yards = 3.5 x 3 = 10.5 feet of fabric
* The amount of fabric Nguyen still needs is:
    * 59.5 feet - 10.5 feet = 49 feet

Answer: 49
