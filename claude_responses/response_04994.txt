Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Amy, Jeremy, and Chris have a combined age of 132
* Amy is 1/3 the age of Jeremy
* Chris is twice as old as Amy

Let's start by finding Amy's age:
* If Amy is 1/3 the age of Jeremy, then we can represent Amy's age as 1/3 * Jeremy's age

Now, we know that Chris is twice as old as Amy, so we can represent Chris's age as 2 * Amy's age, which is 2 * (1/3 * Jeremy's age) = 2/3 * Jeremy's age

We know the combined age of the three is 132, so we can set up an equation:
* Amy's age + Jeremy's age + Chris's age = 132
* (1/3 * Jeremy's age) + Jeremy's age + (2/3 * Jeremy's age) = 132
* 2 * Jeremy's age = 132
* Jeremy's age = 132 / 2 = 66

Answer: 66
