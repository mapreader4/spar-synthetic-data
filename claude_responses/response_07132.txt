Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Anna used 4 baking trays to bake cupcakes.
2) Each tray has 20 cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes baked is 4 trays x 20 cupcakes per tray = 80 cupcakes.
3) Each cupcake was sold for $2.
4) Only 3/5 of the cupcakes were sold, so the number of cupcakes sold is 3/5 x 80 = 48 cupcakes.
5) The total amount earned from selling the 48 cupcakes is 48 cupcakes x $2 per cupcake = $96.

Answer: $96.
