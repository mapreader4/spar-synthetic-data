Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

In the first hour:
* Dan makes one t-shirt every 12 minutes
* There are 60 minutes in an hour
* So in the first hour, he can make 60 minutes / 12 minutes per t-shirt = 5 t-shirts

In the second hour:
* Dan makes one t-shirt every 6 minutes
* There are 60 minutes in an hour
* So in the second hour, he can make 60 minutes / 6 minutes per t-shirt = 10 t-shirts

Now, to find the total number of t-shirts he makes over the two hours:
* Total t-shirts = t-shirts in first hour + t-shirts in second hour
* Total t-shirts = 5 + 10 = 15 t-shirts

Answer: 15
