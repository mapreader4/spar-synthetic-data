Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. The tomato plant has 100 tomatoes.
2. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. 1/4 of 100 is 25 tomatoes.
3. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes.
4. The following week, she picks twice the number she picked the previous week, which is 2 x 20 = 40 tomatoes.
5. So the total number of tomatoes picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes.
6. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes.

Answer: 15
