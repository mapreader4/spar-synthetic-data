Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Olivia has $112 and Nigel has $139, so together they have $112 + $139 = $251 to start with.
2) They want to buy 6 one-day passes to a tourist attraction, and each ticket costs $28.
3) To calculate the total cost of the 6 tickets, we multiply the number of tickets (6) by the cost per ticket ($28):
6 x $28 = $168
4) Now, to find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total cost of the tickets ($168) from the total amount of money they had ($251):
$251 - $168 = $83

Answer: $83
