Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Friday, Markeesha sold 30 boxes of crackers.

2. On Saturday, she sold twice as many as on Friday. That means she sold 2 x 30 = 60 boxes.

3. On Sunday, she sold 15 fewer than Saturday. That means she sold 60 - 15 = 45 boxes.

Now, to find the total number of boxes she sold over the three days, we add up the sales from each day:
Friday: 30 boxes
Saturday: 60 boxes
Sunday: 45 boxes

Total boxes sold = 30 + 60 + 45 = 135 boxes

Answer: 135
