Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Arabella spends 30 minutes learning the first step.

2. The second step takes half the time of the first step, which is 30 / 2 = 15 minutes.

3. The third step takes as long as both the other steps, which is 30 + 15 = 45 minutes.

Now, we add up the time spent on all three steps:
30 minutes + 15 minutes + 45 minutes = 90 minutes.

Answer: 90
