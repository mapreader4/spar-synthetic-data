Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The town square is 3/4 of a mile long
* The winner ran around the town square 7 times
* So the total distance of the race is 7 * 3/4 = 21/4 = 5.25 miles
* This year's winner finished the race in 42 minutes
* Last year's winner finished the race in 47.25 minutes
* To find the average time difference per mile, we need to calculate the time difference between the two winners and divide it by the total distance:
* Time difference = 47.25 minutes - 42 minutes = 5.25 minutes
* Average time difference per mile = 5.25 minutes / 5.25 miles = 1 minute
