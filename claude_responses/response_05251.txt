Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Donna made a cake to take to a party.
2) The guests ate half the cake at the party.
3) The day after the party, Donna shared half the leftovers with her brothers.
4) The following day, Donna ate one piece as a midnight snack.
5) Twice as many pieces as her snack were left.

Let's start by assuming the cake was initially cut into x pieces.
* At the party, the guests ate half the cake, so half of the x pieces were eaten, leaving x/2 pieces.
* The day after the party, Donna shared half the leftovers with her brothers, so she had x/4 pieces left.
* The following day, Donna ate one piece, leaving x/4 - 1 pieces.
* Twice as many pieces as her snack were left, so there were 2 pieces left.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x/4 - 1 = 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 12

Answer: 12
