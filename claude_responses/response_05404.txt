Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Lauren sent 65 pieces of mail.
* On Tuesday, she sent 10 more pieces of mail than on Monday, so that's 65 + 10 = 75 pieces of mail.
* On Wednesday, she sent 5 fewer pieces of mail than on Tuesday, so that's 75 - 5 = 70 pieces of mail.
* On Thursday, she sent 15 more pieces of mail than on Wednesday, so that's 70 + 15 = 85 pieces of mail.

Now, to find the total number of pieces of mail that Lauren sent, we add up the pieces sent each day:
* 65 + 75 + 70 + 85 = 295 pieces of mail.

Answer: 295
