Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The taco truck buys 100 pounds of beef.
2) They use 0.25 pounds of beef per taco.
3) To find the total number of tacos they can make with 100 pounds of beef, we divide 100 by 0.25:
100 pounds / 0.25 pounds per taco = 400 tacos
4) They sell each taco for $2.
5) Each taco costs $1.5 to make.
6) The profit per taco is the selling price minus the cost to make it: $2 - $1.5 = $0.5 per taco.
7) The total profit they made by selling all 400 tacos is the profit per taco multiplied by the total number of tacos: $0.5 x 400 = $200.

Answer: $200
