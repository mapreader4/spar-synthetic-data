Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Holly gets 26 paychecks per year.
2) She puts $100.00 from every paycheck into her 401K.
3) Her company will match that contribution by 6%.
4) To calculate the total amount contributed by Holly in 1 year:
   - Holly contributes $100.00 per paycheck
   - She gets 26 paychecks per year
   - So, Holly contributes $100.00 x 26 = $2,600.00 per year
5) To calculate the amount contributed by the company:
   - The company matches Holly's contribution by 6%
   - Holly contributes $2,600.00 per year
   - 6% of $2,600.00 is $156.00
6) The total amount contributed to Holly's 401K after 1 year is the sum of Holly's contribution and the company's contribution:
   - Holly's contribution: $2,600.00
   - Company's contribution: $156.00
   - Total contribution: $2,600.00 + $156.00 = $2,756.00

Answer: $2,756
