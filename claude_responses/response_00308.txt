Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason needs to add 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water
* He is adding 900 ml of water
* To find the amount of charcoal he needs to add, we can set up a proportion:
* 2 grams of charcoal / 30 ml of water = x grams of charcoal / 900 ml of water
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 2 * 900 = 30x
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = 60 grams of charcoal

Answer: 60
