Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leila spent some amount at the supermarket
* The cost of fixing her automobile was $350
* The cost of fixing her automobile was $50 more than thrice the amount she spent at the supermarket

Let's call the amount Leila spent at the supermarket 'x'.
* The cost of fixing her automobile was $50 more than thrice the amount she spent at the supermarket
* So the cost of fixing her automobile was 3x + $50
* We know the cost of fixing her automobile was $350
* Therefore, 3x + $50 = $350
* Solving for x, we get x = $100

Now we can calculate the total amount Leila has spent:
* Amount spent at the supermarket: $100
* Amount spent at the mechanic: $350
* Total amount spent: $100 + $350 = $450

Answer: $450
