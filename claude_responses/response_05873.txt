Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 4 classrooms in total.
2) The total number of students is the sum of the boys and girls: 56 boys + 44 girls = 100 students.
3) The goal is to have an equal number of boys and girls in each classroom.
4) To achieve this, we need to divide the total number of boys and girls equally among the 4 classrooms.
5) The number of boys and girls in each classroom should be equal, so we need to divide the total number of boys and girls by 2 to get the number of students in each classroom.
6) 100 students / 4 classrooms = 25 students per classroom.

Answer: 25
