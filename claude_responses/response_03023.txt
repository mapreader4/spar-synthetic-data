Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lola and Dora each have an allowance of $9.
2) They combine their allowance to buy a deck of playing cards for $10.
3) They also buy $2 boxes of stickers and split them evenly.
4) To find the total amount they spent on the stickers, we add their combined allowance ($9 + $9 = $18) and subtract the cost of the playing cards ($10):
$18 - $10 = $8
5) Since each box of stickers costs $2, they were able to buy $8 / $2 = 4 boxes of stickers.
6) Since Lola and Dora split the boxes evenly, Dora got half of the 4 boxes, which is 2 boxes of stickers.
