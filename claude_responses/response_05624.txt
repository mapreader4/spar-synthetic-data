Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry's total debt was $50
* Two months ago, he paid $12 towards his debt
* Last month, he paid $3 more than the previous month, which is $12 + $3 = $15
* So, the total amount Jerry has paid towards his debt so far is $12 + $15 = $27
* To find how much he still has to pay, we take the original debt of $50 and subtract the amount he has already paid, which is $27
* $50 - $27 = $23

Answer: $23
