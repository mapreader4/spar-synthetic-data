Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 18 green leaves on each of the 3 tea leaf plants.
2) So the total number of green leaves on all 3 plants is 18 x 3 = 54 green leaves.
3) One-third of the 54 green leaves turn yellow and fall off.
4) One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18 leaves.
5) So 18 green leaves turn yellow and fall off.
6) The remaining green leaves are 54 - 18 = 36 green leaves.

Answer: 36
