Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The work takes 2 hours.
2) The mechanic charges $75 per hour.
3) The part costs $150.
4) To calculate the total cost, we need to add the labor cost and the part cost:
   - Labor cost = 2 hours x $75 per hour = $150
   - Part cost = $150
   - Total cost = Labor cost + Part cost = $150 + $150 = $300

Answer: $300
