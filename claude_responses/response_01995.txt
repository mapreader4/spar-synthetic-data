Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 18 hours ago, Beth and I took 100 photographs of the project
* Today, we will take 20% fewer photographs of the same project
* To calculate the number of photographs taken today:
    - 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20
    - So we will take 100 - 20 = 80 photographs today
* The target is 300 photographs
* To calculate how many more photographs we need to reach the target:
    - We have taken 100 + 80 = 180 photographs so far
    - The target is 300 photographs
    - So we need 300 - 180 = 120 more photographs to reach the target

Answer: 120
