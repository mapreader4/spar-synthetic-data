Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Terry drives at a speed of 40 miles per hour
* The distance from his home to his workplace is 60 miles
* He drives this distance both ways, so the total distance he drives is 60 miles + 60 miles = 120 miles

To calculate the time it takes him to drive this distance, we can use the formula:
* Time = Distance / Speed

Plugging in the values:
* Time = 120 miles / 40 miles per hour
* Time = 3 hours

Therefore, Terry spends 3 hours driving from home to the workplace and then back.
