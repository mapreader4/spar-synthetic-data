Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first stack was 7 blocks high
* The second stack was 5 blocks higher than the first, so it was 7 + 5 = 12 blocks high
* The final stack was 7 blocks higher than the second, so it was 12 + 7 = 19 blocks high
* In the first tower, all 7 blocks fell down
* In the second tower, 12 - 2 = 10 blocks fell down
* In the final tower, 19 - 3 = 16 blocks fell down
* To find the total number of blocks that fell down, we add up the blocks from each tower:
* 7 + 10 + 16 = 33 blocks

Answer: 33
