Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Christine's commission rate is 12%, which means she earns 12% of the total sales as her commission.
2) The total sales for the month were $24,000.
3) To calculate her commission, we take 12% of the total sales:
   * Commission = 12% of $24,000 = 0.12 x $24,000 = $2,880
4) Now, we know that 60% of her earnings will be allocated to her personal needs, and the remaining 40% will be saved.
5) To calculate the amount she saved, we take 40% of her commission:
   * Amount Saved = 40% of $2,880 = 0.40 x $2,880 = $1,152

Answer: $1,152
