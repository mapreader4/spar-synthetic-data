Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We are given that 20 gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers.
2) To find the amount of tea in each container, we divide the total amount of tea (20 gallons) by the number of containers (80):
20 gallons / 80 containers = 0.25 gallons per container
3) We are told that Geraldo drank 3.5 containers.
4) To find the amount of tea Geraldo drank, we multiply the amount of tea per container (0.25 gallons) by the number of containers Geraldo drank (3.5):
0.25 gallons per container x 3.5 containers = 0.875 gallons
5) There are 8 pints in a gallon, so to convert 0.875 gallons to pints, we multiply by 8:
0.875 gallons x 8 pints/gallon = 7 pints

Answer: 7 pints
