Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leslie took 10 photos of animals
* Leslie took 3 times as many photos of flowers as animals
* So, if Leslie took 10 photos of animals, she took 3 x 10 = 30 photos of flowers
* Leslie took 10 fewer scenery photos than the number of flower photos
* So, if Leslie took 30 photos of flowers, she took 30 - 10 = 20 photos of scenery
* In total, Leslie took 10 (animals) + 30 (flowers) + 20 (scenery) = 60 photos
* Lisa took 15 fewer photos last weekend
* So, if Leslie took 60 photos, Lisa took 60 - 15 = 45 photos last weekend

Answer: 45
