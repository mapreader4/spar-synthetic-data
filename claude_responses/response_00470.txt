Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gary normally earns $12 per hour
* He worked overtime, where every hour after 40 he earns 1.5 times his normal wage
* His paycheck before taxes was $696

First, let's calculate his normal wage for 40 hours:
* 40 hours x $12 per hour = $480

Now, let's calculate the overtime pay:
* The remaining hours (total hours - 40) are paid at 1.5 times the normal wage
* Let's call the total hours worked 'x'
* Overtime pay = (x - 40) * 1.5 * $12

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the total hours worked:
* Total pay = Normal wage + Overtime pay
* $696 = $480 + (x - 40) * 1.5 * $12
* $696 = $480 + $18(x - 40)
* $216 = $18x - $720
* $936 = $18x
* x = 52

Therefore, Gary worked 52 hours that week.
