Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The class has 32 students
* Each student needs 5 minutes to present their project
* Each period is 40 minutes long

To calculate the number of periods it will take for every student to present their project, we need to find out how many students can present their projects in one period.

* In one 40-minute period, there are 40 minutes / 5 minutes per presentation = 8 students who can present their projects.

Now, we need to find out how many periods it will take to accommodate all 32 students.

* 32 students / 8 students per period = 4 periods

Therefore, it will take 4 periods for every student to present their project.

Answer: 4
