Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Eustace is twice as old as Milford. This means that Eustace's current age is 2 times Milford's current age.
2) In 3 years, Eustace will be 39. This means that Eustace's current age is 39 - 3 = 36.
3) Since Eustace is twice as old as Milford, we can say that Milford's current age is 36 / 2 = 18.
4) Therefore, Milford will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

Answer: 21
