Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary ran 3/8 of a 24-kilometer field.
   * Mary's distance = 3/8 * 24 = 9 kilometers

2) Edna ran 2/3 of the distance of Edna.
   * This is a typo, it should be "Edna ran 2/3 of the distance of Mary".
   * Edna's distance = 2/3 * 9 = 6 kilometers

3) Lucy ran 5/6 of the distance of Edna.
   * Lucy's distance = 5/6 * 6 = 5 kilometers

4) To find how many more kilometers Lucy should run to cover the same distance as Mary, we subtract Lucy's distance from Mary's distance.
   * Difference = Mary's distance - Lucy's distance
   * Difference = 9 kilometers - 5 kilometers = 4 kilometers

Answer: 4 kilometers
