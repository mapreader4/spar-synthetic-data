Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that the population of Boise is 3/5 times the population of Seattle.
2. We also know that the population of Lake View is 24000.
3. We know that the population of Lake View is 4000 more than the population of Seattle.
4. So, if the population of Lake View is 24000, and it is 4000 more than the population of Seattle, then the population of Seattle must be 20000.
5. Now, we can use the information about Boise's population being 3/5 times the population of Seattle to calculate Boise's population.
6. If Seattle's population is 20000, then Boise's population is 3/5 * 20000 = 12000.
7. To find the total population of the three cities, we add the populations of Boise, Seattle, and Lake View:
12000 + 20000 + 24000 = 56000.

Answer: 56000
