Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The housewife had $150 to start with
* She spent 2/3 of her $150
* To calculate how much she spent, we take 2/3 of $150:
    * 2/3 of $150 = (2/3) * $150 = $100
* So, she spent $100 at the market
* To calculate how much she has left, we take the original $150 and subtract the $100 she spent:
    * $150 - $100 = $50

Answer: 50
