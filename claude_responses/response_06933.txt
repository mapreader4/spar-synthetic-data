Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The school cafeteria makes 100 lasagnas, and each lasagna uses 2 pounds of ground mince.
2) So the total amount of ground mince used for the lasagnas is 100 lasagnas x 2 pounds per lasagna = 200 pounds.
3) The cafeteria has used 500 pounds of ground mince in total.
4) The remaining ground mince, after the lasagnas, is 500 pounds - 200 pounds = 300 pounds.
5) Each cottage pie uses 3 pounds of ground mince.
6) So the number of cottage pies made is 300 pounds / 3 pounds per cottage pie = 100 cottage pies.

Answer: 100
