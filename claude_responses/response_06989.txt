Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The artist spends 30 hours every week painting
* It takes her 3 hours to complete a painting
* We want to find how many paintings she can make in four weeks

First, let's calculate how many paintings she can make in one week:
* 30 hours per week / 3 hours per painting = 10 paintings per week

Now, we can calculate how many paintings she can make in four weeks:
* 10 paintings per week x 4 weeks = 40 paintings

Answer: 40
