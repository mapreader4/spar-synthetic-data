Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Frank bought 10 buns for $0.1 each. So the total cost of the buns is:
10 buns x $0.1 per bun = $1

2) Frank bought two bottles of milk for $2 each. So the total cost of the milk is:
2 bottles x $2 per bottle = $4

3) The carton of eggs was three times more expensive than one bottle of milk. So if one bottle of milk costs $2, then the carton of eggs would cost:
3 x $2 = $6

4) To calculate the total cost of Frank's breakfast shopping, we add up the costs of the buns, milk, and eggs:
$1 + $4 + $6 = $11

Answer: $11
