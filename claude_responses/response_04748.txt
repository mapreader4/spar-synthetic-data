Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar.
2) Martha spent half as much as Doris, which means she spent $3.
3) The total amount spent from the cookie jar is $6 (Doris) + $3 (Martha) = $9.
4) There was $15 left in the cookie jar.
5) To find the original amount in the cookie jar, we add the amount spent ($9) and the amount left ($15):
$9 + $15 = $24.

Answer: $24
