Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Daria wants to buy tickets for herself and 3 of her friends, so that's a total of 4 tickets.
2) Each ticket costs $90.
3) To calculate the total cost of the tickets, we multiply the number of tickets (4) by the cost per ticket ($90):
4 x $90 = $360
4) Daria currently has $189, so we need to find the difference between the total cost and the amount she currently has:
$360 - $189 = $171
Therefore, Daria needs to earn $171 more to be able to buy the tickets.

Answer: 171
