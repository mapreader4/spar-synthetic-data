Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Let's say Jordan has x Oreos
* James has 7 more than 4 times the number of Oreos Jordan has
* So James has 4x + 7 Oreos
* The total number of Oreos is 52
* So we can write the equation:
x + (4x + 7) = 52
* Solving for x:
5x + 7 = 52
5x = 45
x = 9
* Therefore, Jordan has 9 Oreos
* And James has 4(9) + 7 = 43 Oreos

Answer: 43
