Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The treadmill originally costs $1350.
2. The treadmill is on a 30% discount.
   * To calculate the discount, we take 30% of $1350, which is $405.
   * The discounted price of the treadmill is $1350 - $405 = $945.

3. Andre also bought 2 pieces of 45-pound plates for $50 each.
   * The total cost of the plates is 2 x $50 = $100.

4. To find the total amount Andre paid, we add the discounted price of the treadmill and the cost of the plates:
   * $945 + $100 = $1045

Answer: $1045
