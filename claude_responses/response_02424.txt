Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bryan's score on the math exam is 20 points.
* Jen scored 10 more than Bryan, so Jen's score is 20 + 10 = 30 points.
* Sammy scored 2 fewer than Jen, so Sammy's score is 30 - 2 = 28 points.
* The math exam has a total of 35 points.
* To find the number of mistakes Sammy made, we need to subtract his score from the total points:
* 35 points - 28 points = 7 mistakes.

Answer: 7
