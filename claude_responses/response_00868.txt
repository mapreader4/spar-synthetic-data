Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The flagpole is 12 feet tall.
2) The flagpole breaks and folds over in half, such that the tip of the flagpole is now dangling 2 feet above the ground.
3) Let's call the distance from the base where the flagpole broke "x".
4) Since the flagpole folded in half, the distance from the base to the tip of the flagpole is now 6 feet (half of the original 12 feet).
5) The tip of the flagpole is now 2 feet above the ground, so the distance from the base to the tip is 6 + 2 = 8 feet.
6) Therefore, the distance from the base where the flagpole broke is 12 - 8 = 4 feet.

Answer: 4 feet
