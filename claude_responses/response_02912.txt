Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The top level has 64 books.
2) Each level has 80% as many books as the previous level.
3) To find the number of books in the previous level, we multiply the number of books in the top level by 1/0.8 = 1.25.
4) The number of books in the second level is 64 * 1.25 = 80 books.
5) The number of books in the third level is 80 * 1.25 = 100 books.
6) The number of books in the fourth level is 100 * 1.25 = 125 books.
7) To find the total number of books in the pyramid, we add up the number of books in each level:
64 + 80 + 100 + 125 = 369 books.

Answer: 369
