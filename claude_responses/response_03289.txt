Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For the first wing:
* 9 floors
* Each floor has 6 halls
* Each hall has 32 rooms
* So, the total number of rooms in the first wing is:
  * 9 floors x 6 halls per floor x 32 rooms per hall = 1,728 rooms

For the second wing:
* 7 floors
* Each floor has 9 halls
* Each hall has 40 rooms
* So, the total number of rooms in the second wing is:
  * 7 floors x 9 halls per floor x 40 rooms per hall = 2,520 rooms

To find the total number of rooms in the hotel, we add the rooms from both wings:
* 1,728 rooms + 2,520 rooms = 4,248 rooms

Answer: 4,248
