Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joy has 30 pencils
2) Colleen has 50 pencils
3) Each pencil costs $4
4) To calculate how much Joy paid for her pencils, we multiply the number of pencils (30) by the cost per pencil ($4):
30 pencils x $4 per pencil = $120
5) To calculate how much Colleen paid for her pencils, we multiply the number of pencils (50) by the cost per pencil ($4):
50 pencils x $4 per pencil = $200
6) To calculate the difference in what Colleen and Joy paid, we subtract Joy's total ($120) from Colleen's total ($200):
$200 - $120 = $80

Answer: $80
