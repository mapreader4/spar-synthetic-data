Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lance has 70 cents
* Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar
* Three-fourths of a dollar is 75 cents
* Guy has two quarters and a dime
* Two quarters is 50 cents, and a dime is 10 cents, so Guy has 60 cents
* Bill has six dimes
* Six dimes is 60 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of cents they have combined:
* Lance: 70 cents
* Margaret: 75 cents
* Guy: 60 cents
* Bill: 60 cents
* Total: 70 + 75 + 60 + 60 = 265 cents

Answer: 265
