Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mindy has 7 less than 9 times as many emails as phone messages.
2) Let's say the number of phone messages is x.
3) Then the number of emails is 9x - 7.
4) The total number of emails and phone messages is 93.
5) So we can write the equation: x + (9x - 7) = 93
6) Simplifying, we get: 10x - 7 = 93
7) Solving for x, we get: 10x = 100, so x = 10.
8) Therefore, the number of emails is 9x - 7 = 9(10) - 7 = 83.

Answer: 83
