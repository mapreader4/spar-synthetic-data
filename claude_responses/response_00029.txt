Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, Mrs. Snyder spent 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities.
2) Her salary was recently increased by $600.
3) Now, her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income.

Let's call her previous monthly income "x".
* Initially, she spent 40% of x on rent and utilities, which is 0.4x.
* Her new monthly income is x + $600.
* Now, she spends 25% of her new monthly income on rent and utilities, which is 0.25(x + $600).

Since the amount she spends on rent and utilities is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:
0.4x = 0.25(x + $600)

Solving for x:
0.4x = 0.25x + $150
0.15x = $150
x = $1,000

Therefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1,000.

Answer: $1,000
