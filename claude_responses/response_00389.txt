Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) During the first 15 days of November, it rained 4 inches per day.
2) So the total rainfall for the first 15 days is:
   4 inches per day x 15 days = 60 inches
3) For the remainder of the month (16 days), the average daily rainfall was twice the amount observed during the first 15 days.
4) So the average daily rainfall for the remaining 16 days was 4 inches x 2 = 8 inches per day.
5) The total rainfall for the remaining 16 days is:
   8 inches per day x 16 days = 128 inches
6) The total rainfall for the entire month of November is the sum of the rainfall for the first 15 days and the remaining 16 days:
   60 inches + 128 inches = 188 inches

Answer: 188
