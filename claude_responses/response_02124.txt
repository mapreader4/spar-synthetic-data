Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James earns $10 per week as an allowance.
* He saves all his money for four weeks.
* So, in four weeks, he saves 4 x $10 = $40.
* He then spends half of the $40 on a new video game.
* That means he spends $20 on the video game.
* He has $40 - $20 = $20 left.
* He then spends a quarter of the remaining $20 on a new book.
* That means he spends $20 x 0.25 = $5 on the book.
* He has $20 - $5 = $15 left.

Answer: $15
