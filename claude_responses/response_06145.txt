Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On a normal day, the machine can fill 1 barrel in 3 minutes
* With the leak, it takes 5 minutes to fill 1 barrel
* We need to find how much longer it will take to fill 12 barrels with the leak compared to a normal day

First, let's calculate how long it would take to fill 12 barrels on a normal day:
* 12 barrels x 3 minutes per barrel = 36 minutes

Now, let's calculate how long it would take to fill 12 barrels with the leak:
* 12 barrels x 5 minutes per barrel = 60 minutes

To find the difference, we subtract the normal time from the time with the leak:
* 60 minutes - 36 minutes = 24 minutes
