Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The psychiatrist has 4 patients in total
* The 4 patients need 25 sessions in total
* One patient needs 6 sessions
* Another patient needs 5 more sessions than the first patient, which is 6 + 5 = 11 sessions

Now, we need to find out how many sessions the remaining 2 patients need.

To do this, we can subtract the sessions needed by the first two patients from the total sessions needed:
* Total sessions needed: 25
* Sessions needed by first patient: 6
* Sessions needed by second patient: 11
* Sessions needed by the remaining 2 patients: 25 - 6 - 11 = 8

Therefore, the remaining 2 patients would need 8 sessions in total.

Answer: 8
