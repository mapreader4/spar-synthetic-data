Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carrie works for $8 an hour
* She works 35 hours a week
* She has been working there for 1 month (4 weeks)
* The bike she wants to buy costs $400

First, let's calculate how much Carrie has earned in the 1 month (4 weeks) she has been working:
* Hourly wage: $8
* Hours worked per week: 35
* Weeks worked: 4
* Total earnings = $8 x 35 x 4 = $1,120

Now, we can calculate how much money she will have left over after buying the $400 bike:
* Total earnings: $1,120
* Bike cost: $400
* Money left over = $1,120 - $400 = $720

Answer: $720
