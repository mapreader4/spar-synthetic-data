Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lisa walks 10 meters each minute
* She walks for an hour each day
* There are 60 minutes in an hour
* So, in one hour, Lisa walks 10 meters x 60 minutes = 600 meters
* She does this for two days
* Therefore, the total distance Lisa walks in two days is:
* 600 meters per day x 2 days = 1,200 meters

Answer: 1,200
