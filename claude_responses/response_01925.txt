Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tyson can swim at a speed of 3 miles per hour in a lake
* Tyson can swim at a speed of 2.5 miles per hour in an ocean
* This season, half his races happened in lakes and half his races happened in the ocean
* He had 10 total races, each of which was 3 miles long

To calculate the total time spent in his races, we need to find the time it took him to complete each race and then add them all up.

For the races in the lake:
* Speed in the lake = 3 miles per hour
* Distance of each race = 3 miles
* Time for each lake race = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 3 miles per hour = 1 hour

For the races in the ocean:
* Speed in the ocean = 2.5 miles per hour
* Distance of each race = 3 miles
* Time for each ocean race = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 2.5 miles per hour = 1.2 hours

Total time spent in all races:
* 5 races in the lake at 1 hour each = 5 hours
* 5 races in the ocean at 1.2 hours each = 6 hours
* Total time = 5 hours + 6 hours = 11 hours

Answer: 11 hours
