Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 20 bars of soap
2) Each bar of soap weighs 1.5 pounds
3) The cost per pound is $0.5
To calculate the total cost:
1) Total weight of the soap = 20 bars x 1.5 pounds per bar = 30 pounds
2) Cost per pound is $0.5
3) Total cost = 30 pounds x $0.5 per pound = $15
