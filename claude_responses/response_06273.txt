Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Stacy was 50 inches tall last year.
2) Her brother grew 1 inch last year.
3) Stacy grew 6 inches more than her brother.
4) So, if her brother grew 1 inch, Stacy grew 1 + 6 = 7 inches.
5) Therefore, Stacy's current height is 50 inches + 7 inches = 57 inches.

Answer: 57 inches.
