Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carrie drove 135 miles the first day
* She drove 124 miles more the second day, which means she drove 135 + 124 = 259 miles
* She drove 159 miles the third day
* She drove 189 miles the fourth day
* To calculate the total miles driven, we add up the miles for each day:
  - 135 + 259 + 159 + 189 = 742 miles
* We know that Carrie has to charge her phone every 106 miles
* To calculate how many times she had to charge her phone, we divide the total miles driven by 106:
  - 742 / 106 = 7 (with a remainder of 0)

Answer: 7
