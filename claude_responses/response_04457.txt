Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Matt can make a batch of a dozen (12) cookies using 2 pounds of flour.
2) Matt uses 4 bags of flour, each weighing 5 pounds.
3) So the total amount of flour used is 4 bags x 5 pounds per bag = 20 pounds of flour.
4) Since Matt can make a batch of 12 cookies using 2 pounds of flour, we can calculate how many batches he can make with 20 pounds of flour:
20 pounds of flour / 2 pounds of flour per batch = 10 batches
5) Each batch makes 12 cookies, so the total number of cookies Matt can make is:
10 batches x 12 cookies per batch = 120 cookies
6) Jim eats 15 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:
120 cookies - 15 cookies = 105 cookies

Answer: 105 cookies
