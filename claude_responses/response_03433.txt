Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first runner runs at an average pace of 8 minutes per mile
* The second runner runs at an average pace of 7 minutes per mile
* After 56 minutes, the second runner stops for a drink of water
* We need to find how many minutes the second runner could remain stopped before the first runner catches up with him

First, let's calculate how far each runner has gone in 56 minutes:
* First runner: 56 minutes / 8 minutes per mile = 7 miles
* Second runner: 56 minutes / 7 minutes per mile = 8 miles

So, the second runner has gone 1 mile further than the first runner.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take the first runner to catch up to the second runner, who is stopped.
* The first runner is running at 8 minutes per mile, so it would take him 8 minutes to cover the 1 mile distance.

Therefore, the second runner could remain stopped for 8 minutes before the first runner catches up with him.

Answer: 8 minutes
