Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tim starts with 22 cans of soda.
2) Jeff takes 6 cans from Tim, so Tim is left with 22 - 6 = 16 cans.
3) Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left, which is 16 / 2 = 8 more cans.
4) So the total number of cans Tim has in the end is 16 + 8 = 24 cans.

Answer: 24
