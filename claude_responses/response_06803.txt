Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kim spent $25,000 to open the store
* She makes $4,000 a month in revenue
* Her expenses are $1,500 a month
* To calculate the net profit per month, we take the revenue and subtract the expenses:
    - Net profit per month = $4,000 - $1,500 = $2,500
* To pay back the $25,000 cost to open the store, we divide the cost by the net profit per month:
    - Time to pay back the cost = $25,000 / $2,500 = 10 months
