Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Delta took 8 donuts
* Beta took three times as many donuts as Gamma
* The total number of donuts is 40

First, we need to find out how many donuts Beta took. Since Beta took three times as many as Gamma, we can represent this as:
* Beta's donuts = 3 * Gamma's donuts

Now, we know that the total number of donuts is 40, and Delta took 8 donuts. So the remaining donuts are:
* Remaining donuts = 40 - 8 = 32

We also know that Beta's donuts plus Gamma's donuts must equal the remaining 32 donuts. So we can set up an equation:
* Beta's donuts + Gamma's donuts = 32
* 3 * Gamma's donuts + Gamma's donuts = 32
* 4 * Gamma's donuts = 32
* Gamma's donuts = 32 / 4 = 8

Therefore, Gamma received 8 donuts.

Answer: 8
