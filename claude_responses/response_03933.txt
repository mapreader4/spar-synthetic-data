Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Burt spent $2.00 on a packet of basil seeds and $8.00 on potting soil, for a total of $10.00 in expenses.
2) The packet of seeds yielded 20 basil plants.
3) Burt sells each basil plant for $5.00.
4) To calculate the total revenue, we multiply the number of plants (20) by the price per plant ($5.00): 20 x $5.00 = $100.00.
5) To calculate the net profit, we take the total revenue ($100.00) and subtract the total expenses ($10.00): $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Answer: $90
