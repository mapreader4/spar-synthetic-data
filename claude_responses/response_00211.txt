Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Last year, Jessica's monthly expenses were:
* Rent: $1000
* Food: $200
* Car insurance: $100
* Total monthly expenses: $1000 + $200 + $100 = $1300

Last year's total annual expenses:
* $1300 per month x 12 months = $15,600

This year, Jessica's expenses have changed:
* Rent increased by 30%, so new rent is $1000 x 1.30 = $1300 per month
* Food costs increased by 50%, so new food cost is $200 x 1.50 = $300 per month
* Car insurance tripled, so new car insurance is $100 x 3 = $300 per month
* New total monthly expenses: $1300 + $300 + $300 = $1900

This year's total annual expenses:
* $1900 per month x 12 months = $22,800

Difference in annual expenses between this year and last year:
* $22,800 - $15,600 = $7,200

Answer: $7,200
