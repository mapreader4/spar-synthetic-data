Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 6 t-shirts
* Each t-shirt costs $20 originally
* The t-shirts are 50% off

To calculate the total cost:
* Each t-shirt is 50% off, so the discounted price is $20 * 0.5 = $10 per t-shirt
* With 6 t-shirts at $10 each, the total cost is 6 * $10 = $60

Answer: 60
