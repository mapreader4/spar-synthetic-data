Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Akeno spent $2985 to furnish his apartment.
2) Lev spent one-third of the amount Akeno spent, which is $2985 / 3 = $995.
3) Ambrocio spent $177 less than Lev, which is $995 - $177 = $818.
4) The total amount spent by Lev and Ambrocio is $995 + $818 = $1813.
5) Akeno spent $2985, while Lev and Ambrocio spent a combined $1813.
6) The difference between what Akeno spent and what Lev and Ambrocio spent is $2985 - $1813 = $1172.

Answer: $1172
