Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Jaco bought the following items:
   - Pair of shoes: $74
   - 2 pairs of socks: 2 x $2 = $4
   - Bag: $42

2. The total charge before the discount is:
   Total charge = $74 + $4 + $42 = $120

3. The discount is applied to the amount exceeding $100, which is $20 ($120 - $100).
   Discount = 10% of $20 = 0.1 x $20 = $2

4. The final amount Jaco will pay is the total charge minus the discount:
   Final amount = $120 - $2 = $118

Answer: $118
