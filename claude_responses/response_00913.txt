Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The trader made a profit of $960 after a week of sales.
2) To raise $610 for her next shipment of wares, she splits the profit in half. This means she has $480 (half of $960) to work with.
3) She then solicits donations from her family and friends, and receives a total donation of $310.
4) She adds the $310 donation to the $480 (half of her profit), which gives her a total of $790.
5) Her goal was to raise $610, so the amount of money she made above her goal is $790 - $610 = $180.

Answer: 180
