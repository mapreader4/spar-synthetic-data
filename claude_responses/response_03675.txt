Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* George wants to borrow $100 from a loan shark
* The finance fee starts at 5% and doubles every week
* George plans to borrow the money for 2 weeks

Week 1:
* The finance fee starts at 5% of $100, which is $5

Week 2:
* The finance fee doubles from the previous week, so it is now 10% of $100, which is $10

Total finance fees:
* Week 1 fee: $5
* Week 2 fee: $10
* Total finance fees = $5 + $10 = $15
