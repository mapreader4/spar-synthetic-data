Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Princess Daphne bought 3 necklaces and a set of earrings
* The total cost of the 3 necklaces and the earrings is $240,000
* All 3 necklaces were equal in price
* The earrings were 3 times as expensive as any one necklace

Let's call the cost of a single necklace 'x'.

Since all 3 necklaces were equal in price, the total cost of the 3 necklaces is 3x.

The earrings were 3 times as expensive as any one necklace, so the cost of the earrings is 3x.

Therefore, the total cost is:
3x + 3x = $240,000

Solving for x:
6x = $240,000
x = $40,000

Answer: $40,000
