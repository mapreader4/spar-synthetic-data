Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Artemis's mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses 1 ounce of tea.
2) This means the ratio of tea to cup size is 1:8.
3) For the party, each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea.
4) There are 12 people at the party.
5) To find the total amount of tea needed, we need to multiply the ratio of tea to cup size (1:8) by the number of people (12) and the cup size (6 ounces).
6) 1 ounce of tea per 8 ounces of cup size * 12 people * 6 ounces per cup = 9 ounces of tea.

Answer: 9 ounces
