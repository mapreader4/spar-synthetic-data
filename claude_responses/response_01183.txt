Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The zoo initially had 68 wild animals
* They sent a gorilla family of 6 to a different zoo, so now they have 68 - 6 = 62 animals
* They then adopted a hippopotamus, so now they have 62 + 1 = 63 animals
* They then took in 3 endangered rhinos, so now they have 63 + 3 = 66 animals
* One of their lionesses then gave birth to cubs
* They also opened a meerkat exhibit with twice as many meerkats as they had gained lion cubs
* In the end, they had a total of 90 animals

We need to find out how many lion cubs were born. Let's call the number of lion cubs "x".

After the lion cubs were born, the total number of animals was 90. We can express this as:
66 + x + 2x = 90

Solving for x, we get:
66 + 3x = 90
3x = 24
x = 8

Therefore, the number of lion cubs born at the zoo is 8.

Answer: 8
