Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Annie has three times more toys than Mike
2) Mike has 6 toys
3) Therefore, Annie has 3 x 6 = 18 toys
4) Annie has two less toys than Tom
5) So, Tom has 18 + 2 = 20 toys
6) The total number of toys for Annie, Mike, and Tom is:
   Annie: 18 toys
   Mike: 6 toys
   Tom: 20 toys
   Total: 18 + 6 + 20 = 44 toys

Answer: 44
