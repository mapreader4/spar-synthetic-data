Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sedrach has 13 apple pies
* Each apple pie can be divided into 2 halves
* So, 13 apple pies can be divided into 13 * 2 = 26 half-pies
* Each half-pie can be split into 5 bite-size samples
* So, 26 half-pies can be split into 26 * 5 = 130 bite-size samples

Therefore, the total number of people who can taste Sedrach's apple pies if he divides them all into bite-size samples is:

Answer: 130
