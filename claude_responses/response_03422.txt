Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 2 puzzles
* Each puzzle is 2000 pieces
* He can do 100 pieces every 10 minutes
* To find the total time to finish both puzzles, we need to:
1) Calculate the total number of pieces for both puzzles:
   * 2 puzzles x 2000 pieces per puzzle = 4000 total pieces
2) Calculate the time it takes to complete 4000 pieces at a rate of 100 pieces every 10 minutes:
   * 4000 pieces / 100 pieces per 10 minutes = 400 sets of 10 minutes
   * 400 sets of 10 minutes = 4000 minutes
3) Convert the total minutes to hours:
   * 4000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 66.67 hours

Answer: 67 hours
