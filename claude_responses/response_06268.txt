Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maryann spends seven times as long doing accounting as calling clients
* This means that for every 1 minute she spends calling clients, she spends 7 minutes doing accounting
* We know that she worked a total of 560 minutes today
* Let's say she spent x minutes calling clients
* Then she spent 7x minutes doing accounting
* The total time spent is x + 7x = 8x
* We know the total time is 560 minutes, so 8x = 560
* Solving for x, we get x = 70
* Therefore, Maryann spent 70 minutes calling clients.

Answer: 70
