Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emily bought art supplies for $20
* She also bought 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money
* The total amount she spent was $50

To find the cost of each skirt, we can set up an equation:
* Let x = the cost of each skirt
* Total cost = art supplies + (2 * cost of each skirt)
* $50 = $20 + (2 * x)
* $50 - $20 = 2 * x
* $30 = 2 * x
* x = $15

Therefore, Emily paid $15 for each of the skirts.
