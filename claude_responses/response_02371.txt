Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tommy can ride his bike 2 blocks north, 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and 2 blocks south.
2. This means the total area Tommy can ride in is a rectangle with a length of 5 blocks (3 blocks east - 2 blocks west) and a width of 4 blocks (2 blocks north - 2 blocks south).
3. The area of the rectangle Tommy can ride in is 5 blocks x 4 blocks = 20 square blocks.
4. Tommy's friend can ride his bike in an area of 80 square blocks.
5. To find how many times greater the area his friend can ride in is compared to Tommy, we divide the friend's area by Tommy's area:
80 square blocks / 20 square blocks = 4

Answer: 4
