Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marianne was 20 years old when Bella was 8 years old.
* We need to find out how old Marianne will be when Bella turns 18.
* The difference between Bella's age when Marianne was 20 and when Bella turns 18 is 10 years (18 - 8 = 10).
* Therefore, Marianne will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old when Bella turns 18.
