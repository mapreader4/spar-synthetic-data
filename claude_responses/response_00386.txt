Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Shoes:
   - Original price of 2 pairs of shoes: 2 x $50 = $100
   - Discount on shoes: 40% off
   - Discounted price of shoes: $100 - (40% of $100) = $100 - $40 = $60

2. Dress:
   - Original price of the dress: $100
   - Discount on the dress: 20% off
   - Discounted price of the dress: $100 - (20% of $100) = $100 - $20 = $80

3. Total amount spent:
   - Cost of shoes: $60
   - Cost of dress: $80
   - Total amount spent: $60 + $80 = $140

Answer: $140
