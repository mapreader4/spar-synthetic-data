Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James starts with a collection of 500 Legos
* He uses half of the 500 Legos to build a castle
* So, he uses 500 / 2 = 250 Legos to build the castle
* He is then told to put the rest of the Legos back in the box
* The number of Legos he has left is 500 - 250 = 250 Legos
* However, he is missing 5 Legos that he couldn't find
* Therefore, the number of Legos in the box at the end is 250 - 5 = 245 Legos

Answer: 245
