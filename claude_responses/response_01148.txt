Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 480 grains of rice in one cup.
2) We also know that half a cup is 8 tablespoons.
3) And we know that one tablespoon is 3 teaspoons.
4) So, if half a cup is 8 tablespoons, and each tablespoon is 3 teaspoons, then half a cup is 8 x 3 = 24 teaspoons.
5) Since there are 480 grains of rice in one cup, and half a cup is 24 teaspoons, then there must be 480 / 24 = 20 grains of rice in each teaspoon.

Answer: 20 grains of rice in a teaspoon.
