Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bookstore is offering 30% off any book that is over $22.00 and 20% off any book under $20.00.
2) The books Gordon bought have the following prices: $25.00, $18.00, $21.00, $35.00, $12.00, and $10.00.
3) For the books over $22.00:
   - $25.00 book: 30% off, so the price is $25.00 - (0.30 * $25.00) = $17.50
   - $35.00 book: 30% off, so the price is $35.00 - (0.30 * $35.00) = $24.50
4) For the books under $20.00:
   - $18.00 book: 20% off, so the price is $18.00 - (0.20 * $18.00) = $14.40
   - $12.00 book: 20% off, so the price is $12.00 - (0.20 * $12.00) = $9.60
   - $10.00 book: 20% off, so the price is $10.00 - (0.20 * $10.00) = $8.00
5) The $21.00 book is not discounted.
6) Adding up all the discounted prices:
   - $17.50 + $14.40 + $24.50 + $9.60 + $8.00 + $21.00 = $95.00
