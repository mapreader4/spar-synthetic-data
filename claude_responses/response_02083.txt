Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys pistachios for $10 per can
* Each can is 5 ounces
* He eats 30 ounces of pistachios every 5 days

First, we need to find out how many cans he needs to buy every 5 days:
* 30 ounces / 5 ounces per can = 6 cans every 5 days

Next, we need to find out how much he spends on pistachios every 5 days:
* 6 cans x $10 per can = $60 every 5 days

Finally, to find out how much he spends on pistachios per week, we divide the amount spent every 5 days by 5 and multiply by 7:
* $60 / 5 days x 7 days = $84 per week

Answer: 84
