Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Elida has 5 letters
2) Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has
   - Twice the number of letters Elida has is 2 * 5 = 10
   - 2 less than 10 is 8
   - Therefore, Adrianna has 8 letters
3) The average number of letters in both names is (5 + 8) / 2 = 6.5
4) 10 times the average number of letters in both names is 10 * 6.5 = 65.

Answer: 65
