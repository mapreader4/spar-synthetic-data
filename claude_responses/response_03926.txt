Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Fred originally had 212 sheets of paper.
2) He then received 307 more sheets of paper from Jane.
3) So the total number of sheets of paper Fred had after receiving the additional 307 sheets is:
212 + 307 = 519 sheets of paper.
4) Fred then gave 156 sheets of paper to Charles.
5) So the number of sheets of paper Fred has left is:
519 - 156 = 363 sheets of paper.

Answer: 363
