Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Howard has a collection of 70 wooden bowls
* He rewards 2 bowls to his customers for every 10 bowls they buy
* He had 20 customers that day
* Half of the customers (10) bought 20 bowls each

First, let's calculate the total number of bowls bought by the customers:
* 10 customers bought 20 bowls each, so that's 10 * 20 = 200 bowls

Next, let's calculate the number of bowls rewarded to the customers:
* For every 10 bowls bought, the customer receives 2 bowls as a reward
* So for 200 bowls bought, the customers received 200 / 10 * 2 = 40 bowls as rewards

Finally, to find the number of bowls remaining in the rewards collection, we take the original 70 bowls and subtract the 40 bowls that were rewarded:
* 70 - 40 = 30 bowls remaining

Answer: 30
