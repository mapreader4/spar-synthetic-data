Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Keenan needs to write an essay that is 1200 words
* She writes 400 words per hour for the first two hours
* After that, she writes 200 words per hour
* The essay is due at midnight

First, let's calculate how many words she can write in the first two hours:
* 2 hours x 400 words/hour = 800 words

Now, we need to calculate how many words she has left to write:
* 1200 words - 800 words = 400 words

Next, we need to calculate how long it will take her to write the remaining 400 words at 200 words per hour:
* 400 words / 200 words/hour = 2 hours

Therefore, Keenan needs to start 2 hours before the deadline to finish the essay on time.
