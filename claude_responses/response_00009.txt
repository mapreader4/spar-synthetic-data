Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tina's hourly wage is $18.00.
2) She works 10 hours per day, and she works for 5 days.
3) For the first 8 hours of each day, she is paid her regular hourly wage of $18.00.
4) For the remaining 2 hours of each day, she is eligible for overtime pay, which is her hourly wage ($18.00) plus 1/2 of her hourly wage ($9.00), which is $27.00 per hour.
5) For the first 8 hours of each day, she earns $18.00 x 8 = $144.00.
6) For the remaining 2 hours of each day, she earns $27.00 x 2 = $54.00.
7) So for each day, she earns $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00.
8) For 5 days, she earns $198.00 x 5 = $990.00.

Answer: $990
