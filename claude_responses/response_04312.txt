Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sean needs to replace:
  - 2 light bulbs in the bedroom
  - 1 light bulb in the bathroom
  - 1 light bulb in the kitchen
  - 4 light bulbs in the basement
* That's a total of 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8 light bulbs
* He also needs to replace 1/2 of that amount in the garage
* 1/2 of 8 is 4 light bulbs
* So the total number of light bulbs he needs to replace is 8 + 4 = 12 light bulbs
* The light bulbs come in packs of 2
* To calculate the number of packs he needs, we divide the total number of light bulbs (12) by the number of bulbs per pack (2)
* 12 / 2 = 6
