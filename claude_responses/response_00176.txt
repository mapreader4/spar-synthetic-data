Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The store sells 20 packets of sugar every week.
2) Each packet contains 100 grams of sugar.
3) To find the total amount of sugar sold in grams, we multiply the number of packets (20) by the amount in each packet (100 grams):
20 packets x 100 grams/packet = 2,000 grams of sugar sold per week.
4) To convert grams to kilograms, we divide the total grams by 1,000 (since 1 kilogram = 1,000 grams):
2,000 grams / 1,000 grams/kilogram = 2 kilograms of sugar sold per week.

Answer: 2 kilograms
