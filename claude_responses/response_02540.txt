Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rosie purchased the art piece for $4000 three years ago.
* The art piece will be three times as much in another three years.
* To find the increase in value, we need to calculate the difference between the future value and the original purchase price.

First, let's find the future value of the art piece in three years:
* The art piece will be three times as much in three years.
* So, the future value of the art piece = $4000 x 3 = $12,000.

Now, to find the increase in value:
* Increase in value = Future value - Original purchase price
* Increase in value = $12,000 - $4,000 = $8,000

Answer: $8,000
