Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original size of the drawing is 9 by 13 inches.
2) A black and white drawing of that size would cost $160.
3) John wants a color drawing, which is 50% more expensive than the black and white version.
4) To calculate the cost of the color drawing, we need to find 50% of the original $160 cost.
5) 50% of $160 is $80.
6) So the color drawing would cost $160 + $80 = $240.

Answer: $240
