Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each glass of chocolate milk requires 6.5 ounces of milk and 1.5 ounces of chocolate syrup
* So each glass of chocolate milk requires a total of 8 ounces (6.5 ounces of milk + 1.5 ounces of chocolate syrup)
* Charles has 130 ounces of milk and 60 ounces of chocolate syrup
* To determine the limiting ingredient, we need to calculate how many glasses he can make with each:
* With 130 ounces of milk, he can make 130 / 6.5 = 20 glasses
* With 60 ounces of chocolate syrup, he can make 60 / 1.5 = 40 glasses
* The limiting ingredient is the milk, so he can make 20 glasses of chocolate milk
* Each glass is 8 ounces, so the total ounces of chocolate milk he will drink is:
* 20 glasses x 8 ounces per glass = 160 ounces

Answer: 160
