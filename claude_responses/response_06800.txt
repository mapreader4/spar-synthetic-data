Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Autumn started with 20 pencils
* In the first month of school:
  - She misplaced 7 pencils
  - She broke 3 pencils and had to throw them away
  - She found 4 pencils
  - She bought 2 more pencils
* To calculate the number of pencils she has left:
  - She started with 20 pencils
  - She lost 7 + 3 = 10 pencils
  - She found 4 pencils
  - She bought 2 more pencils
  - So the total number of pencils she has left is:
    20 - 10 + 4 + 2 = 16

Answer: 16
