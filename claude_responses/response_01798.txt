Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John's initial bench press was 500 pounds.
2) After the injury, his bench press went down by 80%. This means he could only bench 20% of his original 500 pounds, which is 100 pounds.
3) After some training, he managed to triple the weight he could bench. This means he went from 100 pounds to 3 times that, which is 300 pounds.
4) Therefore, his current bench press is 300 pounds.

Answer: 300
