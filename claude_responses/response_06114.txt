Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nancy has 6 pairs of boots, which means she has 6 x 2 = 12 individual boots.
2) She has 9 more pairs of slippers than boots, so she has 6 + 9 = 15 pairs of slippers, which is 15 x 2 = 30 individual slippers.
3) The number of pairs of heels is equal to three times the combined number of slippers and boots. The combined number of slippers and boots is 12 + 30 = 42. Three times 42 is 126, so she has 126 individual heels.
4) Adding up the individual boots, slippers, and heels, we get:
12 + 30 + 126 = 168 individual shoes.

Answer: 168
