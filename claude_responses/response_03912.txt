Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Quincy bought a car using a 5 year loan with no interest.
2) He put $5,000.00 down as a down payment.
3) His monthly payment is $250.00.
4) To find the total price of the car, we need to calculate the total amount he will pay over the 5 year loan period.
5) The total amount he will pay over 5 years is 5 * 12 * $250.00 = $15,000.00.
6) Adding the $5,000.00 down payment to the $15,000.00 total loan amount gives us the total price of the car.
Answer: $20,000.00
