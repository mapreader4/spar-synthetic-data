Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Andy started with a platter of chocolate cookies
* He ate 3 of them
* He then gave 5 to his little brother
* He then handed the platter to his basketball team of 8 members
* The first player took 1 cookie
* The second player took 3 cookies
* The third player took 5 cookies
* And so on, with each subsequent player taking 2 more cookies than the previous player
* When the last player took his share, the platter was empty

To find the total number of cookies Andy started with, we need to add up all the cookies that were taken:
* Andy ate 3 cookies
* He gave 5 cookies to his little brother
* The 8 players on the basketball team took:
  - Player 1: 1 cookie
  - Player 2: 3 cookies
  - Player 3: 5 cookies
  - Player 4: 7 cookies
  - Player 5: 9 cookies
  - Player 6: 11 cookies
  - Player 7: 13 cookies
  - Player 8: 15 cookies
* Adding these up, we get:
  - 3 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 15 = 59 cookies

Answer: 59
