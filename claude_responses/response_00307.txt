Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 110 calories in a serving of cheese.
2) Rick buys the large blocks that have 16 servings per block.
3) Rick has already eaten 5 servings of cheese.
4) To calculate the remaining calories in the block, we first need to calculate the total calories in the block:
   - 16 servings per block x 110 calories per serving = 1760 total calories per block
5) Now, we need to subtract the calories that Rick has already eaten:
   - 5 servings eaten x 110 calories per serving = 550 calories eaten
6) To find the remaining calories, we subtract the calories eaten from the total calories in the block:
   - 1760 total calories - 550 calories eaten = 1210 remaining calories

Answer: 1210
