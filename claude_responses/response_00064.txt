Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James earns $20 per hour at his main job.
2) He works 30 hours per week at his main job.
3) So, his earnings from his main job per week are:
   $20 per hour x 30 hours per week = $600 per week.
4) At his second job, he earns 20% less than his main job.
   That means he earns $20 x (1 - 0.2) = $16 per hour.
5) He works half the hours at his second job as he does at his main job, which is 15 hours per week.
6) So, his earnings from his second job per week are:
   $16 per hour x 15 hours per week = $240 per week.
7) His total earnings per week are the sum of his earnings from both jobs:
   $600 per week + $240 per week = $840 per week.

Answer: $840
