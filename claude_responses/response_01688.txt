Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Elijah drank 8.5 pints of coffee yesterday.
2) Emilio drank 9.5 pints of water yesterday.
3) To find the total number of cups of liquid the two boys drank, we need to convert the pints to cups.
4) 1 pint = 2 cups
5) Elijah drank 8.5 pints, which is 8.5 * 2 = 17 cups of coffee.
6) Emilio drank 9.5 pints, which is 9.5 * 2 = 19 cups of water.
7) The total number of cups of liquid the two boys drank is 17 + 19 = 36 cups.

Answer: 36
