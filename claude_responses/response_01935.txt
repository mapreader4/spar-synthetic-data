Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Reese had a sum of money in her savings account.
2) In February, she spent 20% of her savings.
3) In March, she spent 40% of her savings.
4) In April, she spent $1500.
5) After these expenses, she still has $2900 in her savings account.

Let's call the original amount in her savings account 'x'.

In February, she spent 20% of x, which is 0.2x.
In March, she spent 40% of x, which is 0.4x.
In April, she spent $1500.

After these expenses, she has $2900 left.

So we can write the equation:
x - 0.2x - 0.4x - 1500 = 2900

Simplifying:
0.4x - 1500 = 2900
0.4x = 4400
x = 11000

Therefore, the original amount Reese had in her savings account was $11,000.

Answer: 11000
