Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first hive has 1000 bees and produces 500 liters of honey.
2. The second hive has 20% fewer bees than the first hive.
   - 20% of 1000 is 200.
   - So the second hive has 1000 - 200 = 800 bees.
3. Each bee in the second hive produces 40% more honey than the bees in the first hive.
   - If each bee in the first hive produces 0.5 liters of honey (500 liters / 1000 bees), then each bee in the second hive produces 0.5 * 1.4 = 0.7 liters of honey.
4. To calculate the total honey produced:
   - First hive: 1000 bees x 0.5 liters/bee = 500 liters
   - Second hive: 800 bees x 0.7 liters/bee = 560 liters
   - Total honey produced = 500 + 560 = 1060 liters

Answer: 1060 liters
