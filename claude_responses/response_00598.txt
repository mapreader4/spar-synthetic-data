Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Federal guidelines recommend eating at least 2 cups of vegetables per day.
* Sarah has eaten 8 cups of vegetables from Sunday breakfast to Thursday evening.
* We need to find how many cups per day Sarah needs to eat to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week.

To calculate this, we first need to determine the total number of days in the given time period:
* Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday = 5 days

Now, we can calculate the total minimum requirement for the week:
* 2 cups per day x 5 days = 10 cups

Since Sarah has already eaten 8 cups, we can subtract that from the total minimum requirement to find how many more cups she needs to eat:
* 10 cups - 8 cups = 2 cups

Finally, to find how many cups per day Sarah needs to eat, we divide the remaining 2 cups by the number of days left in the week:
* 2 cups / 2 days = 1 cup per day

Answer: 1 cup
