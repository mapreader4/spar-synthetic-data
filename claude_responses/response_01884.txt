Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The sandbag has a capacity of 250 pounds.
2) The bag is filled 80% full, so the actual weight of the contents is 80% of 250 pounds, which is 0.8 * 250 = 200 pounds.
3) However, the filling material is 40% heavier than sand, so we need to adjust the weight accordingly.
4) If the filling material is 40% heavier than sand, that means it is 1.4 times the weight of sand.
5) Therefore, the actual weight of the contents in the bag is 1.4 * 200 = 280 pounds.
Answer: 280 pounds
