Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Mother made 2 dozen brownies, which is 24 brownies.
* Father ate 8 of the brownies.
* Mooney ate 4 of the brownies.
* So, the number of brownies remaining from the first batch is 24 - 8 - 4 = 12 brownies.
* The next day, Mother made another 2 dozen brownies, which is 24 more brownies.
* So, the total number of brownies on the counter is the 12 remaining from the first batch plus the 24 from the second batch, which is 12 + 24 = 36 brownies.

Answer: 36
