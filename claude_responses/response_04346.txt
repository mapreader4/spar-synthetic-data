Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Julio has 4 bottles of orange soda and 7 bottles of grape soda
* Mateo has 1 bottle of orange soda and 3 bottles of grape soda
* Each bottle contains 2 liters of soda

First, let's calculate the total amount of soda that Julio has:
* 4 bottles of orange soda x 2 liters per bottle = 8 liters of orange soda
* 7 bottles of grape soda x 2 liters per bottle = 14 liters of grape soda
* Total soda for Julio = 8 liters + 14 liters = 22 liters

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soda that Mateo has:
* 1 bottle of orange soda x 2 liters per bottle = 2 liters of orange soda
* 3 bottles of grape soda x 2 liters per bottle = 6 liters of grape soda
* Total soda for Mateo = 2 liters + 6 liters = 8 liters

Finally, to find the difference in soda between Julio and Mateo, we subtract Mateo's total from Julio's total:
* 22 liters - 8 liters = 14 liters
