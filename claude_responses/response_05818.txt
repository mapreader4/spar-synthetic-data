Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tommy has 10 more dimes than pennies. Let's say he has x pennies. Then he has x + 10 dimes.
2) He has twice as many nickels as dimes. So he has 2(x + 10) nickels.
3) He has 4 quarters.
4) He has 10 times as many pennies as quarters. So he has 10(4) = 40 pennies.
5) Now we can solve for x:
   x = 40 pennies
   x + 10 = 50 dimes
   2(x + 10) = 100 nickels
Answer: 100 nickels.
