Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The total cost of the pen and pencil is $6.
2) The pen costs twice as much as the pencil.
3) Let's call the cost of the pencil 'x'.
4) Since the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, the cost of the pen is '2x'.
5) The total cost of the pen and pencil is $6, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x = 6
6) Solving for x, we get:
3x = 6
x = 2
7) Since the cost of the pencil is 'x', and x = 2, the cost of the pencil is $2.
8) Since the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, the cost of the pen is 2 * $2 = $4.
