Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pete has a bag with 10 marbles total.
2) 40% of the marbles are blue, and the rest are red.
3) To find the number of blue marbles, we take 40% of 10 marbles:
   * 40% of 10 = 0.4 * 10 = 4 blue marbles
4) The remaining marbles must be red, so there are 10 - 4 = 6 red marbles.
5) Pete's friend will trade him 2 blue marbles for every 1 red marble.
6) Pete keeps 1 red marble, so he trades the remaining 5 red marbles.
7) For each of the 5 red marbles, Pete gets 2 blue marbles in return.
8) So Pete gets 5 * 2 = 10 blue marbles in the trade.
9) After the trade, Pete has the 4 blue marbles he started with, plus the 10 blue marbles he got in the trade, plus the 1 red marble he kept.
10) In total, Pete has 4 + 10 + 1 = 15 marbles.
