Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maria goes to the coffee shop 2 times a day
* Each time she goes, she orders 3 cups of coffee
* To find the total number of cups of coffee she orders per day, we need to multiply the number of times she goes to the coffee shop (2) by the number of cups of coffee she orders each time (3)

2 times a day x 3 cups of coffee per visit = 6 cups of coffee per day
