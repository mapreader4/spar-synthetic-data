Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The first spacecraft left New Orleans at 3:00 pm and landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, so it took 0.5 hours to travel the 448-mile distance.
2) The speed of the first spacecraft is therefore 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.
3) The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes after the first spacecraft, so it took 0.75 hours to travel the 448-mile distance.
4) The speed of the second spacecraft is therefore 448 miles / 0.75 hours = 597.33 miles per hour.
5) The difference in speed between the two spacecraft is 896 miles per hour - 597.33 miles per hour = 298.67 miles per hour.

Answer: 299 miles per hour.
