Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hannah needs 3 cups of flour for every 1 cup of banana mush.
2) It takes 4 bananas to make 1 cup of mush.
3) Hannah is using 20 bananas.
4) To calculate the number of cups of mush, we divide the number of bananas (20) by the number of bananas per cup of mush (4):
20 bananas / 4 bananas per cup = 5 cups of mush
5) Since Hannah needs 3 cups of flour for every 1 cup of mush, we multiply the number of cups of mush (5) by 3 to get the total cups of flour needed:
5 cups of mush x 3 cups of flour per cup of mush = 15 cups of flour
