Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 248 pages in the book
* Joanna can read 16 pages per hour
* On Monday, she reads for 3 hours
* On Tuesday, she reads for 6.5 hours

First, let's calculate how many pages she read on Monday:
* 3 hours x 16 pages/hour = 48 pages

Next, let's calculate how many pages she read on Tuesday:
* 6.5 hours x 16 pages/hour = 104 pages

Now, let's add up the total number of pages she has read so far:
* 48 pages + 104 pages = 152 pages

Finally, let's calculate how many more pages she needs to read to finish the book:
* 248 pages - 152 pages = 96 pages

Now, to calculate how many more hours she needs to read to finish the book, we divide the remaining pages by her reading speed:
* 96 pages / 16 pages/hour = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
