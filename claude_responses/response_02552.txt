Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy. This means that if Ivy has x dolls, then Dina has 2x dolls.
2) 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions. This means that 1/3 of Ivy's dolls are not collectors editions.
3) We are told that Ivy has 20 collectors edition dolls. This means that 1/3 of Ivy's dolls are 20, so Ivy has a total of 60 dolls (20 / (1/3) = 60).
4) Since Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy, and Ivy has 60 dolls, Dina has 2 * 60 = 120 dolls.

Answer: 120
