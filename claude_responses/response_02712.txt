Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Caprice takes one lesson per week
* Each lesson lasts 1 hour
* The teacher charges $10 for every half-hour of teaching
* We want to know how much the teacher would earn in 5 weeks

First, let's calculate the cost per lesson:
* Since each lesson lasts 1 hour, that's 2 half-hour sessions
* The teacher charges $10 per half-hour
* So the cost per lesson is 2 x $10 = $20

Now, let's calculate the total amount the teacher would earn in 5 weeks:
* Caprice takes 1 lesson per week
* In 5 weeks, that's 5 lessons
* Each lesson costs $20
* So the total amount the teacher would earn in 5 weeks is 5 x $20 = $100

Answer: $100
