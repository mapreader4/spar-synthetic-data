Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Starship Conundrum traveled from Planet X to Planet Y.
* The distance between these two planets is 4,000 parsecs.
* The travel time was eight hours less than twice the number of hours in a typical earth day.
* To find the average speed, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken.

First, let's find the time taken for the voyage:
* A typical earth day has 24 hours.
* Twice the number of hours in a typical earth day is 2 * 24 = 48 hours.
* The travel time was 8 hours less than 48 hours, so the travel time was 48 - 8 = 40 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
* Distance traveled = 4,000 parsecs
* Time taken = 40 hours
* Average speed = Distance / Time = 4,000 parsecs / 40 hours = 100 parsecs per hour

Answer: 100 parsecs per hour
