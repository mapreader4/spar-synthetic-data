Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Karen and Donald have 6 children, so there are 8 people in their family.
2) Tom and Eva have 4 children, so there are 6 people in their family.
3) In total, there are 8 + 6 = 14 people.
4) There are 16 legs in the pool, which means there are 8 people in the pool (since each person has 2 legs).
5) Therefore, the number of people not in the pool is 14 - 8 = 6.

Answer: 6
