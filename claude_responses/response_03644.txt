Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Malcolm has 240 followers on Instagram and 500 followers on Facebook.
2. The number of followers he has on Twitter is half the number of followers he has on Instagram and Facebook combined.
   * The number of followers on Instagram and Facebook combined is 240 + 500 = 740.
   * Half of 740 is 370, so the number of followers he has on Twitter is 370.
3. The number of followers he has on TikTok is 3 times the number of followers he has on Twitter.
   * The number of followers he has on Twitter is 370.
   * 3 times 370 is 1110, so the number of followers he has on TikTok is 1110.
4. The number of followers he has on Youtube is 510 more than the number of followers he has on TikTok.
   * The number of followers he has on TikTok is 1110.
   * 510 more than 1110 is 1620, so the number of followers he has on Youtube is 1620.

Now, to find the total number of followers Malcolm has on all his social media, we add up the followers from each platform:
* Instagram: 240
* Facebook: 500
* Twitter: 370
* TikTok: 1110
* Youtube: 1620

Answer: 3840
