Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jame's old job:
   - Hourly rate: $16 per hour
   - Hours per week: 25 hours
   - Yearly income = $16 x 25 hours x 52 weeks = $20,800

2. Jame's new job:
   - Hourly rate: $20 per hour
   - Hours per week: 40 hours
   - Yearly income = $20 x 40 hours x 52 weeks = $41,600

3. Difference in yearly income:
   - Yearly income in new job - Yearly income in old job
   - $41,600 - $20,800 = $20,800

Therefore, the amount of more money Jame makes per year in his new job compared to his old job is:

Answer: $20,800
