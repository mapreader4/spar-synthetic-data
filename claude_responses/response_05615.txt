Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* At the beginning of the day, Kevin has 15 phones that need to be repaired.
* By the afternoon, Kevin has successfully repaired 3 of the 15 phones.
* A client has dropped off 6 more phones that need fixing.
* So, the total number of phones that need to be repaired is:
   - Initial 15 phones
   - Minus 3 phones repaired
   - Plus 6 new phones dropped off
   - Total = 15 - 3 + 6 = 18 phones
* A coworker offers to help and fix half of the damaged phones.
* To find how many phones each person needs to repair, we divide the total number of phones by 2:
   - 18 phones / 2 = 9 phones each
