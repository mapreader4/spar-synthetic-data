Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lee had $10 and his friend had $8, so they had a total of $18 to start with.
2) They ordered:
- Chicken wings for $6
- Chicken salad for $4
- 2 sodas for $1.00 each, so $2 total
3) The total cost of the food and drinks is $6 + $4 + $2 = $12.
4) They also had to pay $3 in tax.
5) The total amount they spent is $12 + $3 = $15.
6) They started with $18, and spent $15, so the change they should have received is $18 - $15 = $3.
