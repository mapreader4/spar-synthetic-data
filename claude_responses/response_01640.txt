Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Taquon, Mack, and Jafari put their candy together and had a total of 418 pieces of candy
* Taquon had 171 pieces of candy
* Mack had 171 pieces of candy
* To find how many pieces of candy Jafari had, we need to subtract the total of Taquon's and Mack's candy from the total amount of candy
* Taquon's candy: 171 pieces
* Mack's candy: 171 pieces
* Total of Taquon's and Mack's candy: 171 + 171 = 342 pieces
* Total amount of candy: 418 pieces
* To find Jafari's candy, we subtract Taquon's and Mack's candy from the total:
* 418 - 342 = 76 pieces

Answer: 76
