Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister.
2) Rene's sister has two more dolls than their grandmother.
3) Their grandmother has 50 dolls.
4) So, Rene's sister has 50 + 2 = 52 dolls.
5) Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, so Rene has 3 * 52 = 156 dolls.
6) In total, they have 50 + 52 + 156 = 258 dolls.
