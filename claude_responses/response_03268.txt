Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Romeo buys 5 bars of chocolate at $5 each, so the total cost of the chocolates is:
   5 bars x $5 per bar = $25
2) Romeo sells all 5 bars of chocolate for a total of $90
3) The cost of the packaging material is $2 per bar, so the total cost of the packaging is:
   5 bars x $2 per bar = $10
4) To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total cost (chocolates + packaging) from the total sales:
   Total sales: $90
   Total cost: $25 (chocolates) + $10 (packaging) = $35
   Profit: $90 - $35 = $55

Answer: $55
