Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In 10 years, you will be twice your brother's age
* The sum of your ages in 10 years will be 45 years old
* Let's call your current age 'x' and your brother's current age 'y'
* In 10 years, your age will be x + 10, and your brother's age will be y + 10
* We know that in 10 years, your age will be twice your brother's age, so:
    x + 10 = 2(y + 10)
    x + 10 = 2y + 20
    x - 2y = 10
* We also know that the sum of your ages in 10 years will be 45, so:
    (x + 10) + (y + 10) = 45
    x + y + 20 = 45
    x + y = 25
* Substituting this into the first equation:
    x - 2(25 - x) = 10
    x - 50 + 2x = 10
    3x = 60
    x = 20
* Therefore, your current age is 20.

Answer: 20
