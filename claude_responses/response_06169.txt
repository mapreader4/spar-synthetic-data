Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tomas can run 3 miles during the first month of training
* Each month, he can run twice as far as the month before
* The marathon is 26.3 miles

So, let's calculate the distance he can run each month:
* Month 1: 3 miles
* Month 2: 3 x 2 = 6 miles
* Month 3: 6 x 2 = 12 miles
* Month 4: 12 x 2 = 24 miles

We can see that by the 4th month, he can run 24 miles, which is close to the 26.3 miles required for the marathon.

To ensure he can run far enough, he should start training 4 months before the marathon.
