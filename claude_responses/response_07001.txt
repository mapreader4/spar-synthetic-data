Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Andrew bought a bag of balloons that had 303 blue balloons and 453 purple balloons.
2) To find the total number of balloons, we add the blue and purple balloons together:
   303 blue balloons + 453 purple balloons = 756 total balloons
3) Andrew decides to share half of his balloons with his brother.
4) To find how many balloons Andrew has left, we divide the total number of balloons by 2:
   756 total balloons / 2 = 378 balloons

Answer: 378
