Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The total amount to be shared is $50.
2) Moses will take 40% of the total amount, which is 0.4 * $50 = $20.
3) The remaining amount is $50 - $20 = $30.
4) Tony and Esther will split the remaining $30 equally, so each of them will get $15.
5) The difference between what Moses gets ($20) and what Esther gets ($15) is $20 - $15 = $5.

Answer: $5.
