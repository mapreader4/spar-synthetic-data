Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harrison Elementary School has 1590 students
* 40% of the students are going to move to a new school
* 40% of 1590 is 0.4 * 1590 = 636 students
* There are 3 grade levels at the new school
* Each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class
* The remaining students in each grade level are divided evenly into 6 additional classes

First, let's calculate the number of students in the advanced classes:
* 3 grade levels, each with 1 advanced class of 20 students
* 3 * 20 = 60 students in advanced classes

Now, let's calculate the number of students in the normal classes:
* Total students moving to the new school: 636
* Students in advanced classes: 60
* Remaining students for normal classes: 636 - 60 = 576
* Number of normal classes per grade level: 6
* Number of grade levels: 3
* Total number of normal classes: 3 * 6 = 18
* Number of students per normal class: 576 / 18 = 32

Answer: 32 students per normal class.
