Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's old toilet used 5 gallons of water per flush.
2. His household flushed the toilet 15 times per day.
3. So the old toilet used 5 gallons x 15 flushes = 75 gallons of water per day.
4. John replaced the toilet with a new one that uses 80% less water per flush.
5. 80% less water per flush means the new toilet uses 20% of the water of the old toilet.
6. 20% of 5 gallons is 1 gallon per flush.
7. With 1 gallon per flush and 15 flushes per day, the new toilet uses 15 gallons of water per day.
8. In June, there are 30 days.
9. The old toilet used 75 gallons per day, so in June it used 75 gallons x 30 days = 2,250 gallons.
10. The new toilet uses 15 gallons per day, so in June it used 15 gallons x 30 days = 450 gallons.
11. The amount of water saved is the difference between the old and new toilet usage: 2,250 gallons - 450 gallons = 1,800 gallons.

Answer: 1,800 gallons
