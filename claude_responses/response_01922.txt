Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Stormi washes 3 cars for $10 each, so her total earnings from car washing is:
3 cars x $10 per car = $30

2) Stormi mows 2 lawns for $13 each, so her total earnings from lawn mowing is:
2 lawns x $13 per lawn = $26

3) The total amount of money Stormi has earned is the sum of her car washing and lawn mowing earnings:
$30 + $26 = $56

4) The bicycle she wants costs $80.
5) To calculate how much more money Stormi needs, we subtract the amount she has earned ($56) from the cost of the bicycle ($80):
$80 - $56 = $24

Answer: $24
