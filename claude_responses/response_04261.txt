Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 30 students in Ms. Leech's class.
2) Twice as many girls as boys are in the class. This means there are 20 girls and 10 boys.
3) Each boy brought 5 cups, so the total number of cups brought by the boys is 10 boys x 5 cups = 50 cups.
4) The total number of cups brought by all the students is 90.
5) To find the number of cups brought by the girls, we subtract the number of cups brought by the boys from the total number of cups:
90 cups - 50 cups = 40 cups.
6) Since there are 20 girls, each girl must have brought 40 cups / 20 girls = 2 cups.
