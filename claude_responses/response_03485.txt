Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maria had $760 at the beginning of the trip.
2) She paid $300 for the ticket.
3) She paid half of $300 for the hotel, which is $150.
4) To calculate the amount of money she has left, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she had at the beginning.
5) The total amount she spent is $300 (ticket) + $150 (hotel) = $450.
6) $760 (beginning amount) - $450 (total spent) = $310.

Answer: 310
