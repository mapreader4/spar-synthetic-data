Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cheryl needs 4 cups of basil to make 1 cup of pesto
* She can harvest 16 cups of basil from her farm every week
* She can do this for 8 weeks

First, we need to calculate the total amount of basil she can harvest over the 8 weeks:
* 16 cups of basil per week x 8 weeks = 128 cups of basil

Now, we need to figure out how many cups of pesto she can make with 128 cups of basil.
* 1 cup of pesto requires 4 cups of basil
* 128 cups of basil / 4 cups of basil per cup of pesto = 32 cups of pesto

Therefore, Cheryl will be able to make 32 cups of pesto.

Answer: 32
