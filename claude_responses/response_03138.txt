Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Milo gets 3 grades of 2, 4 grades of 3, 1 grade of 4, and 1 grade of 5
* To calculate the average grade, we need to add up all the grades and divide by the total number of grades
* 3 grades of 2 = 6
* 4 grades of 3 = 12
* 1 grade of 4 = 4
* 1 grade of 5 = 5
* Total of all grades = 6 + 12 + 4 + 5 = 27
* Total number of grades = 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9
* Average grade = 27 / 9 = 3
* Milo will get $5 times the average grade he gets
* $5 x 3 = $15
