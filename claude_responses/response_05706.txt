Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peggy buys 3 folders, one each in red, green, and blue
* She puts 10 sheets of paper in each folder
* In the red folder, each sheet of paper gets 3 stickers
* In the green folder, each sheet of paper gets 2 stickers
* In the blue folder, each sheet of paper gets 1 sticker

To calculate the total number of stickers Peggy uses:
* Red folder: 10 sheets x 3 stickers per sheet = 30 stickers
* Green folder: 10 sheets x 2 stickers per sheet = 20 stickers
* Blue folder: 10 sheets x 1 sticker per sheet = 10 stickers

Now we add up the total number of stickers:
* 30 + 20 + 10 = 60 stickers

Answer: 60
