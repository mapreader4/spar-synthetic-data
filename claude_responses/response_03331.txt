Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Hasan initially put 38 dinner plates in the box
* Each plate weighs 10 ounces
* To convert ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since 1 pound = 16 ounces)
* So each plate weighs 10/16 = 0.625 pounds
* The total weight of the 38 plates is 38 * 0.625 = 23.75 pounds
* The movers said the box can only hold 20 pounds before it's too heavy
* So Hasan needed to remove enough plates to get the total weight under 20 pounds
* He kept removing plates until the scale said the box was an acceptable weight for shipping
* Therefore, the number of plates Hasan needed to remove is:
