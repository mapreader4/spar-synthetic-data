Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The class has 18 students in total
* The class is split equally into 3 groups
* Each student takes 4 minutes to go through the museum

First, let's find out how many students are in each group:
* 18 students / 3 groups = 6 students per group

Now, we need to find out how long it takes each group to go through the museum.
* Since each student takes 4 minutes, and there are 6 students per group, it will take 6 * 4 = 24 minutes for each group to go through the museum.

Answer: 24 minutes
