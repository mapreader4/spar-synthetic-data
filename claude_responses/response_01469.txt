Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) James has 28 marbles.
2) He puts them into 4 bags, with the same number of marbles in each bag.
3) To find the number of marbles in each bag, we divide the total number of marbles (28) by the number of bags (4):
28 รท 4 = 7 marbles per bag.
4) James then gives one bag away, which means he has 3 bags left.
5) To find the number of marbles James has left, we multiply the number of bags he has left (3) by the number of marbles in each bag (7):
3 x 7 = 21 marbles.

Answer: 21
