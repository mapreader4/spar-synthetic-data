Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* You run 12 miles in 90 minutes
* To calculate your average speed, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours
* 90 minutes = 90/60 = 1.5 hours
* Average speed = distance / time
* Average speed = 12 miles / 1.5 hours
* Average speed = 8 miles per hour

Answer: 8
