Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Julia starts with $40.
2) She spends half of her money to buy a new game for her phone. So, she spends $20 on the game.
3) She now has $40 - $20 = $20 left.
4) She then spends a quarter of what she has left on in-game purchases. A quarter of $20 is $5.
5) She now has $20 - $5 = $15 left.

Answer: $15
