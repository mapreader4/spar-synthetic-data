Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were some people lifting weights at the start of Bethany's shift.
* Then, 5 more people came in and started running on the treadmill.
* 2 people then left the gym.
* Now, there are 19 people in the gym.

To find the number of people lifting weights at the start of Bethany's shift, we can work backwards:
* The total number of people in the gym at the end is 19.
* 2 people left, so the total number of people before they left was 19 + 2 = 21.
* 5 more people came in, so the total number of people before they came in was 21 - 5 = 16.
* Therefore, the number of people lifting weights at the start of Bethany's shift was 16.

Answer: 16
