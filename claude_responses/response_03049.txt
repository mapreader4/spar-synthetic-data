Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dawn took 20 minutes to wash the dishes
* Andy took six minutes more than two times the number of minutes it took Dawn to wash the dishes
* So, we can calculate the time it took Andy to put away the laundry as follows:
* Two times the number of minutes it took Dawn to wash the dishes is 2 x 20 = 40 minutes
* Andy took six minutes more than that, so it took him 40 + 6 = 46 minutes to put away the laundry

Answer: 46 minutes
