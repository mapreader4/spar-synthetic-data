Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) DeShawn made 12 free-throws.
2) Kayla made 50% more than DeShawn. To calculate this, we take DeShawn's 12 free-throws and add 50% of 12, which is 6. So Kayla made 12 + 6 = 18 free-throws.
3) Annieka made 4 fewer than Kayla. So if Kayla made 18 free-throws, Annieka made 18 - 4 = 14 free-throws.

Answer: 14
