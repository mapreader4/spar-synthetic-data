Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Suzanne's parents have pledged to donate $10 for the first kilometer
* For each successive kilometer, they will double the donation
* So, the donations for each kilometer would be:
  - 1st kilometer: $10
  - 2nd kilometer: $10 x 2 = $20
  - 3rd kilometer: $20 x 2 = $40
  - 4th kilometer: $40 x 2 = $80
  - 5th kilometer: $80 x 2 = $160
* To calculate the total donation, we add up the donations for each kilometer:
  - $10 + $20 + $40 + $80 + $160 = $310

Answer: 310
