Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Max can mow the lawn in 40 minutes
* It takes him twice as long to fertilize the lawn
* To find the time it takes to fertilize the lawn, we take the time it takes to mow the lawn (40 minutes) and multiply it by 2
* 40 minutes x 2 = 80 minutes
* So it takes Max 80 minutes to fertilize the lawn
* To find the total time it takes to both mow and fertilize the lawn, we add the time it takes to mow the lawn (40 minutes) and the time it takes to fertilize the lawn (80 minutes)
* 40 minutes + 80 minutes = 120 minutes

Answer: 120
