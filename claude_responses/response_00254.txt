Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Section G has 15 rows, and each row holds 10 cars. So the total number of cars in Section G is 15 * 10 = 150 cars.
2) Section H has 20 rows, and each row holds 9 cars. So the total number of cars in Section H is 20 * 9 = 180 cars.
3) The total number of cars Nate had to walk past is the sum of the cars in Section G and Section H, which is 150 + 180 = 330 cars.
4) Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute.
5) To find the total time Nate spent searching the parking lot, we divide the total number of cars (330) by the number of cars he can walk past per minute (11).
6) 330 / 11 = 30 minutes.

Answer: 30
