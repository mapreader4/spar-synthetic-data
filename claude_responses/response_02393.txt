Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Robbie weighs 100 pounds.
2) Patty was 4.5 times as heavy as Robbie, which means Patty originally weighed 4.5 * 100 = 450 pounds.
3) Patty has since lost 235 pounds by working out.
4) Patty's current weight is 450 - 235 = 215 pounds.
5) The difference between Patty's current weight and Robbie's weight is 215 - 100 = 115 pounds.

Answer: 115
