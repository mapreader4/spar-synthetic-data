Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mark has 30 candies, Peter has 25 candies, and John has 35 candies.
2) They decided to combine all their candies together, which means the total number of candies is 30 + 25 + 35 = 90 candies.
3) They want to share the candies equally, which means each person will get the same number of candies.
4) To find the number of candies each person will have, we divide the total number of candies (90) by the number of people (3).
5) 90 รท 3 = 30

Answer: 30
