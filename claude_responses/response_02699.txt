Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Wednesday, 37 students played kickball.
* On Thursday, 9 fewer students played kickball.
* To find the number of students who played kickball on Thursday, we subtract 9 from the number of students who played on Wednesday:
* 37 - 9 = 28 students played kickball on Thursday.
* To find the total number of students who played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday, we add the number of students who played on each day:
* 37 + 28 = 65 students.

Answer: 65
