Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jimmy bought 2 candy bars at $.75 each, so the total cost of the candy bars is 2 * $.75 = $1.50.
2) Jimmy bought 4 lollipops at $.25 each, so the total cost of the lollipops is 4 * $.25 = $1.00.
3) The total amount Jimmy spent at the candy store is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.
4) Jimmy spent 1/6 of the money he earned from shoveling snow. This means that the total amount he earned from shoveling snow is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.
5) Jimmy charges $1.5 per driveway. Therefore, the number of driveways he shoveled is $15.00 / $1.5 = 10.
