Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Natalie's father has saved up $10,000 to split up between his kids.
2) Natalie, as the oldest, will get half of the $10,000, which is $5,000.
3) The remaining $5,000 will be split between Rick and Lucy.
4) Rick will get 60% of the remaining $5,000, which is 0.6 * $5,000 = $3,000.
5) After Natalie gets $5,000 and Rick gets $3,000, the remaining amount is $10,000 - $5,000 - $3,000 = $2,000.
6) This remaining $2,000 is what Lucy will get.

Answer: $2,000
