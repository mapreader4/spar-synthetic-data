Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Calen originally had 5 more pencils than Caleb.
2) Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as Candy.
3) Calen lost 10 pencils, leaving him with 10 pencils.

Let's start by finding out how many pencils Calen originally had:
* Calen originally had 5 more pencils than Caleb.
* Calen lost 10 pencils, leaving him with 10 pencils.
* So, Calen originally had 10 + 10 = 20 pencils.

Now let's find out how many pencils Caleb had:
* Calen originally had 5 more pencils than Caleb.
* Calen originally had 20 pencils.
* So, Caleb originally had 20 - 5 = 15 pencils.

Now let's find out how many pencils Candy had:
* Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as Candy.
* Caleb had 15 pencils.
* So, Candy had (15 + 3) / 2 = 9 pencils.

Answer: 9 pencils.
