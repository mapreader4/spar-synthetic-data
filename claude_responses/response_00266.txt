Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week
* He spends 1 hour each day lifting weights
* He also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day

First, let's calculate the time he spends lifting weights each week:
* 3 days per week x 1 hour per day = 3 hours per week

Next, let's calculate the time he spends warming up and doing cardio each week:
* 1 hour per day x 1/3 = 1/3 hour per day
* 3 days per week x 1/3 hour per day = 1 hour per week

Now, we can add the time spent lifting weights and the time spent warming up and doing cardio to get the total time he spends at the gym each week:
* 3 hours per week + 1 hour per week = 4 hours per week

Answer: 4 hours
