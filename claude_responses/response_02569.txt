Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins is 8:3.
2) This means that for every 8 wins Chloe has, Max has 3 wins.
3) We know that Chloe won 24 times.
4) To find how many times Max won, we need to find the ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins, and then use that to calculate Max's wins.
5) The ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins is 8:3.
6) This means that for every 11 total wins (8 for Chloe + 3 for Max), Chloe has 8 of them.
7) So if Chloe has 24 wins, the total number of wins is 24 * 11/8 = 33.
8) Since Chloe has 24 wins, Max must have the remaining 33 - 24 = 9 wins.
