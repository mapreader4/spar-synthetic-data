Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese
* Therese is 5 months older than Aivo
* Leon is 2 months older than Aivo

First, we can find Aivo's age relative to the others:
* Therese is 5 months older than Aivo
* Leon is 2 months older than Aivo
* So, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, and Aivo is 5 months younger than Therese

Next, we can find Jolyn's age relative to the others:
* Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese
* Therese is 5 months older than Aivo
* So, Jolyn is 7 months older than Aivo

Finally, we can find the difference in age between Jolyn and Leon:
* Jolyn is 7 months older than Aivo
* Leon is 2 months older than Aivo
* So, Jolyn is 5 months older than Leon
