Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are one-third as many Ford trucks as Dodge trucks in the parking lot.
2) There are twice as many Ford trucks as Toyota trucks in the parking lot.
3) There are half as many Volkswagen Bugs as there are Toyota trucks in the parking lot.
4) We are told that there are 5 Volkswagen Bugs in the parking lot.
5) Since there are half as many Volkswagen Bugs as Toyota trucks, and there are 5 Volkswagen Bugs, that means there are 10 Toyota trucks in the parking lot.
6) Since there are twice as many Ford trucks as Toyota trucks, and there are 10 Toyota trucks, that means there are 20 Ford trucks in the parking lot.
7) Since there are one-third as many Ford trucks as Dodge trucks, and there are 20 Ford trucks, that means there are 60 Dodge trucks in the parking lot.

Answer: 60
