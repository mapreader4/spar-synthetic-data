Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Meryll wants to write 35 multiple-choice questions
* She has already written 2/5 of the 35 multiple-choice questions
* To calculate how many multiple-choice questions she has already written:
    * 2/5 of 35 = 2/5 * 35 = 14 multiple-choice questions
* So, she has 35 - 14 = 21 multiple-choice questions left to write
* Meryll also wants to write 15 problem-solving questions
* She has already written 1/3 of the 15 problem-solving questions
* To calculate how many problem-solving questions she has already written:
    * 1/3 of 15 = 1/3 * 15 = 5 problem-solving questions
* So, she has 15 - 5 = 10 problem-solving questions left to write
* In total, she needs to write 21 more multiple-choice questions and 10 more problem-solving questions
