Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) When Jessica's mother died, Jessica was half her mother's age.
2) If Jessica's mother were alive now, ten years later, she would have been 70.
3) That means, 10 years ago, when Jessica's mother died, she was 60 years old.
4) Since Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died, that means Jessica was 30 years old when her mother died.
5) Now, 10 years have passed since her mother's death, so Jessica is currently 30 + 10 = 40 years old.

Answer: 40
