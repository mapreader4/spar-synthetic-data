Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janet had $2,225 saved.
2) The apartment costs $1,250 per month.
3) The landlord requires 2 months' rent in advance, which is 2 x $1,250 = $2,500.
4) The landlord also requires a $500 deposit.
5) The total upfront cost to rent the apartment is $2,500 (2 months' rent) + $500 (deposit) = $3,000.
6) Janet has $2,225 saved, but the total upfront cost is $3,000.
7) Therefore, Janet needs $3,000 - $2,225 = $775 more in order to rent the apartment.

Answer: 775
