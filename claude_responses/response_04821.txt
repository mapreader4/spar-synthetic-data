Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The gym costs $12 per month
* There is a $50 down payment
* We need to calculate the cost for the first 3 years

First, let's calculate the monthly cost for 3 years:
* 12 months per year x 3 years = 36 months
* 36 months x $12 per month = $432

Now, let's add the $50 down payment:
* $432 + $50 = $482

Therefore, the total amount Joanie will need to pay for the first 3 years is:

Answer: $482
