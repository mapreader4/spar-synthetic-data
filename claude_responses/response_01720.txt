Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.
2) She paid $480 for the shoes.
3) To find the original price of the shoes, we need to find the price before the 20% discount was applied.
4) Let's call the original price of the shoes "x".
5) The discounted price is 80% of the original price (since the discount is 20%).
6) So the discounted price is 0.8x.
7) We know the discounted price is $480, so we can set up the equation:
0.8x = $480
8) Solving for x, we get:
x = $480 / 0.8
x = $600

Answer: $600
