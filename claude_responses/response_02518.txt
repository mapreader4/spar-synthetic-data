Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Elsa gets 500 MB of cell phone data each month.
2) She spends 300 MB watching Youtube.
3) That leaves her with 500 MB - 300 MB = 200 MB of data remaining.
4) She then spends 2/5 of the remaining 200 MB on Facebook.
5) 2/5 of 200 MB is 2/5 * 200 MB = 80 MB.
6) So, she spends 80 MB on Facebook.
7) That leaves her with 200 MB - 80 MB = 120 MB of data remaining.

Answer: 120 MB
