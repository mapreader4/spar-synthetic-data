Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Earl started on the first floor
* He then went up 5 floors
* He then went down 2 floors
* He then went up 7 floors
* He is now 9 floors away from the top of the building

To find the total number of floors in the building, we need to add up the number of floors he has traveled:
* Starting on the first floor
* Went up 5 floors, so now on the 6th floor
* Went down 2 floors, so now on the 4th floor
* Went up 7 floors, so now on the 11th floor
* He is 9 floors away from the top, so the total number of floors is 11 + 9 = 20

Answer: 20
