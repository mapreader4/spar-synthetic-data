Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The chef can get 25 fries out of 1 potato.
2) The chef has 15 potatoes.
3) The chef needs 200 fries.
4) To calculate the number of fries the chef can make with 15 potatoes, we multiply 15 (the number of potatoes) by 25 (the number of fries per potato): 15 * 25 = 375 fries.
5) Since the chef needs 200 fries, and he can make 375 fries, he will have 375 - 200 = 175 fries leftover.
6) To calculate the number of potatoes leftover, we divide the number of fries leftover (175) by the number of fries per potato (25): 175 / 25 = 7 potatoes.

Answer: 7 potatoes.
