Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt rode a total of 1000 feet away from his house
* The first sign was 350 feet away from his house
* After passing the first sign, he continued riding for an additional 275 feet

To find the distance between the first and second signs, we can subtract the distance to the first sign and the additional 275 feet from the total distance of 1000 feet:
* Total distance = 1000 feet
* Distance to first sign = 350 feet
* Additional distance after first sign = 275 feet
* Distance between first and second signs = 1000 - 350 - 275 = 375 feet

Answer: 375 feet
