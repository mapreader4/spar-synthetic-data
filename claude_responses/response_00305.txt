Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tommy wants to buy 8 new books
* Each book costs $5
* So the total cost of 8 books is:
    * 8 books x $5 per book = $40
* Tommy already has $13
* To calculate how much more he needs to save up, we take the total cost of the books ($40) and subtract the amount he already has ($13):
    * $40 - $13 = $27

Answer: 27
