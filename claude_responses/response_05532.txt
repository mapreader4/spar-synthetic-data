Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emma bought 8 kg of cheese and 7 kg of vegetables.
2) The cost of 1 kg of cheese is $4.
3) The cost of 1 kg of vegetables is $2 more expensive than the cheese, so it costs $6 per kg.
4) To calculate the total cost of the cheese, we multiply the weight (8 kg) by the cost per kg ($4):
   8 kg x $4/kg = $32
5) To calculate the total cost of the vegetables, we multiply the weight (7 kg) by the cost per kg ($6):
   7 kg x $6/kg = $42
6) To get the total cost, we add the cost of the cheese and the cost of the vegetables:
   $32 + $42 = $74

Answer: $74
