Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Each basket is worth 3 points
* Matthew scored 9 points
* To find the number of baskets Matthew made, we divide his total points by the points per basket:
    * 9 points / 3 points per basket = 3 baskets
* Shawn scored 6 points
* To find the number of baskets Shawn made, we divide his total points by the points per basket:
    * 6 points / 3 points per basket = 2 baskets
* To find the total number of baskets made during the game, we add the number of baskets made by Matthew and Shawn:
    * 3 baskets + 2 baskets = 5 baskets

Answer: 5
