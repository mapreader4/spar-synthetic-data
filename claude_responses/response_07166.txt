Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Summer and Jolly both went to the same middle school
* When they finished college, Summer had five more degrees than Jolly
* Summer has a total of 150 degrees

To find the combined number of degrees they both have, we need to first find out how many degrees Jolly has.

Since Summer has 5 more degrees than Jolly, we can subtract 5 from Summer's total of 150 degrees to get Jolly's total:
* Jolly's total degrees = 150 - 5 = 145 degrees

Now, to find the combined number of degrees they both have, we add Summer's and Jolly's degrees together:
* Combined degrees = Summer's degrees + Jolly's degrees
* Combined degrees = 150 + 145 = 295 degrees

Answer: 295
