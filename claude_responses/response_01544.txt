Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ben's bonus is $1496
* He allocates:
  - 1/22 for the kitchen
  - 1/4 for holidays
  - 1/8 for Christmas gifts for his 3 children
* To calculate the amount for each allocation:
  - Kitchen: 1/22 of $1496 = $1496 * 1/22 = $68
  - Holidays: 1/4 of $1496 = $1496 * 1/4 = $374
  - Christmas gifts: 1/8 of $1496 = $1496 * 1/8 = $187
* Adding up the allocated amounts:
  - $68 + $374 + $187 = $629
* To calculate the amount Ben has left:
  - $1496 - $629 = $867

Answer: 867
