Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Tigers played 56 home games this year
* They had 12 losses
* They had half as many ties as losses

First, let's calculate the number of ties:
* Ties = 1/2 * Losses
* Ties = 1/2 * 12 = 6

Now, we can calculate the number of wins:
* Wins = Total games - Losses - Ties
* Wins = 56 - 12 - 6 = 38

Therefore, the Tigers won 38 games.

Answer: 38
