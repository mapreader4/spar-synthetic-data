To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total energy consumed by the electric fan per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

Given information:
- The electric fan uses 75 watts of power.
- John uses the electric fan for 8 hours per day.
- There are 30 days in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the energy consumed by the electric fan per day.
Energy consumed per day = Power × Time
Energy consumed per day = 75 watts × 8 hours = 600 watt-hours (Wh)

Step 2: Convert the energy consumed per day from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh).
1 kWh = 1000 Wh
Energy consumed per day in kWh = 600 Wh / 1000 = 0.6 kWh

Step 3: Calculate the total energy consumed by the electric fan per month.
Energy consumed per month = Energy consumed per day × Number of days in a month
Energy consumed per month = 0.6 kWh × 30 days = 18 kWh

Answer: 18 kWh
