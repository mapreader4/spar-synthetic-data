Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jose's cellar currently holds 2400 bottles of imported wine.
2) Jose's cellar also holds half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine. So, the number of domestic wine bottles is 2400 / 2 = 1200.
3) The total number of bottles in Jose's cellar is the sum of the imported and domestic wine bottles: 2400 + 1200 = 3600.
4) The guests drink one-third of all the wine. One-third of 3600 is 3600 / 3 = 1200.
5) The number of bottles remaining in Jose's cellar is the total number of bottles (3600) minus the number of bottles the guests drank (1200).

Answer: 2400
