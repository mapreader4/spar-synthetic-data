Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Pam's bank account balance tripled during the year.
2) At the end of the year, Pam withdrew $250.
3) Her current balance is $950.
4) To find her starting balance, we need to work backwards:
* Her current balance is $950
* She withdrew $250, so her balance before the withdrawal was $950 + $250 = $1,200
* Her balance tripled during the year, so her starting balance was $1,200 / 3 = $400
Answer: $400
