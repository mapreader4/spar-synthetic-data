Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Angstadt has a total of 120 students throughout the school day.
2) Half of the students are enrolled in Statistics. That means there are 120 / 2 = 60 students enrolled in Statistics.
3) Of the 60 students enrolled in Statistics, 90 percent are seniors. 
4) To find the number of seniors enrolled in Statistics, we take 90% of 60:
90% of 60 = 0.9 * 60 = 54

Answer: 54
