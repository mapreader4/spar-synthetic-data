Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Andy needs to raise the temperature of the candy mixture from 60 degrees to 240 degrees.
2) The candy heats at a rate of 5 degrees per minute.
3) To calculate the time it takes to heat the candy from 60 degrees to 240 degrees, we can use the formula:
Time = (Final Temperature - Initial Temperature) / Heating Rate
Time = (240 degrees - 60 degrees) / 5 degrees per minute
Time = 180 degrees / 5 degrees per minute
Time = 36 minutes
4) Now Andy needs to cool the candy down from 240 degrees to 170 degrees.
5) The candy cools at a rate of 7 degrees per minute.
6) To calculate the time it takes to cool the candy from 240 degrees to 170 degrees, we can use the formula:
Time = (Final Temperature - Initial Temperature) / Cooling Rate
Time = (170 degrees - 240 degrees) / 7 degrees per minute
Time = -70 degrees / 7 degrees per minute
Time = -10 minutes
7) The total time for the candy to be done is the time to heat it plus the time to cool it.
36 minutes + (-10 minutes) = 26 minutes

Answer: 26
