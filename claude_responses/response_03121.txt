Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The whole pizza was cut into 8 slices
* Angeli ate 3/2 slices
* Marlon ate 3/2 slices
* To find the total number of slices eaten, we add Angeli's and Marlon's slices:
  * Angeli's slices: 3/2
  * Marlon's slices: 3/2
  * Total slices eaten: 3/2 + 3/2 = 3
* The original pizza had 8 slices, and 3 slices were eaten, so the number of slices left is:
  * 8 - 3 = 5
