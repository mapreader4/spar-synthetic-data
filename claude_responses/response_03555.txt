Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alex starts with 4 pens in the first week
* Every week, her pen collection doubles
* So, in the second week, she will have 4 x 2 = 8 pens
* In the third week, she will have 8 x 2 = 16 pens
* In the fourth week, she will have 16 x 2 = 32 pens
* Jane will have 16 pens after a month
* To find how many more pens Alex will have than Jane, we subtract Jane's pens from Alex's pens:
* 32 pens - 16 pens = 16 pens

Answer: 16
