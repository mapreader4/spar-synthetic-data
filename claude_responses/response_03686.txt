Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Blake gave some money to his friend Connie.
2) Connie used all the money she had been given to buy some land.
3) In one year, the land tripled in value.
4) Connie sold the land and gave half of all the money she got from the sale to Blake.
5) Connie gave Blake $30,000.
6) We need to find out how much money Blake initially gave to Connie.
7) Let's call the amount of money Blake initially gave to Connie as "x".
8) After the land tripled in value, Connie had 3x.
9) Connie gave half of 3x to Blake, which is 1.5x.
10) Since Connie gave Blake $30,000, we can set up the equation: 1.5x = $30,000.
11) Solving for x, we get: x = $30,000 / 1.5 = $20,000.

Answer: $20,000.
