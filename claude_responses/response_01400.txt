Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Noah's age is twice Joe's age. This means that if Joe is 6 years old, then Noah is 2 * 6 = 12 years old.
2) The question asks how old Noah will be after 10 years. 
3) So, if Noah is currently 12 years old, and 10 years pass, then Noah will be 12 + 10 = 22 years old.

Answer: 22
