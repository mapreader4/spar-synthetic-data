Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Madeline needs to pay:
    - $1200 for rent
    - $400 for groceries
    - $200 for medical expenses
    - $60 for utilities
* She also wants to save $200 for an emergency fund
* So the total amount Madeline needs is:
    - $1200 + $400 + $200 + $60 + $200 = $2060
* Madeline makes $15 per hour at her job
* To calculate the number of hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount needed by her hourly wage:
    - $2060 / $15 per hour = 137.33 hours

Answer: 137 hours
