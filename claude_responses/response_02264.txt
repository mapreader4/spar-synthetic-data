Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sun City has 1000 more than twice as many people as Roseville City.
   * Let's call the number of people in Roseville City 'x'.
   * Then, the number of people in Sun City is 2x + 1000.

2) Roseville City has 500 less than thrice as many people as Willowdale City.
   * Willowdale City has 2000 people.
   * Thrice as many people as Willowdale City is 3 * 2000 = 6000.
   * Roseville City has 500 less than 6000, so Roseville City has 6000 - 500 = 5500 people.
   * Therefore, x = 5500.

3) Plugging in the value for x, we get:
   * Sun City has 2 * 5500 + 1000 = 12000 people.

Answer: 12000
