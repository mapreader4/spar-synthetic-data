Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Abigail needs to write a 1000-word report
* She has already written 200 words
* She can type 300 words in half an hour (30 minutes)

First, we need to calculate how many more words Abigail needs to write:
* Total words needed: 1000
* Words already written: 200
* Remaining words to write: 1000 - 200 = 800 words

Next, we need to calculate how long it will take her to write the remaining 800 words. We know she can type 300 words in 30 minutes, so:
* 800 words / 300 words per 30 minutes = 80/30 = 2.67 half-hours
* 2.67 half-hours x 30 minutes per half-hour = 80 minutes

Therefore, it will take Abigail 80 more minutes to finish the report.

Answer: 80
