Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The box of chocolates has an equal number of chocolates with nuts and without nuts.
* The students eat 80% of the chocolates with nuts.
* The students eat half of the chocolates without nuts.
* There are 28 chocolates left.

Let's call the total number of chocolates in the box 'x'.

Since half of the chocolates have nuts and half do not, the number of chocolates with nuts is x/2 and the number of chocolates without nuts is also x/2.

The students ate 80% of the chocolates with nuts, so the number of chocolates with nuts that were eaten is 0.8 * (x/2) = 0.4x.

The students ate half of the chocolates without nuts, so the number of chocolates without nuts that were eaten is 0.5 * (x/2) = 0.25x.

The total number of chocolates eaten is 0.4x + 0.25x = 0.65x.

The number of chocolates left is x - 0.65x = 0.35x.

We are told that there are 28 chocolates left, so 0.35x = 28.

Solving for x, we get x = 80.

Answer: 80
