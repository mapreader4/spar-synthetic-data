Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* William and Harry played 15 rounds of tic-tac-toe
* William won 5 more rounds than Harry
* Let's say Harry won x rounds
* Then, William won (x + 5) rounds
* The total number of rounds won is 15, so:
* x + (x + 5) = 15
* 2x + 5 = 15
* 2x = 10
* x = 5
* Therefore, Harry won 5 rounds
* And William won (5 + 5) = 10 rounds

Answer: 10
