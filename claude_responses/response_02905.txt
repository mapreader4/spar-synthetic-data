Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pen is 3 centimeters longer than the rubber
* The pen is 2 centimeters shorter than the pencil
* The pencil is 12 centimeters long

First, let's find the length of the pen:
* Since the pen is 2 centimeters shorter than the pencil, and the pencil is 12 centimeters long, the pen must be 12 - 2 = 10 centimeters long.

Next, let's find the length of the rubber:
* Since the pen is 3 centimeters longer than the rubber, and the pen is 10 centimeters long, the rubber must be 10 - 3 = 7 centimeters long.

Now, we can calculate the total length of the rubber, pen, and pencil:
* Total length = length of rubber + length of pen + length of pencil
* Total length = 7 cm + 10 cm + 12 cm = 29 cm

Answer: 29
