Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The forum has 200 members
* The average number of answers posted by each member is 3 times the number of questions asked
* Each user posts an average of 3 questions per hour

First, let's calculate the average number of answers posted by each member:
* If each member posts 3 questions, and the average number of answers is 3 times the number of questions, then each member posts an average of 3 x 3 = 9 answers

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions and answers posted in a day:
* Each user posts an average of 3 questions per hour
* There are 200 members
* There are 24 hours in a day
* So the total number of questions posted in a day is 200 members x 3 questions/hour x 24 hours = 14,400 questions

The total number of answers posted in a day is:
* 200 members x 9 answers/member = 1,800 answers

Therefore, the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day is:
* 14,400 questions + 1,800 answers = 16,200 total

Answer: 16,200
