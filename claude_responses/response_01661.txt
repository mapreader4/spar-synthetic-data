Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim and Donna will celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary in 2025
* They started dating 3 years before they got married
* They met 2 years before they started dating

To find out when they met, we need to work backwards from the 20th wedding anniversary in 2025.

* They got married 20 years before 2025, so they got married in 2005.
* They started dating 3 years before they got married, so they started dating in 2002.
* They met 2 years before they started dating, so they met in 2000.

Answer: 2000
