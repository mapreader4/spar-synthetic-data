Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 7 items, each costing $200
* So the total cost before the discount is:
    - 7 items x $200 per item = $1400
* The store gives a 10% discount for the amount over $1000
* The amount over $1000 is $1400 - $1000 = $400
* The discount on the $400 is 10% of $400 = $40
* Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
    - $1400 - $40 = $1360

Answer: 1360
