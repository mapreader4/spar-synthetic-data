Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Augustus can make 3 milkshakes per hour
* Luna can make 7 milkshakes per hour
* They have been making milkshakes for 8 hours

To find the total number of milkshakes they have made, we need to calculate the number of milkshakes made by each person and then add them together.

For Augustus:
* Augustus can make 3 milkshakes per hour
* He has been working for 8 hours
* So, Augustus has made 3 x 8 = 24 milkshakes

For Luna:
* Luna can make 7 milkshakes per hour
* She has been working for 8 hours
* So, Luna has made 7 x 8 = 56 milkshakes

Now, we add the number of milkshakes made by each person:
* Total milkshakes = 24 + 56 = 80

Answer: 80
