Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* CoinRun's maximum reward is half as much as the maximum ProcGen reward of 240
* The maximum ProcGen reward is 240
* Therefore, the maximum CoinRun reward is 240 / 2 = 120
* Greg's PPO algorithm obtained 90% of the possible reward on the CoinRun environment
* Therefore, the reward obtained by Greg's PPO algorithm is 90% of 120
* 90% of 120 = 0.9 * 120 = 108

Answer: 108
