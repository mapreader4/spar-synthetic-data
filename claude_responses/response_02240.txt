Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shannon bought 5 pints of frozen yogurt, two packs of chewing gum, and five trays of jumbo shrimp
* The total cost of these items was $55
* The price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is $5
* The price of a pack of chewing gum costs half as much as a pint of frozen yogurt

First, let's calculate the total cost of the jumbo shrimp:
* 5 trays of jumbo shrimp at $5 each = 5 x $5 = $25

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the chewing gum:
* The price of a pack of chewing gum is half the price of a pint of frozen yogurt
* Let's call the price of a pint of frozen yogurt x
* Then the price of a pack of chewing gum is x/2
* Shannon bought 2 packs of chewing gum, so the total cost of the chewing gum is 2 x (x/2) = x

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the frozen yogurt:
* Shannon bought 5 pints of frozen yogurt at x dollars each, so the total cost of the frozen yogurt is 5x

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x:
* Total cost = Cost of jumbo shrimp + Cost of chewing gum + Cost of frozen yogurt
* $55 = $25 + x + 5x
* $55 = $25 + 6x
* $30 = 6x
* x = $5

Therefore, the price of a pint of frozen yogurt is $5.
