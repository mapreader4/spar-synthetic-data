Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage.
2) He then rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office.
3) So the total distance from his house to the post office is 5 blocks + 20 blocks = 25 blocks.
4) To get back home, he retraced his steps, so he traveled another 25 blocks.
5) Therefore, the total distance Pete traveled is 25 blocks + 25 blocks = 50 blocks.

Answer: 50
