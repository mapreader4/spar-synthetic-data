Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dan takes 3 hours to dig an adult grave
* Dan takes 2 hours to dig a child's grave
* Dan needs to dig 5 adult graves and 1 child's grave

To calculate the total time it takes Dan to dig all the graves, we need to:
1. Calculate the time it takes to dig the 5 adult graves
   * 5 adult graves x 3 hours per grave = 15 hours
2. Calculate the time it takes to dig the 1 child's grave
   * 1 child's grave x 2 hours per grave = 2 hours
3. Add the time for the adult graves and the child's grave
   * 15 hours + 2 hours = 17 hours

Therefore, it takes Dan 17 hours to dig 5 adult graves and 1 child's grave.
