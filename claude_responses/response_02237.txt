Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary's brother gave her $100 for her birthday.
2) She spent a quarter (1/4) of the $100 on a new video game.
   * 1/4 of $100 = $25
   * So, she spent $25 on the video game.
3) She had $100 - $25 = $75 left.
4) She then spent a fifth (1/5) of the remaining $75 on swimming goggles.
   * 1/5 of $75 = $15
   * So, she spent $15 on the swimming goggles.
5) Finally, she had $75 - $15 = $60 left.

Answer: $60
