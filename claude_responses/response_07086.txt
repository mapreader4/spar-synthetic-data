Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The booth made $50 selling popcorn each day
* The booth made three times as much selling cotton candy as it did selling popcorn
* So, the booth made 3 x $50 = $150 selling cotton candy each day
* The total revenue for the 5-day activity is:
    - Popcorn revenue: $50 x 5 days = $250
    - Cotton candy revenue: $150 x 5 days = $750
    - Total revenue = $250 + $750 = $1,000
* The booth had to pay $30 rent and $75 for the cost of ingredients
* The total expenses are $30 + $75 = $105
* The booth's earnings after paying the rent and cost of ingredients is:
    - Total revenue - Total expenses = $1,000 - $105 = $895

Answer: 895
