Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kalani has 20 candles in her bedroom.
2) The number of candles in the living room is half of the number of candles in the bedroom, which is 20 / 2 = 10 candles.
3) Donovan brings in 20 more candles from the candle shop.
4) To find the total number of candles in the house, we add up the candles in the bedroom, the candles in the living room, and the candles Donovan brought:
   20 + 10 + 20 = 50 candles.

Answer: 50
