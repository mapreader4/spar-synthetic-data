Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lao can sell each chicken for $1.50
* A bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2
* Each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed
* Lao made a profit of $65 from selling chickens

First, let's calculate the cost of feed for each chicken:
* 2 pounds of feed per chicken
* 1 bag of feed costs $2 and contains 20 pounds
* So, the cost of feed per chicken is $2 / 20 pounds * 2 pounds = $0.20

Next, let's calculate the profit per chicken:
* Lao sells each chicken for $1.50
* The cost of feed per chicken is $0.20
* So, the profit per chicken is $1.50 - $0.20 = $1.30

Now, we can calculate the number of chickens Lao sold:
* Lao made a total profit of $65
* The profit per chicken is $1.30
* So, the number of chickens he sold is $65 / $1.30 = 50 chickens

Answer: 50 chickens
