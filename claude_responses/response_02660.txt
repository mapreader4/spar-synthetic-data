Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mr. Salazar had seven dozen oranges. One dozen is equal to 12 oranges, so he had 7 x 12 = 84 oranges.
2) He reserved 1/4 of the oranges for his friend. 1/4 of 84 is 84 / 4 = 21 oranges.
3) The remaining oranges are 84 - 21 = 63 oranges.
4) He was able to sell 3/7 of the remaining oranges yesterday. 3/7 of 63 is (3/7) x 63 = 27 oranges.
5) The remaining oranges after the sale are 63 - 27 = 36 oranges.
6) Today, he saw four rotten oranges. So the number of oranges left to be sold today is 36 - 4 = 32 oranges.

Answer: 32
