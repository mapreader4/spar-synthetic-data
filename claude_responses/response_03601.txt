Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nicole has 4 fish tanks
* The first two tanks need 8 gallons of water each
* The other two tanks need 2 fewer gallons of water each than the first two tanks
* So, the other two tanks need 8 - 2 = 6 gallons of water each
* Nicole needs to change the water of the aquarium every week
* We need to find the total amount of water needed in four weeks

First, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for one week:
* For the first two tanks: 8 gallons x 2 = 16 gallons
* For the other two tanks: 6 gallons x 2 = 12 gallons
* Total water needed per week: 16 + 12 = 28 gallons

Now, to find the total amount of water needed in four weeks, we multiply the weekly amount by 4:
* 28 gallons x 4 = 112 gallons

Answer: 112 gallons
