Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Belle eats 4 dog biscuits and 2 rawhide bones every evening
* Each rawhide bone costs $1
* Each dog biscuit costs $0.25
* We need to calculate the cost for a week (7 days)

First, let's calculate the cost per day:
* 4 dog biscuits x $0.25 = $1
* 2 rawhide bones x $1 = $2
* Total cost per day = $1 + $2 = $3

Now, let's calculate the cost for a week:
* Cost per day x 7 days = $3 x 7 = $21

Answer: $21
