Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The heating plant consumes 7 liters of fuel in 21 hours
* To find the amount of fuel consumed in 90 hours, we need to find the rate of fuel consumption per hour
* The rate of fuel consumption per hour is 7 liters / 21 hours = 1/3 liters per hour
* Now, to find the amount of fuel consumed in 90 hours, we multiply the rate of fuel consumption per hour by the number of hours:
* 1/3 liters per hour x 90 hours = 30 liters

Answer: 30
