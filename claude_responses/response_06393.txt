Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alex has 18 shirts, 12 pants, 17 sweaters, and 13 jeans that need to be washed.
2) The total number of items that need to be washed is 18 + 12 + 17 + 13 = 60 items.
3) The washing machine can wash a maximum of 15 items per cycle.
4) To determine the number of cycles needed, we divide the total number of items (60) by the maximum number of items per cycle (15):
60 / 15 = 4 cycles.
5) Each cycle takes 45 minutes.
6) To calculate the total time, we multiply the number of cycles (4) by the time per cycle (45 minutes):
4 cycles x 45 minutes/cycle = 180 minutes.
7) To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes (180) by 60 minutes/hour:
180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

Answer: 3 hours.
