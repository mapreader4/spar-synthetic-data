Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* During peak hours, the restaurant serves 12 cars every 15 minutes
* From 4 pm - 5 pm is an off-peak hour, so they serve 8 cars every 15 minutes
* From 5 pm - 6 pm is a peak hour, so they serve 12 cars every 15 minutes
* To calculate the total customers served from 4 pm - 6 pm:
* From 4 pm - 5 pm (1 hour), they serve 8 cars every 15 minutes, so that's 8 x 4 = 32 customers
* From 5 pm - 6 pm (1 hour), they serve 12 cars every 15 minutes, so that's 12 x 4 = 48 customers
* Total customers served from 4 pm - 6 pm = 32 + 48 = 80 customers

Answer: 80
