Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In January, Derek puts away $2
* In February, Derek puts away $4
* In March, Derek puts away $8
* In April, Derek puts away $16
* The pattern continues, with the amount Derek puts away each month doubling from the previous month

To find the total amount Derek has saved by December, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:
* S is the total amount saved
* a is the first term (the amount saved in January, which is $2)
* r is the common ratio (the amount each term is multiplied by, which is 2 since the amount doubles each month)
* n is the number of terms (the number of months, which is 12)

Plugging in the values:
* a = $2
* r = 2
* n = 12

S = $2 * (1 - 2^12) / (1 - 2)
S = $2 * (1 - 4096) / (-1)
S = $2 * (-4095) / (-1)
S = $8,190

Answer: $8,190
