Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The maximum safe amount of caffeine per day is 500 mg.
2) Each energy drink has 120 mg of caffeine.
3) Brandy drinks 4 energy drinks.
4) To calculate the total amount of caffeine Brandy has consumed, we multiply the number of energy drinks (4) by the amount of caffeine in each drink (120 mg):
4 x 120 mg = 480 mg of caffeine consumed.
5) To calculate the amount of caffeine Brandy can safely consume more, we subtract the amount she has already consumed (480 mg) from the maximum safe amount (500 mg):
500 mg - 480 mg = 20 mg.

Answer: 20 mg.
