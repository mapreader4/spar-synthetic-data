Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The biggest doll is 243 cm tall.
2) Each doll is 2/3rd the size of the doll that contains it.
3) We want to find the size of the 6th biggest doll.
4) Let's start with the biggest doll, which is 243 cm.
5) The next doll inside would be 2/3 * 243 = 162 cm.
6) The next doll inside would be 2/3 * 162 = 108 cm.
7) The next doll inside would be 2/3 * 108 = 72 cm.
8) The next doll inside would be 2/3 * 72 = 48 cm.
9) The 6th biggest doll would be 2/3 * 48 = 32 cm.

Answer: 32 cm
