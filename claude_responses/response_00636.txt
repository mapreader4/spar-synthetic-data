Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tina has 15 sticky keys that need to be cleaned
* It takes 3 minutes to clean one key
* After cleaning one key, there are 14 keys left to clean
* Tina's assignment will take 10 minutes to complete

To find the total time it will take for Tina to clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment, we need to:
1. Calculate the time it will take to clean the remaining 14 keys
2. Add the time to complete the assignment (10 minutes)

Step 1: Time to clean the remaining 14 keys
* 14 keys x 3 minutes per key = 42 minutes

Step 2: Add the time to complete the assignment
* 42 minutes + 10 minutes = 52 minutes

Answer: 52 minutes
