Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The dish needs to be at 100 degrees before it is ready to eat.
* The dish is currently at 20 degrees when Jenny places it in the oven.
* The dish heats up 5 degrees every minute.
* To find the number of minutes it will take to reach 100 degrees, we need to calculate the temperature increase required and divide it by the temperature increase per minute.
* The temperature increase required is 100 degrees - 20 degrees = 80 degrees.
* The temperature increase per minute is 5 degrees.
* Therefore, the number of minutes it will take is 80 degrees / 5 degrees per minute = 16 minutes.
