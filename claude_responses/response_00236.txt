Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jake starts with $5000.
2) He spends $2800 on a new motorcycle, so he has $5000 - $2800 = $2200 left.
3) He then spends half of what's left on a concert ticket, so he spends $2200 / 2 = $1100 on the concert ticket.
4) He now has $2200 - $1100 = $1100 left.
5) He then loses a fourth of what he has left, which is $1100 / 4 = $275.
6) So he has $1100 - $275 = $825 left.

Answer: 825
