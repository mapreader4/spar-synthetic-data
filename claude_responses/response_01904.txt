Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carla needs to collect 30 leaves and 20 bugs for a project
* The project is due in 10 days
* Carla wants to collect the same daily amount

To calculate the daily amount, we need to find the total number of items Carla needs to collect and divide it by the number of days.

The total number of items is:
* 30 leaves + 20 bugs = 50 items

Now, we divide the total number of items by the number of days:
* 50 items / 10 days = 5 items per day

Therefore, Carla needs to collect 5 items each day to complete the project on time.

Answer: 5
