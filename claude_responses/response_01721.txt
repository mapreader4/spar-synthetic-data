Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Evan's dog weighs 63 pounds.
2) Evan's dog weighs 7 times as much as Ivan's dog.
3) To find the weight of Ivan's dog, we divide Evan's dog's weight by 7:
63 pounds / 7 = 9 pounds
4) Now that we know the weight of both dogs, we can add them together to get the total weight:
Evan's dog: 63 pounds
Ivan's dog: 9 pounds
Total weight: 63 pounds + 9 pounds = 72 pounds

Answer: 72 pounds
