Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sue is traveling from New Orleans to San Francisco
* She lands in New York 16 hours after departing New Orleans
* The journey from New Orleans to New York took 3/4 times as much time as the journey from New York to San Francisco
* She lands in San Francisco 24 hours after departing from New York

First, let's find the time it took to travel from New York to San Francisco:
* She lands in San Francisco 24 hours after departing from New York
* Therefore, the journey from New York to San Francisco took 24 hours

Now, let's find the time it took to travel from New Orleans to New York:
* The journey from New Orleans to New York took 3/4 times as much time as the journey from New York to San Francisco
* The journey from New York to San Francisco took 24 hours
* Therefore, the journey from New Orleans to New York took 3/4 * 24 = 18 hours

Finally, to find the total time she took to reach San Francisco from New Orleans, we add the time it took to travel from New Orleans to New York (18 hours) and the time it took to travel from New York to San Francisco (24 hours):
* Total time = 18 hours + 24 hours = 42 hours

Answer: 42 hours
