Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Aaron wants to purchase a guitar under a payment plan of $100.00 per month for 12 months.
2) The total cost of the guitar without interest would be $100.00 x 12 = $1,200.00.
3) Aaron's father has agreed to lend him the entire amount for the guitar, plus a one-time 10% interest fee for the entire loan.
4) To calculate the interest fee, we take the total cost of the guitar ($1,200.00) and multiply it by 10% (0.10): $1,200.00 x 0.10 = $120.00.
5) The total amount that Aaron will owe his dad is the cost of the guitar ($1,200.00) plus the interest fee ($120.00): $1,200.00 + $120.00 = $1,320.00.

Answer: $1,320
