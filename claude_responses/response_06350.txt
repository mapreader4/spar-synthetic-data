Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackson ate 10 pizza rolls
* Jerome ate twice as many as Jackson, so Jerome ate 2 x 10 = 20 pizza rolls
* Tyler ate one and a half times more than Jerome, so Tyler ate 1.5 x 20 = 30 pizza rolls
* To find how many more pizza rolls Tyler ate than Jackson, we subtract Jackson's amount from Tyler's amount:
* Tyler ate 30 pizza rolls
* Jackson ate 10 pizza rolls
* 30 - 10 = 20

Answer: 20
