Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. When Polly is happy, she tweets 18 times per minute.
2. When Polly is hungry, she tweets 4 times per minute.
3. When Polly watches her reflection, she tweets 45 times per minute.
4. Polly is happy for 20 minutes, hungry for 20 minutes, and watches her reflection for 20 minutes.

To calculate the total number of tweets, we need to multiply the number of tweets per minute by the number of minutes for each state, then add them all together.

Happy tweets: 18 tweets/minute x 20 minutes = 360 tweets
Hungry tweets: 4 tweets/minute x 20 minutes = 80 tweets 
Reflection tweets: 45 tweets/minute x 20 minutes = 900 tweets

Total tweets = 360 + 80 + 900 = 1,340 tweets

Answer: 1,340
