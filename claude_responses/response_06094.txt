Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Walter spent a certain amount of time looking at the seals.
2) He spent eight times as long looking at the penguins as he did looking at the seals.
3) He spent 13 minutes looking at the elephants.
4) In total, he spent 2 hours and 10 minutes at the zoo.

To find the time he spent looking at the seals, we need to set up an equation:
Let x = the time he spent looking at the seals (in minutes)
Then, 8x = the time he spent looking at the penguins
And 13 minutes = the time he spent looking at the elephants

The total time spent at the zoo is 2 hours and 10 minutes, which is 130 minutes.
So, we can set up the equation:
x + 8x + 13 = 130

Solving for x:
9x + 13 = 130
9x = 117
x = 13

Therefore, Walter spent 13 minutes looking at the seals.

Answer: 13
