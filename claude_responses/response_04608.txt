Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Juanita enters a drumming contest
* It costs $10 to enter
* She has 2 minutes to hit as many drums as she can
* If she hits 200 drums, she can start to make money
* She makes 2.5 cents for every drum hit
* Juanita lost $7.5 for joining the contest

To find how many drums she hit, we need to calculate the total amount she made from the drums and subtract the entry fee.

* Entry fee: $10
* Amount made per drum: 2.5 cents = $0.025 per drum
* Total amount lost: $7.5

To find the total amount made from the drums, we can use the formula:
* Total amount made = (Drums hit - 200) * $0.025

Since Juanita lost $7.5, we can set up an equation:
* (Drums hit - 200) * $0.025 - $10 = -$7.5

Solving for the number of drums hit:
* (Drums hit - 200) * $0.025 = -$7.5 + $10
* Drums hit - 200 = 100
* Drums hit = 300

Answer: 300
