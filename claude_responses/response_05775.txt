Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 30 spaces in the parking lot
* Each caravan takes up 2 spaces
* There are currently 3 caravans parked

To calculate the number of vehicles that can still park, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of spaces taken up by the 3 caravans:
   * 3 caravans x 2 spaces each = 6 spaces taken up

2. Subtract the number of spaces taken up by the caravans from the total number of spaces in the parking lot:
   * 30 total spaces - 6 spaces taken up = 24 spaces remaining

Therefore, the number of vehicles that can still park is:
Answer: 24
