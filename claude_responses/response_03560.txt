Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anna wants to have at least 12 large salads
* She estimates that half of the lettuce will be lost to insects and rabbits
* Each lettuce plant is estimated to provide 3 large salads

First, we need to calculate how many salads Anna needs to grow in total, to account for the 50% loss:
* If half of the lettuce is lost, then Anna needs to grow 2 times the amount she wants to end up with
* 12 large salads x 2 = 24 large salads

Next, we need to calculate how many lettuce plants Anna needs to grow to get 24 large salads:
* Each lettuce plant provides 3 large salads
* 24 large salads / 3 large salads per plant = 8 lettuce plants

Therefore, Anna should grow 8 lettuce plants in the garden.

Answer: 8
