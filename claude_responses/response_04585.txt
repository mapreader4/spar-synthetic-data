Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The container of milk holds 2 liters.
2) 1 liter is equal to 1000 ml.
3) So the 2-liter container holds 2 x 1000 = 2000 ml of milk.
4) Jasmine wants to pour portions of 200 ml.
5) To find how many 200 ml portions can be poured, we divide the total amount of milk (2000 ml) by the portion size (200 ml).
6) 2000 ml / 200 ml = 10 portions.
