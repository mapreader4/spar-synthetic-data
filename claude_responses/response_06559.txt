Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are a total of 20 equal tiles in the design
* 3 tiles are yellow
* The number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles
* 6 tiles are purple
* The remaining tiles are white

First, let's find the number of blue tiles:
* The number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles
* Since there are 3 yellow tiles, there must be 4 blue tiles

Now, let's find the number of white tiles:
* We know that there are 3 yellow tiles, 4 blue tiles, and 6 purple tiles
* To find the number of white tiles, we take the total number of tiles (20) and subtract the number of colored tiles:
* 20 - 3 (yellow) - 4 (blue) - 6 (purple) = 7 white tiles
