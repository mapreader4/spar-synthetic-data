Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The price is reduced by 20% if you buy more than 15 units
* You paid $500 to buy 18 units
* To find the original price, we need to work backwards from the discounted price

First, let's calculate the discounted price per unit:
* Total cost = $500
* Number of units = 18
* Discounted price per unit = $500 / 18 = $27.78

Now, we need to find the original price per unit before the 20% discount. To do this, we can use the formula:
* Discounted price = Original price * (1 - Discount percentage)
* $27.78 = Original price * (1 - 0.20)
* Original price = $27.78 / (1 - 0.20)
* Original price = $34.72

Therefore, the original price per unit is $34.72.
