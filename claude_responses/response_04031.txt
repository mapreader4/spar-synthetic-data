Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cheryl placed 300 strawberries into 5 buckets.
2) This means that each bucket initially had 300 / 5 = 60 strawberries.
3) Cheryl then took 20 strawberries out of each bucket.
4) So, the number of strawberries left in each bucket is 60 - 20 = 40.

Answer: 40
