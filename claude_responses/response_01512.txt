Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom served 10 customers per hour
* He worked for 8 hours
* So, the total number of customers he served is 10 customers per hour x 8 hours = 80 customers
* The bonus points he earns are 20% of the number of customers served
* 20% of 80 customers is 0.2 x 80 = 16 bonus points
