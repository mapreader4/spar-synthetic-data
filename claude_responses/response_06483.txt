Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carrie mixed 2 cups of turnips with 5 cups of potatoes, and her kids didn't notice.
* This means the ratio of turnips to potatoes in the mixed dish was 2:5.
* Now, Carrie has 20 cups of potatoes that she wants to add turnips to.
* To maintain the same ratio of 2:5, we can set up a proportion:
* 2 cups turnips / 5 cups potatoes = x cups turnips / 20 cups potatoes
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = (2 * 20) / 5 = 8 cups of turnips

Answer: 8 cups
