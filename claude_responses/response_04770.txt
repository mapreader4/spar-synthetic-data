Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ed stayed in the hotel for 6 hours last night
* The cost for staying in the hotel at night is $1.50 per hour
* So, the cost for the 6 hours last night was:
    * 6 hours x $1.50 per hour = $9
* Ed also stayed in the hotel for 4 hours this morning
* The cost for staying in the hotel in the morning is $2 per hour
* So, the cost for the 4 hours this morning was:
    * 4 hours x $2 per hour = $8
* The total cost for Ed's stay at the hotel was:
    * $9 (for the 6 hours last night) + $8 (for the 4 hours this morning) = $17
* Ed had $80 to begin with
* So, the amount of money Ed had left after paying for his stay at the hotel was:
    * $80 - $17 = $63

Answer: 63
