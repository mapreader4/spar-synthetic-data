Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Keesha needs to get her hair done, which costs $50.
2) Keesha also needs to get a manicure, which costs $30.
3) The total cost of the hair and nails services is $50 + $30 = $80.
4) Keesha needs to add a 20% tip for each beautician.
5) The 20% tip for the hair service is 0.20 * $50 = $10.
6) The 20% tip for the manicure service is 0.20 * $30 = $6.
7) The total cost, including the tips, is $80 + $10 + $6 = $96.
