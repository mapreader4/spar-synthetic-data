Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of the cheapest lamp is $20.
2) The most expensive lamp is 3 times more expensive than the cheapest lamp.
3) To find the cost of the most expensive lamp, we multiply the cost of the cheapest lamp ($20) by 3:
$20 x 3 = $60
4) Frank currently has $90.
5) If Frank buys the most expensive lamp, which costs $60, he will have the remaining amount left:
$90 - $60 = $30
Therefore, the amount of money Frank would have remaining is $30.

Answer: 30
