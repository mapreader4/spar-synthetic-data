Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Ahmed is currently 11 years old
* Fouad is currently 26 years old
* We want to find how many years it will take for Fouad's age to be double Ahmed's current age
* To do this, we need to find the difference between Fouad's age and double Ahmed's current age
* Double Ahmed's current age is 2 x 11 = 22
* Fouad's current age is 26
* The difference between Fouad's age and double Ahmed's age is 26 - 22 = 4
* Therefore, it will take 4 years for Fouad's age to be double Ahmed's current age.
