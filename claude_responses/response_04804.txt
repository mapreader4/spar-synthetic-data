Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils
* Both cucumbers and pencils cost $20 each
* She got a 20% discount on the pencils
* She bought 100 cucumbers

First, let's calculate the number of pencils she bought:
* Since she bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, the number of pencils is half the number of cucumbers
* She bought 100 cucumbers, so the number of pencils is 100 / 2 = 50 pencils

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cucumbers:
* She bought 100 cucumbers at $20 each, so the total cost of the cucumbers is 100 * $20 = $2,000

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
* She got a 20% discount on the pencils, so the discounted price is $20 * (1 - 0.20) = $16 per pencil
* She bought 50 pencils, so the total cost of the pencils is 50 * $16 = $800

Finally, to calculate the total amount she spent, we add the cost of the cucumbers and the cost of the pencils:
* Total amount spent = $2,000 + $800 = $2,800

Answer: $2,800
