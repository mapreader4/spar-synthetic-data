Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emmy originally had 14 iPods
* She lost 6 of those iPods
* So, now she has 14 - 6 = 8 iPods
* Emmy still has twice as many iPods as Rosa
* So, if Emmy has 8 iPods, and that's twice as many as Rosa, then Rosa must have 4 iPods
* To find the total number of iPods that Emmy and Rosa have together, we add the number of iPods they each have:
* Emmy has 8 iPods
* Rosa has 4 iPods
* 8 + 4 = 12 iPods

Answer: 12
