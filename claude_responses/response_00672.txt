Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot per day
* There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag
* Each bag of carrots costs $2.00
* We need to find out how much Harris will spend on carrots in one year

First, let's calculate how many carrots Harris will feed his dog in one year:
* 1 carrot per day x 365 days in a year = 365 carrots per year

Next, let's figure out how many bags of carrots Harris will need to buy in one year:
* 365 carrots per year / 5 carrots per bag = 73 bags of carrots per year

Finally, let's calculate the total cost:
* 73 bags of carrots per year x $2.00 per bag = $146.00 per year

Answer: $146
