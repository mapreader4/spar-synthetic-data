Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Newport Beach has 22 sharks.
2) Dana Point beach has four times the number of sharks as Newport Beach.
3) To find the number of sharks at Dana Point beach, we multiply the number of sharks at Newport Beach by 4:
   * 22 sharks x 4 = 88 sharks at Dana Point beach.
4) To find the total number of sharks on the two beaches, we add the number of sharks at Newport Beach and Dana Point beach:
   * 22 sharks + 88 sharks = 110 sharks.

Answer: 110
