Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Milton has some books about zoology and 4 times as many books about botany.
2) Let's call the number of zoology books 'x'.
3) Then the number of botany books is 4x.
4) The total number of books is 80.
5) So the equation is: x + 4x = 80
6) Solving for x, we get: 5x = 80
7) x = 80/5
8) x = 16

Answer: 16
