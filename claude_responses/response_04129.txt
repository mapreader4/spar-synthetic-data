Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeremie wants to go to the amusement park with 3 friends
* Tickets are $18 for each person
* Each person also needs to buy a set of snacks for $5

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the tickets for Jeremie and his 3 friends
2. Calculate the cost of the snacks for Jeremie and his 3 friends
3. Add the two costs together

Step 1: Cost of tickets
* There are 4 people (Jeremie and 3 friends)
* Tickets cost $18 each
* 4 people x $18 per ticket = $72 for tickets

Step 2: Cost of snacks
* There are 4 people (Jeremie and 3 friends)
* Snacks cost $5 per set
* 4 people x $5 per set of snacks = $20 for snacks

Step 3: Total cost
* Cost of tickets ($72) + Cost of snacks ($20) = $92

Answer: 92
