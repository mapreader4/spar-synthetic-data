Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Martha adds 3 tablespoons of ginger.
2) She adds 1 teaspoon of cardamom and 1 teaspoon of mustard.
3) She adds 2 tablespoons of garlic.
4) She adds four times as much chile powder as mustard, which is 4 teaspoons of chile powder.
5) To calculate the total amount of spice paste, we need to convert the measurements to the same unit. Let's use teaspoons.
6) 3 tablespoons of ginger = 9 teaspoons of ginger.
7) 1 teaspoon of cardamom and 1 teaspoon of mustard = 2 teaspoons.
8) 2 tablespoons of garlic = 6 teaspoons of garlic.
9) 4 teaspoons of chile powder.
10) The total amount of spice paste is 9 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 21 teaspoons.
11) The percentage of ginger in the spice paste is (9 / 21) * 100 = 42.86%.
12) Rounding to the nearest integer, the answer is:
Answer: 43%
