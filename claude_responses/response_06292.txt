Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Allen is 25 years younger than his mother
* In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 41

We can represent this as an equation:
* Let x = Allen's mother's age
* Then Allen's age = x - 25

In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 41, so:
* (x - 25) + (x + 3) = 41
* 2x - 22 = 41
* 2x = 63
* x = 31.5

However, since we are looking for the present age of Allen's mother, we do not include the 3 years. 

Answer: 31
