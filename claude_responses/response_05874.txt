Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that Pond A has twice as many frogs as Pond B.
2) We are also given that there are 32 frogs in Pond A.
3) Since Pond A has twice as many frogs as Pond B, we can divide the number of frogs in Pond A by 2 to get the number of frogs in Pond B.
4) 32 frogs in Pond A / 2 = 16 frogs in Pond B.
5) To find the total number of frogs in both ponds, we add the number of frogs in Pond A and Pond B:
32 frogs in Pond A + 16 frogs in Pond B = 48 frogs in both ponds combined.

Answer: 48
