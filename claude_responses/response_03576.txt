Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Billy swims the first 5 laps in 2 minutes, which is 120 seconds.
2) Billy swims the next 3 laps in 4 minutes, which is 240 seconds.
3) Billy swims the next lap in 1 minute, which is 60 seconds.
4) The total time it took Billy to swim the first 9 laps is 120 + 240 + 60 = 420 seconds.
5) Margaret finishes all 10 laps in 10 minutes, which is 600 seconds.
6) Billy wins the competition by finishing his laps 30 seconds before Margaret, so the total time it took Billy to swim all 10 laps is 600 - 30 = 570 seconds.
7) To find the time it took Billy to swim his final lap, we subtract the time it took him to swim the first 9 laps (420 seconds) from the total time it took him to swim all 10 laps (570 seconds).
8) 570 - 420 = 150 seconds.

Answer: 150 seconds.
