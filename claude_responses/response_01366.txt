Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ivy baked 20 cupcakes in the morning
* She baked 15 more cupcakes in the afternoon than in the morning
* To find the total number of cupcakes baked, we need to add the morning and afternoon batches

First, let's calculate the number of cupcakes baked in the afternoon:
* Ivy baked 15 more cupcakes in the afternoon than in the morning
* So, the number of cupcakes baked in the afternoon = 20 + 15 = 35

Now, to find the total number of cupcakes baked, we add the morning and afternoon batches:
* Total cupcakes baked = 20 + 35 = 55

Answer: 55
