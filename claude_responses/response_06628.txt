Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 20 people came to look at Tracy's art
* 4 of those customers bought 2 paintings each
* 4 customers x 2 paintings each = 8 paintings sold
* 12 of those customers bought 1 painting each
* 12 customers x 1 painting each = 12 paintings sold
* 4 of the last customers bought 4 paintings each
* 4 customers x 4 paintings each = 16 paintings sold
* To find the total number of paintings sold, we add up the paintings sold in each category:
* 8 + 12 + 16 = 36 paintings sold

Answer: 36
