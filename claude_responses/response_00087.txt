Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John's cow initially weighed 400 pounds.
2) The cow increased its weight to 1.5 times its starting weight.
   * 1.5 x 400 pounds = 600 pounds
3) The cow now weighs 600 pounds.
4) John can sell the cow for $3 per pound.
5) The initial value of the cow was:
   * 400 pounds x $3 per pound = $1,200
6) The new value of the cow is:
   * 600 pounds x $3 per pound = $1,800
7) The difference in value is:
   * $1,800 - $1,200 = $600

Answer: $600
