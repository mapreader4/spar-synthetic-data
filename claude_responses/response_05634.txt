Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total sales of the paper cover version:
   * 32,000 copies sold at $0.20 each
   * Total sales = 32,000 x $0.20 = $6,400

2. Calculate the total sales of the hardcover version:
   * 15,000 copies sold at $0.40 each
   * Total sales = 15,000 x $0.40 = $6,000

3. Calculate the author's earnings from the paper cover version:
   * The author gets 6% of the total sales
   * Earnings = 6% of $6,400 = 0.06 x $6,400 = $384

4. Calculate the author's earnings from the hardcover version:
   * The author gets 12% of the total sales
   * Earnings = 12% of $6,000 = 0.12 x $6,000 = $720

5. Calculate the total earnings of the author:
   * Total earnings = Earnings from paper cover + Earnings from hardcover
   * Total earnings = $384 + $720 = $1,104

Answer: $1,104
