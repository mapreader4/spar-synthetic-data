Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nelly wants to buy pizza for herself and 14 friends, so that's a total of 15 people.
2) Each pizza can feed 3 people, so Nelly will need to buy enough pizzas to feed 15 people.
3) 15 people / 3 people per pizza = 5 pizzas needed.
4) Each pizza costs $12, so 5 pizzas will cost 5 * $12 = $60.
5) Nelly earns $4 per night babysitting, so to afford the $60 for the pizzas, she will need to babysit for:
$60 / $4 per night = 15 nights.
