Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts at $12 per kilogram.
2) So the cost of the nuts is 3 kilograms x $12 per kilogram = $36.
3) Adam also bought 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at $8 per kilogram.
4) So the cost of the dried fruits is 2.5 kilograms x $8 per kilogram = $20.
5) To find the total cost of his purchases, we add the cost of the nuts and the cost of the dried fruits:
$36 + $20 = $56.
