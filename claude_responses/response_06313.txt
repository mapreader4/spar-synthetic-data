Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Trevor's older brother was twice his age 20 years ago
* This means that 20 years ago, Trevor's brother was 2x Trevor's age
* Now, Trevor's brother is 32 years old
* So, 20 years ago, Trevor's brother was 32 - 20 = 12 years old
* Since Trevor's brother was twice Trevor's age 20 years ago, that means Trevor was 12 / 2 = 6 years old 20 years ago
* A decade ago is 10 years ago, so Trevor was 6 + 10 = 16 years old a decade ago
