Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices
* He decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5
* To find the number of slices the waiter ate, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 8 = 13
* The waiter's portion is 8 parts out of the 13 total parts
* To find the number of slices the waiter ate, we take 8/13 of the total 78 slices:
* 8/13 * 78 = 48 slices
* Now, we subtract 20 from the number of slices the waiter ate:
* 48 - 20 = 28

Answer: 28
