Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jillian had 80 oranges
* She divided each orange into 10 equal pieces
* Each friend received 4 pieces

To find the number of friends, we need to calculate the total number of pieces and then divide it by the number of pieces each friend received.

The total number of pieces:
* 80 oranges x 10 pieces per orange = 800 pieces

Each friend received 4 pieces, so the number of friends is:
* 800 pieces / 4 pieces per friend = 200 friends

Answer: 200
