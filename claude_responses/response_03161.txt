Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Trevor collected 4 eggs from Gertrude
* Trevor collected 3 eggs from Blanche
* Nancy laid 2 eggs
* Martha laid 2 eggs
* So the total number of eggs collected is:
  - 4 (from Gertrude)
  - 3 (from Blanche)
  - 2 (from Nancy)
  - 2 (from Martha)
  - Total = 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11 eggs
* Trevor then dropped 2 eggs
* So the final number of eggs Trevor had left is:
  - 11 eggs (total collected)
  - 2 eggs (dropped)
  - 11 - 2 = 9 eggs
