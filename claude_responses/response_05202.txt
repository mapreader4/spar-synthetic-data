Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each candy bar costs $2
* Each bag of chips costs $0.50
* Each student wants 1 candy bar and 2 bags of chips
* There are 5 students

First, let's calculate the cost for each student:
* 1 candy bar at $2 = $2
* 2 bags of chips at $0.50 each = $1.00
* Total cost per student = $2 + $1.00 = $3

Now, to find the total cost for all 5 students, we multiply the cost per student by the number of students:
* Total cost = $3 x 5 = $15

Answer: $15
