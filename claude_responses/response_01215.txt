Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 1 US cup = 250ml
* The recipe requires 1/2 a cup of milk per serving
* Brian is making lasagna for himself, his wife, his two kids, his parents, and his wife's parents
* That's a total of 8 people
* Each person is expected to eat 2 servings
* So the total number of servings is 8 people x 2 servings per person = 16 servings
* Each serving requires 1/2 a cup of milk
* So the total amount of milk required is 16 servings x 1/2 cup per serving = 8 cups of milk
* 1 US cup = 250ml, so 8 cups of milk = 8 x 250ml = 2000ml
* 1 carton of milk is 1L, which is 1000ml
* Therefore, Brian needs to buy 2 cartons of 1L milk.
