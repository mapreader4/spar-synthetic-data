Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The room has 5 walls, each measuring 2 meters by 3 meters.
2) The area of each wall is 2 meters x 3 meters = 6 square meters.
3) The total area of all 5 walls is 5 x 6 square meters = 30 square meters.
4) John can paint 1 square meter every 10 minutes.
5) To paint the entire 30 square meters, it would take John 30 x 10 minutes = 300 minutes.
6) There are 10 hours in the time he has to paint everything.
7) 10 hours = 600 minutes.
8) The time he has to spare is 600 minutes - 300 minutes = 300 minutes.
9) 300 minutes = 5 hours.

Answer: 5 hours
