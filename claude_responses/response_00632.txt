Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi.
2) Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom.
3) Bom has 300 watermelon seeds.
4) So, Gwi has 300 + 40 = 340 watermelon seeds.
5) Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi, so Yeon has 3 * 340 = 1,020 watermelon seeds.
6) Adding up the number of watermelon seeds for Bom, Gwi, and Yeon:
   Bom: 300 seeds
   Gwi: 340 seeds
   Yeon: 1,020 seeds
   Total: 300 + 340 + 1,020 = 1,660 seeds.

Answer: 1,660
