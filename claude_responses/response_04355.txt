Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On Saturday, there were 80 people at the football game.
2. On Monday, 20 fewer people were at the football game, so that's 80 - 20 = 60 people.
3. On Wednesday, 50 more people were at the game than on Monday, so that's 60 + 50 = 110 people.
4. On Friday, there were the same number of people as on Saturday and Monday combined, so that's 80 + 60 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who attended the games for the week:
* Saturday: 80 people
* Monday: 60 people
* Wednesday: 110 people
* Friday: 140 people
* Total: 80 + 60 + 110 + 140 = 390 people

The expected total audience for the week was 350 people.
* The difference between the actual attendance and the expected attendance is 390 - 350 = 40 people.

Answer: 40
