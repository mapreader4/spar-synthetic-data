Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cost of each book is $5
* Sheryll bought 10 books
* She was given a discount of $0.5 per book

First, we calculate the total cost of the 10 books without the discount:
* 10 books x $5 per book = $50

Next, we calculate the total discount Sheryll received:
* 10 books x $0.5 per book = $5 discount

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the amount Sheryll paid in all:
* $50 - $5 = $45

Answer: $45
