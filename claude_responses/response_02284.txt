Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 local dance studios
* The total number of students across all 3 studios is 376
* The first studio has 110 students
* The second studio has 135 students
* To find the number of students in the third studio, we need to subtract the number of students in the first two studios from the total number of students across all 3 studios.

The number of students in the first two studios is:
* 110 + 135 = 245 students

To find the number of students in the third studio, we subtract the number of students in the first two studios from the total:
* 376 - 245 = 131 students

Answer: 131
