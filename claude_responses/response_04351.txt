Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joe's mother gave him $56 to go to the store
* Joe bought 7 notebooks
* Each notebook costs $4
* So the total cost of the 7 notebooks is 7 * $4 = $28
* Joe also bought 2 books
* Each book costs $7
* So the total cost of the 2 books is 2 * $7 = $14
* The total amount Joe spent is $28 + $14 = $42
* To find the amount of money Joe has left, we subtract the amount he spent ($42) from the amount his mother gave him ($56)
* $56 - $42 = $14
