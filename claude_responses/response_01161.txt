Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Meena bakes 5 dozen cookies for the school's bake sale.
   * 1 dozen = 12 cookies
   * 5 dozen = 5 x 12 = 60 cookies

2) Meena sells 2 dozen cookies to her biology teacher, Mr. Stone.
   * 2 dozen = 2 x 12 = 24 cookies

3) Meena's friend Brock buys 7 cookies.

4) Meena's friend Katy buys twice as many as Brock.
   * Katy buys 2 x 7 = 14 cookies

5) Now we can calculate the total number of cookies sold:
   * Sold to Mr. Stone: 24 cookies
   * Sold to Brock: 7 cookies
   * Sold to Katy: 14 cookies
   * Total cookies sold: 24 + 7 + 14 = 45 cookies

6) Finally, we can calculate the number of cookies Meena has left:
   * Total cookies baked: 60 cookies
   * Total cookies sold: 45 cookies
   * Cookies left: 60 - 45 = 15 cookies

Answer: 15 cookies
