Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The first player eats 78 seeds.
2) The second player eats 53 seeds.
3) The third player eats 30 more seeds than the second player, which means they eat 53 + 30 = 83 seeds.
4) To find the total number of seeds eaten, we add up the amounts for each player:
78 + 53 + 83 = 214

Answer: 214
