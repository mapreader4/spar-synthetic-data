Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom puts 30 miles per day on his bike for the first 183 days of the year.
2) For the first 183 days, he drives 30 miles per day.
3) So for the first 183 days, he drives a total of 30 miles x 183 days = 5,490 miles.
4) For the remaining days of the year (365 days - 183 days = 182 days), he drives 35 miles per day.
5) For the remaining 182 days, he drives a total of 35 miles x 182 days = 6,370 miles.
6) To get the total miles for the year, we add the miles driven in the first 183 days and the miles driven in the remaining 182 days:
5,490 miles + 6,370 miles = 11,860 miles.

Answer: 11,860 miles.
