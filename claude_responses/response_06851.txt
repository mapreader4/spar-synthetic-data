Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Small glasses cost $3 each
* Large glasses cost $5 each
* Peter has $50 to spend
* He buys 8 small glasses
* He leaves with $1 in change

First, let's calculate the cost of the 8 small glasses:
* 8 small glasses x $3 per glass = $24

Now, we know that Peter has $50 to spend, and he leaves with $1 in change, so the total amount he spent is $49.

To find the number of large glasses he bought, we need to subtract the cost of the small glasses from the total amount he spent:
* $49 - $24 = $25

Since large glasses cost $5 each, we can divide the remaining $25 by $5 to find the number of large glasses he bought:
* $25 / $5 = 5 large glasses
