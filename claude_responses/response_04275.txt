Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The goal is to raise $4,000 for the children's cancer hospital.
* Mary's collection is five times what Ken has, which means Mary has 5 * $600 = $3,000.
* Mary's collection is three times Scott's funds, which means Scott has $3,000 / 3 = $1,000.
* Ken has $600.
* To find the total amount raised, we add up the amounts for each person:
  - Mary: $3,000
  - Scott: $1,000
  - Ken: $600
* The total amount raised is $3,000 + $1,000 + $600 = $4,600.
* The goal was $4,000, so the three have exceeded their goal by $4,600 - $4,000 = $600.

Answer: $600
