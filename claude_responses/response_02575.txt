Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total journey from Abel's house to Alice's house is 35 miles.
2) The journey is divided into 5 equal portions.
3) Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour.
4) After traveling for 0.7 hours, we need to find how many portions of the journey he has covered.

To calculate the distance traveled in 0.7 hours:
* Distance traveled = Speed × Time
* Distance traveled = 40 miles/hour × 0.7 hours
* Distance traveled = 28 miles

Now, to find how many portions of the journey he has covered:
* Each portion of the journey is 35 miles / 5 = 7 miles
* Distance traveled (28 miles) / Length of each portion (7 miles) = 4 portions

Therefore, after traveling for 0.7 hours, Abel has covered 4 portions of the journey.

Answer: 4
