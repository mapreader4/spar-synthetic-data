Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mario has 3 hibiscus plants in his garden
* The first hibiscus plant has 2 flowers
* The second hibiscus plant has twice as many flowers as the first hibiscus plant
   - The first hibiscus plant has 2 flowers
   - So the second hibiscus plant has 2 x 2 = 4 flowers
* The third hibiscus plant has four times as many flowers as the second hibiscus plant
   - The second hibiscus plant has 4 flowers
   - So the third hibiscus plant has 4 x 4 = 16 flowers

Now, to calculate the total number of blossoms:
* First hibiscus plant: 2 flowers
* Second hibiscus plant: 4 flowers
* Third hibiscus plant: 16 flowers
* Total blossoms = 2 + 4 + 16 = 22

Answer: 22
