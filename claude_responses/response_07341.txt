Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) LaKeisha charges $0.10 for every square foot of lawn.
2) The book set costs $150.
3) She has already mowed three 20 x 15 foot lawns.
4) To calculate the total square feet of the three lawns she has already mowed:
   - Each lawn is 20 x 15 feet
   - So each lawn is 20 * 15 = 300 square feet
   - She has mowed 3 lawns, so the total square feet is 3 * 300 = 900 square feet
5) To calculate how much money she has earned so far:
   - She charges $0.10 per square foot
   - So for 900 square feet, she has earned 900 * $0.10 = $90
6) The book set costs $150, and she has already earned $90, so she needs to earn $150 - $90 = $60 more.
7) To calculate how many more square feet she needs to mow:
   - She charges $0.10 per square foot
   - So to earn $60 more, she needs to mow 60 / $0.10 = 600 more square feet.

Answer: 600
