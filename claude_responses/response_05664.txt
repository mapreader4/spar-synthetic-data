Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miriam works 5 hours a day
* She can take care of 60 different flowers in one day
* We want to find how many flowers she can take care of in 6 days

First, we need to find how many flowers Miriam can take care of in one day:
* Miriam can take care of 60 different flowers in one day

Next, we need to find how many flowers Miriam can take care of in 6 days:
* Since Miriam can take care of 60 different flowers in one day, and she works for 6 days, we can multiply 60 by 6 to get the total number of flowers she can take care of in 6 days.
* 60 flowers per day x 6 days = 360 flowers

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 360 flowers
