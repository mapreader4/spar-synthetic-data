Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marie bought 15 glue sticks
* Allison bought 8 more glue sticks than Marie, so Allison bought 15 + 8 = 23 glue sticks
* Marie bought 30 packs of construction paper
* Marie bought six times as many packs of construction paper as Allison, so Allison bought 30 / 6 = 5 packs of construction paper
* In total, Allison bought 23 glue sticks and 5 packs of construction paper
* Therefore, the total number of craft supply items Allison bought is 23 + 5 = 28

Answer: 28
