Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jill can run up the hill at 9 feet/second.
2) The hill is 900 feet long.
3) To find the time it takes Jill to run up the hill, we divide the distance by the speed:
   Time to run up the hill = 900 feet / 9 feet/second = 100 seconds
4) Jill can run down the hill at 12 feet/second.
5) To find the time it takes Jill to run down the hill, we divide the distance by the speed:
   Time to run down the hill = 900 feet / 12 feet/second = 75 seconds
6) The total time is the sum of the time to run up and the time to run down:
   Total time = 100 seconds + 75 seconds = 175 seconds

Answer: 175
