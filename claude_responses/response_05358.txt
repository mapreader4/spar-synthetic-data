Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kataleya bought 400 peaches
* Each peach costs $0.40
* To calculate the total cost of the peaches without any discounts:
  * 400 peaches x $0.40 per peach = $160
* The store offers a $2 discount for every $10 spent
* To calculate the total discount:
  * $160 / $10 = 16 (number of $10 increments)
  * 16 x $2 = $32 (total discount)
* To calculate the final amount paid:
  * $160 - $32 = $128

Answer: 128
