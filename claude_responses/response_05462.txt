Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ann can skate 6 miles per hour
* Glenda can skate 8 miles per hour
* They skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours

To find the distance between them after 3 hours, we need to calculate the total distance each of them has traveled.

Ann's distance:
* Ann can skate 6 miles per hour
* She skates for 3 hours
* So, Ann's total distance is 6 miles per hour x 3 hours = 18 miles

Glenda's distance:
* Glenda can skate 8 miles per hour
* She skates for 3 hours
* So, Glenda's total distance is 8 miles per hour x 3 hours = 24 miles

The total distance between Ann and Glenda is the sum of their individual distances:
* Total distance = Ann's distance + Glenda's distance
* Total distance = 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles

Answer: 42 miles
