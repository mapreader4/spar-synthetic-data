Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark and Sarah have a total of 24 traffic tickets between them
* Mark has twice as many parking tickets as Sarah
* They each have an equal number of speeding tickets
* Sarah has 6 speeding tickets

First, let's determine how many speeding tickets Mark has. Since they each have an equal number of speeding tickets, and Sarah has 6, Mark must also have 6 speeding tickets.

Now, let's determine how many parking tickets they each have. We know that Mark has twice as many parking tickets as Sarah. So if Sarah has x parking tickets, then Mark has 2x parking tickets.

We also know that the total number of traffic tickets between them is 24. So we can set up an equation:
* Speeding tickets (6 + 6) + Parking tickets (x + 2x) = 24
* 12 + 3x = 24
* 3x = 12
* x = 4

Therefore, Sarah has 4 parking tickets, and Mark has 2 times that, which is 8 parking tickets.

Answer: 8
