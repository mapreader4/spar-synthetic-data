Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tony's normal temperature is 95 degrees.
2) The sickness raises his temperature by 10 degrees.
3) To find his new temperature, we add the 10 degree increase to his normal temperature:
95 degrees + 10 degrees = 105 degrees
4) The threshold for a fever is 100 degrees.
5) To find how many degrees above the fever threshold his temperature is, we subtract the fever threshold from his new temperature:
105 degrees - 100 degrees = 5 degrees

Answer: 5 degrees
