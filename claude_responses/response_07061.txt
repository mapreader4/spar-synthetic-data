Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 4 small boxes can fit in 1 big box
* 50 big boxes can fit 4 small boxes each
* Each small box has 40 candles

First, we need to find the total number of small boxes:
* 50 big boxes x 4 small boxes per big box = 200 small boxes

Now, we can calculate the total number of candles in all the small boxes:
* 200 small boxes x 40 candles per small box = 8,000 candles

Answer: 8,000
