Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beth bought 15 more cans of peas than twice the number of cans of corn that she bought.
2) This means that the number of cans of peas is equal to (2 × number of cans of corn) + 15.
3) We are told that Beth bought 35 cans of peas.
4) So we can set up the equation: 35 = (2 × number of cans of corn) + 15.
5) Solving for the number of cans of corn, we get:
35 - 15 = 2 × number of cans of corn
20 = 2 × number of cans of corn
number of cans of corn = 20 / 2
number of cans of corn = 10

Answer: 10
