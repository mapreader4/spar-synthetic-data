Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Amy is currently 15 years old
* Mark is 7 years older than Amy
* So, Mark's current age is 15 + 7 = 22 years old
* The question asks how old Mark will be in 5 years
* To find this, we add 5 years to Mark's current age of 22
* 22 + 5 = 27

Answer: 27
