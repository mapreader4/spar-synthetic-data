Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The floor is a rectangle with dimensions 10 m x 8 m.
2) The area of the rectangular floor is 10 m x 8 m = 80 square meters.
3) The carpet is a square with sides of 4 m.
4) The area of the square carpet is 4 m x 4 m = 16 square meters.
5) The area of the floor that is uncovered is the total area of the floor (80 square meters) minus the area of the carpet (16 square meters).
6) 80 square meters - 16 square meters = 64 square meters.

Answer: 64
