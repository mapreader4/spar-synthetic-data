Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On the first day:
* Eliana walked 200 steps for her morning exercise
* She then did some press-ups (the number of press-ups is not given, so we will ignore this)
* She then added 300 more steps to her count
* So the total number of steps on the first day is 200 + 300 = 500 steps

On the second day:
* Eliana walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day
* So the number of steps on the second day is 2 x 500 = 1,000 steps

On the third day:
* Eliana walked an additional 100 steps
* So the number of steps on the third day is 100

Now, to find the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days, we add up the steps from each day:
* Total steps = 500 + 1,000 + 100 = 1,600 steps

Answer: 1,600
