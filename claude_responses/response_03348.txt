Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Skyler wrote 25 hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts
* He wrote 10 more songs that made it on the top 100 charts than the hit songs
* He wrote 5 fewer songs than the hit songs that were never released

First, let's calculate the number of songs that made it on the top 100 charts:
* 25 hit songs + 10 more songs = 35 songs that made it on the top 100 charts

Next, let's calculate the number of songs that were never released:
* 25 hit songs - 5 fewer songs = 20 songs that were never released

Now, we can add up all the songs Skyler wrote:
* 25 hit songs + 35 songs on the top 100 charts + 20 songs never released = 80 songs in total

Answer: 80
