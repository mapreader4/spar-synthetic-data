Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Billy starts with 6 quarts of raspberry juice.
2) He reduces the juice down to 1/12 of its original volume.
3) The original volume was 6 quarts, so the reduced volume is 6 quarts / 12 = 0.5 quarts.
4) There are 4 cups in a quart, so 0.5 quarts is equivalent to 2 cups.
5) Billy then adds 1 cup of sugar to the 2 cups of reduced juice.
6) The final volume of the syrup is 2 cups + 1 cup = 3 cups.

Answer: 3 cups
