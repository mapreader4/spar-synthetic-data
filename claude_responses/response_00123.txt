To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per can at both the bulk warehouse and the local grocery store, and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- Bulk warehouse: 48 cans of sparkling water for $12.00 a case.
- Local grocery store: 12 cans of sparkling water for $6.00.

Step 1: Calculate the cost per can at the bulk warehouse.
Cost per can at the bulk warehouse = $12.00 / 48 cans = $0.25 per can

Step 2: Calculate the cost per can at the local grocery store.
Cost per can at the local grocery store = $6.00 / 12 cans = $0.50 per can

Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost per can between the two stores.
Difference in cost per can = Cost per can at the local grocery store - Cost per can at the bulk warehouse
Difference in cost per can = $0.50 - $0.25 = $0.25 per can

Step 4: Convert the difference to cents.
Difference in cost per can in cents = $0.25 Ã— 100 cents/dollar = 25 cents

Answer: 25 cents
