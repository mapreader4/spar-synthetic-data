Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jean eats 1 donut for every 2 pages she writes
* She writes 12 pages
* So, the number of donuts she eats is 12 pages / 2 pages per donut = 6 donuts
* Each donut has 150 calories
* Therefore, the total number of calories she eats is 6 donuts x 150 calories per donut = 900 calories

Answer: 900
