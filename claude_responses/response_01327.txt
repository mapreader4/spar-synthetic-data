Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first turn, Allyn hit the ball 180 yards straight toward the hole.
* On the second turn, he hit the ball half as far as the first turn, which would be 90 yards. However, the ball landed 20 yards beyond the hole, so the distance from the starting tee to the hole must be 90 - 20 = 70 yards.
* On the third turn, he hit the ball onto the green and it rolled into the hole.

Therefore, the distance from the starting tee to the hole is:
Answer: 70 yards
