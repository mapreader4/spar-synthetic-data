Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Thomas worked x hours
* Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, so Toby worked 2x - 10 hours
* Rebecca worked 8 hours less than Toby, so Rebecca worked (2x - 10) - 8 = 2x - 18 hours
* The total hours worked by the three of them is 157 hours
* So we can write the equation: x + (2x - 10) + (2x - 18) = 157
* Simplifying, we get: 5x - 28 = 157
* Solving for x, we get: 5x = 185, so x = 37
* Therefore, Rebecca worked 2x - 18 = 2(37) - 18 = 56 hours.

Answer: 56
