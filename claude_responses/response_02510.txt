Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lindsey saved $50 in September, $37 in October, and $11 in November.
2) Adding up her savings, we get: $50 + $37 + $11 = $98.
3) Since Lindsey saved more than $75, her mom gave her an additional $25.
4) So now Lindsey has $98 + $25 = $123 total.
5) Lindsey then spent $87 on a video game.
6) Subtracting the $87 spent from the $123 total, we get: $123 - $87 = $36.
