Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Martin invited 5 people from his hometown.
2. He invited twice as many people from his school, which is 2 * 5 = 10 people.
3. He invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and his school, which is 5 + 10 = 15 people.
4. The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned, which is 20% of (5 + 10 + 15) = 20% of 30 = 6 people.

Adding up all the invitations:
5 (hometown) + 10 (school) + 15 (sports club) + 6 (remaining) = 36 people

Answer: 36
