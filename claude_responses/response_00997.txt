Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day
* They split the fish equally between the three of them
* After splitting the fish, Oomyapeck gets all of the eyes
* Oomyapeck gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself
* Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day

To find out how many fish each of them will be given to eat, we need to first find out how many fish Ittymangnark caught in total.

Since Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day, and he gives 2 of those eyes to his dog, that means he eats 20 eyes himself.
* Since each fish has 2 eyes, that means Oomyapeck ate 10 fish (20 eyes / 2 eyes per fish = 10 fish)

Now, since they split the fish equally between the three of them, and Oomyapeck ate 10 fish, that means Ittymangnark and Kingnook each ate 5 fish (15 fish total - 10 fish for Oomyapeck = 5 fish each).
