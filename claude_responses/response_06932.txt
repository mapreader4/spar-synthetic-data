Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Diana originally gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads.
2) Her dad decided to raise her reward by 20%.
3) Diana read for 12 hours this week.

To calculate the original amount of video game time she would have gotten:
* 12 hours of reading x 30 minutes per hour = 360 minutes of video game time

Now, to calculate the new amount of video game time with the 20% raise:
* 20% of 360 minutes = 0.2 x 360 = 72 minutes
* New amount of video game time = 360 minutes + 72 minutes = 432 minutes

To calculate the difference in video game time:
* 432 minutes - 360 minutes = 72 minutes

Answer: 72 minutes
