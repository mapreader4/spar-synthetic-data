Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The rope has a length of 200 meters.
2) Stefan cuts the rope into four equal parts. This means each part is 200 / 4 = 50 meters long.
3) Stefan gives his mother half of the cut pieces, which means his mother gets 2 pieces, each 50 meters long.
4) Stefan keeps the remaining 2 pieces, each 50 meters long.
5) Stefan then subdivides the remaining 2 pieces into two more equal parts. This means each of the remaining 4 pieces is 50 / 2 = 25 meters long.

Answer: 25 meters
