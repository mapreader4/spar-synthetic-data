Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Pogo, the four-legged martian, leaves 4 footprints every meter.
2) Grimzi, the three-legged Plutonian, leaves 3 footprints every 6 meters.
3) Pogo travels 6000 meters across the soil of Mars.
4) Grimzi travels 6000 meters across the fine sands of Pluto.

To calculate the total number of footprints:

For Pogo:
* Pogo leaves 4 footprints per meter
* Pogo travels 6000 meters
* So Pogo will leave 4 * 6000 = 24,000 footprints on Mars

For Grimzi:
* Grimzi leaves 3 footprints every 6 meters
* Grimzi travels 6000 meters
* So Grimzi will leave (6000 / 6) * 3 = 3,000 footprints on Pluto

Adding the footprints together:
* Total footprints = Pogo's footprints + Grimzi's footprints
* Total footprints = 24,000 + 3,000 = 27,000

Answer: 27,000
