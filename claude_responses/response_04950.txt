Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerome takes 6 hours to run the trail around the park, and he runs at 4 MPH.
2) So the distance of the trail around the park is 6 hours * 4 MPH = 24 miles.
3) Nero takes 3 hours to run the same trail around the park.
4) To find Nero's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.
5) Nero's speed = 24 miles / 3 hours = 8 MPH.

Answer: 8 MPH
