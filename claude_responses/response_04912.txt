Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joey has 30 pages to read for history class
* He will take a break after reading 70% of the pages
* To find 70% of 30 pages, we multiply 30 by 0.70:
  * 30 x 0.70 = 21 pages
* So, Joey will read 21 pages before taking a break
* To find how many pages he has left to read after the break, we subtract 21 from the total of 30 pages:
  * 30 - 21 = 9 pages
