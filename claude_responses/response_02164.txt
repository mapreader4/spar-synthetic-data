Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 24 toys in the box
* 1/4 of the toys are action figures
* To find the number of action figures, we take 1/4 of 24:
    * 1/4 of 24 = 24 * 1/4 = 6 action figures
* The remaining toys are all dolls
* To find the number of dolls, we take the total number of toys (24) and subtract the number of action figures (6):
    * 24 - 6 = 18 dolls

Answer: 18
