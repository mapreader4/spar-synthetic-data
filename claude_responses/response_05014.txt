Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes Ellen 5 minutes to paint 1 lily
* She needs to paint 17 lilies
* So, to paint 17 lilies, it will take her 17 * 5 = 85 minutes

* It takes Ellen 7 minutes to paint 1 rose
* She needs to paint 10 roses
* So, to paint 10 roses, it will take her 10 * 7 = 70 minutes

* It takes Ellen 3 minutes to paint 1 orchid
* She needs to paint 6 orchids
* So, to paint 6 orchids, it will take her 6 * 3 = 18 minutes

* It takes Ellen 2 minutes to paint 1 vine
* She needs to paint 20 vines
* So, to paint 20 vines, it will take her 20 * 2 = 40 minutes

Now, to calculate the total time it will take her:
* Total time = 85 + 70 + 18 + 40 = 213 minutes

Answer: 213
