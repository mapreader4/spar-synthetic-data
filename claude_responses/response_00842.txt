Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The recipe calls for 1/8 of a pound of hamburger per meatball.
2) Antonio has 8 family members, including himself.
3) Antonio uses 4 pounds of hamburger to make the meatballs.
4) To find the total number of meatballs, we divide the total amount of hamburger (4 pounds) by the amount of hamburger per meatball (1/8 pound):
4 pounds / (1/8 pound per meatball) = 32 meatballs
5) Since each member of the family eats an equal number of meatballs, we divide the total number of meatballs (32) by the number of family members (8) to get the number of meatballs each person will eat.
32 meatballs / 8 family members = 4 meatballs per person
6) Therefore, Antonio will eat 4 meatballs.
