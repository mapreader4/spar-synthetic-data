Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mason has 3 cartons of 200 blueberries each, so the total number of blueberries he has is 3 x 200 = 600 blueberries.
2) He makes as many muffins as he can with 10 blueberries per muffin, so the number of blueberry muffins he can make is 600 / 10 = 60 blueberry muffins.
3) He also makes 60 cinnamon muffins.
4) The total number of muffins he made is 60 blueberry muffins + 60 cinnamon muffins = 120 muffins.
5) The number of muffins with blueberries is 60 blueberry muffins.
6) The percentage of all the muffins with blueberries is (60 / 120) x 100 = 50%.

Answer: 50
