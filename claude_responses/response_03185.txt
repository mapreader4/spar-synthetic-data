Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gordon owns 3 restaurants
* His first restaurant serves 20 meals per day
* His second restaurant serves 40 meals per day
* His third restaurant serves 50 meals per day
* We need to find the total number of meals served per week across all 3 restaurants

To calculate the total number of meals served per week, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of meals served per day across all 3 restaurants:
   * First restaurant: 20 meals per day
   * Second restaurant: 40 meals per day
   * Third restaurant: 50 meals per day
   * Total meals per day = 20 + 40 + 50 = 110 meals per day
2. Multiply the total meals per day by the number of days in a week to get the total meals per week:
   * 110 meals per day x 7 days per week = 770 meals per week

Answer: 770
