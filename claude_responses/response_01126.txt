Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mike needs at least 40 bricks of type A
* Mike needs at least 20 bricks of type B (half the amount of type A)
* In total, Mike needs to use 150 bricks

Now, let's calculate the number of bricks of other types he will need to use:
* Total bricks needed: 150
* Bricks of type A: 40
* Bricks of type B: 20
* Total bricks of type A and B: 40 + 20 = 60
* Bricks of other types needed: 150 - 60 = 90

Answer: 90
