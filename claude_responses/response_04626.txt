Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of building the certain house is 100,000 more than the construction cost of each of the other houses in the area.
2) The other houses sell for $320,000 each.
3) The certain house sells for 1.5 times as much as the other houses.
4) To calculate the selling price of the certain house:
   - The other houses sell for $320,000 each
   - The certain house sells for 1.5 times as much
   - So the selling price of the certain house is 1.5 * $320,000 = $480,000
5) To calculate the profit made by spending the extra money to build the certain house:
   - The construction cost of the other houses is unknown, but we know the certain house costs 100,000 more to build
   - The selling price of the certain house is $480,000
   - The selling price of the other houses is $320,000
   - So the extra profit made by spending the extra $100,000 to build the certain house is $480,000 - $320,000 = $160,000

Answer: $160,000
