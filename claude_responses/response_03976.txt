Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The game of Jenga is played with 54 stacked blocks
* There are 5 players, including Jess, who play 5 rounds
* In each round, each player removes one block
* So in the first 5 rounds, 5 players x 5 rounds = 25 blocks were removed
* In the 6th round, Jess's father goes first and removes one block
* Then it's Jess's turn, and she removes a block, causing the tower to fall
* So the tower had 54 blocks - 25 blocks removed in the first 5 rounds - 1 block removed by Jess's father = 28 blocks before Jess's turn.

Answer: 28
