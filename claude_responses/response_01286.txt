Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Olga has 12 yellow fish.
2) She has half as many blue fish as yellow fish. So, the number of blue fish is 12 / 2 = 6.
3) She has twice as many green fish as yellow fish. So, the number of green fish is 12 * 2 = 24.
4) In addition to the yellow, blue, and green fish, we need to account for any other colors of fish Olga has in the aquarium.
5) To find the total number of fish, we add up the yellow, blue, and green fish:
12 + 6 + 24 = 42 fish.

Answer: 42
