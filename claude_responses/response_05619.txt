Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack has 2 $100 bills, which is 2 x $100 = $200
* He has 1 $50 bill, which is $50
* He has 5 $20 bills, which is 5 x $20 = $100
* He has 3 $10 bills, which is 3 x $10 = $30
* He has 7 $5 bills, which is 7 x $5 = $35
* He has 27 $1 bills, which is 27 x $1 = $27
* The total amount of bills is $200 + $50 + $100 + $30 + $35 + $27 = $442
* He is supposed to leave $300 in notes, so the amount he will be handing in is $442 - $300 = $142
* The amount of coins in the till is not specified, so we don't know the exact amount he will be handing in.

Answer: $142
