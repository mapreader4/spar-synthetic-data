Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Val has three times as many dimes as nickels. If she has 20 nickels, then she has 3 x 20 = 60 dimes.
2) Val finds twice as many nickels as she had before in her brother's treasure box. So, she now has 20 + (2 x 20) = 60 nickels.
3) The value of the nickels is 60 x $0.05 = $3.00.
4) The value of the dimes is 60 x $0.10 = $6.00.
5) The total value of the money Val has is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

Answer: $9.00
