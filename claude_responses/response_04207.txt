Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance.
2) She spent $14.
3) To find the total amount of her allowance, we can use the formula:
Amount spent = Percentage of allowance spent * Total allowance
$14 = 0.35 * Total allowance
Total allowance = $14 / 0.35 = $40
4) To find the amount of money left in her allowance, we take the total allowance and subtract the amount spent:
Amount left in allowance = Total allowance - Amount spent
Amount left in allowance = $40 - $14 = $26
Answer: $26
