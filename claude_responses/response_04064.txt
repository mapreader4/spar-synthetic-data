Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of 4 chocolate bars is equal to the cost of 8 magazines.
2) If 1 magazine costs $1, then 8 magazines cost $8.
3) Since the cost of 4 chocolate bars is equal to $8, we can conclude that the cost of 1 chocolate bar is $8 / 4 = $2.
4) A dozen (12) chocolate bars would cost 12 * $2 = $24.

Answer: $24
