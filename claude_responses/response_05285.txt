Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The number of trees is three times more than the number of stones in the courtyard. 
   * If the number of stones is 40, then the number of trees is 3 x 40 = 120.
2) There are twice as many birds in the trees as the combined number of trees and stones in the yard.
   * The combined number of trees and stones is 120 + 40 = 160.
   * The number of birds in the trees is 2 x 160 = 320.

Answer: 320
