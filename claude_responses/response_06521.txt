Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are a total of 4000 trees in the forest.
2) Spruces make up 10% of all the trees, which means there are 0.10 * 4000 = 400 spruce trees.
3) Pines make up 13% of all the trees, which means there are 0.13 * 4000 = 520 pine trees.
4) The number of oak trees is equal to the number of spruce and pine trees combined, which is 400 + 520 = 920 oak trees.
5) To find the number of birch trees, we need to subtract the number of oak, pine, and spruce trees from the total number of trees:
4000 - 920 - 400 - 520 = 2160 birch trees.

Answer: 2160
