Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Johnny bought 15 packs of colored pencils.
2) Each pack has a red, yellow, and green pencil inside.
3) 3 of the packs have two extra red pencils inside.

To calculate the total number of red pencils, we need to:
1) Calculate the number of red pencils in the 12 regular packs:
   * 12 packs x 1 red pencil per pack = 12 red pencils

2) Calculate the number of red pencils in the 3 packs with the extra red pencils:
   * 3 packs x 3 red pencils per pack = 9 extra red pencils

3) Add the number of red pencils from the regular packs and the extra red pencils:
   * 12 red pencils + 9 extra red pencils = 21 red pencils

Answer: 21
