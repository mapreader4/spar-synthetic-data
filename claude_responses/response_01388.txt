Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sami finds 3 spiders in the playground
* Hunter sees 12 ants climbing the wall
* Ming discovers 8 ladybugs in the sandbox
* Ming watches 2 of the ladybugs fly away

To find the total number of insects remaining in the playground, we need to add up the number of spiders, ants, and ladybugs, and then subtract the 2 ladybugs that flew away.

* Spiders: 3
* Ants: 12
* Ladybugs: 8 - 2 = 6

Total insects remaining = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21

Answer: 21
