Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James sells 5 boxes of candy bars, and each box has 10 candy bars.
2) So the total number of candy bars sold is 5 boxes x 10 candy bars per box = 50 candy bars.
3) He sells each candy bar for $1.50, so the total revenue from the sales is 50 candy bars x $1.50 per candy bar = $75.
4) He buys each candy bar for $1, so the total cost of the candy bars is 50 candy bars x $1 per candy bar = $50.
5) The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $75 - $50 = $25.

Answer: $25
