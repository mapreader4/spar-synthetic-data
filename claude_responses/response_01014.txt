Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first hour, Hazel walked 2 kilometers.
* In the second hour, Hazel walked twice as far as in the first hour.
* To calculate the distance walked in the second hour, we take the distance from the first hour and multiply it by 2:
   - Distance walked in the second hour = 2 km x 2 = 4 km
* To calculate the total distance walked in 2 hours, we add the distance from the first hour and the distance from the second hour:
   - Total distance walked = 2 km + 4 km = 6 km

Answer: 6 km
