Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of the sneakers is $120.
2) The man has a coupon for $10 off any pair of sneakers.
3) The membership discount is 10% off any purchase.
4) The membership discount must be applied after the coupon.
5) First, we apply the $10 coupon to the original $120 price, which gives us $120 - $10 = $110.
6) Next, we apply the 10% membership discount to the $110 price. 10% of $110 is $11, so the final price after the discount is $110 - $11 = $99.

Answer: $99
