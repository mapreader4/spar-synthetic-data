Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Dubois buys a new car for $13,380
* He pays $5,400 upfront
* He then pays the remaining amount in monthly installments of $420

To find the number of months it will take to fully pay off the car, we need to:
1. Calculate the remaining amount after the initial $5,400 payment
2. Divide the remaining amount by the monthly payment of $420 to get the number of months

Step 1: Calculate the remaining amount
* Total cost of the car: $13,380
* Initial payment: $5,400
* Remaining amount: $13,380 - $5,400 = $7,980

Step 2: Divide the remaining amount by the monthly payment
* Remaining amount: $7,980
* Monthly payment: $420
* Number of months: $7,980 / $420 = 19 months

Answer: 19 months
