Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ralph watches TV for 4 hours a day from Monday to Friday
* There are 5 days in a week from Monday to Friday
* So, the total hours he watches TV from Monday to Friday is:
  * 4 hours per day x 5 days = 20 hours
* Ralph watches TV for 6 hours a day on Saturday and Sunday
* There are 2 days in a weekend (Saturday and Sunday)
* So, the total hours he watches TV on the weekend is:
  * 6 hours per day x 2 days = 12 hours
* To get the total hours Ralph spends watching TV in one week, we add the hours from Monday-Friday and the hours from Saturday-Sunday:
  * 20 hours + 12 hours = 32 hours

Answer: 32
