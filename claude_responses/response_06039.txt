Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The hotel had operations expenses totaling $100.
2) The hotel received clients whose total payments for services offered totaled 3/4 of the cost of the operations.
3) To calculate the total payments received by the hotel, we take 3/4 of the operations expenses:
   * 3/4 * $100 = $75
4) The loss the hotel incurred is the difference between the operations expenses and the total payments received:
   * $100 - $75 = $25
Answer: $25
