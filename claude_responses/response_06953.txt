Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Haleigh has five 20 oz candles, 5 five ounce candles, and twenty-five one ounce candles.
2) Each candle has 10% of its original wax left.
3) To calculate the total amount of wax available, we need to find the amount of wax in each set of candles and then add them together.
4) For the five 20 oz candles, the total amount of wax is 5 * 20 oz * 0.1 = 10 oz.
5) For the 5 five ounce candles, the total amount of wax is 5 * 5 oz * 0.1 = 2.5 oz.
6) For the twenty-five one ounce candles, the total amount of wax is 25 * 1 oz * 0.1 = 2.5 oz.
7) The total amount of wax available is 10 oz + 2.5 oz + 2.5 oz = 15 oz.
8) Each new candle will be 5 ounces, so the number of new candles that can be made is 15 oz / 5 oz = 3 candles.
