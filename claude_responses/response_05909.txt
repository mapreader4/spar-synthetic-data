Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 2 cars in the driveway, and each car has 4 wheels
* So, the total number of wheels from the cars is 2 cars x 4 wheels per car = 8 wheels
* There are 2 bikes and a trash can, and each of these has 2 wheels
* So, the total number of wheels from the bikes and trash can is (2 bikes + 1 trash can) x 2 wheels per item = 6 wheels
* There is also a tricycle and a pair of old roller skates
* A tricycle has 3 wheels, and a pair of roller skates has 2 wheels
* So, the total number of wheels from the tricycle and roller skates is 3 wheels + 2 wheels = 5 wheels
* Adding up all the wheels:
* 8 wheels (from the cars)
* + 6 wheels (from the bikes and trash can)
* + 5 wheels (from the tricycle and roller skates)
* = 19 wheels

Answer: 19
