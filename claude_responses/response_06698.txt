Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marie has 98 unread messages on her phone
* She decides to read 20 messages a day
* She also gets 6 new messages a day

So, each day:
* She reads 20 messages
* She gets 6 new messages
* This means the net reduction in unread messages is 20 - 6 = 14 messages per day

To find how many days it will take her to read all 98 unread messages, we can divide 98 by the net reduction of 14 messages per day:
* 98 / 14 = 7 days

Therefore, it will take Marie 7 days to read all her unread messages.

Answer: 7
