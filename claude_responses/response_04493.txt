Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janet gets paid 25 cents per post she checks
* It takes her 10 seconds to check a post
* We need to find out how much she earns per hour

First, let's calculate how many posts she can check in an hour:
* There are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour
* So, in one hour, she can check 60 * 60 / 10 = 360 posts

Now, let's calculate her earnings per hour:
* She gets paid 25 cents per post
* So, in one hour, she earns 360 * 0.25 = $90

Answer: $90
