Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Faith bought flour that cost $5 and a cake stand that cost $28.
2) The total cost of her purchases is $5 + $28 = $33.
3) She gave the cashier two $20 bills, which is $40, and $3 in loose coins, which is $3.
4) The total amount she gave the cashier is $40 + $3 = $43.
5) To calculate the change she will receive, we take the total amount she gave the cashier ($43) and subtract the total cost of her purchases ($33).
6) $43 - $33 = $10.
