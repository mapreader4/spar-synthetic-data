Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas
* Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas
* We need to find the cost of 1 bunch of bananas

Let's start by finding the cost of 1 dozen apples:
* Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas
* Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas
* So the cost of 1 dozen apples is ($7 - cost of 1 bunch of bananas) / 2 = ($5 - cost of 1 bunch of bananas) / 1
* Solving this, we get the cost of 1 dozen apples is $1

Now we can find the cost of 1 bunch of bananas:
* Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas
* Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas
* The difference in cost is $2
* Since the only difference is the number of dozen apples, the $2 difference must be the cost of 1 dozen apples
* Therefore, the cost of 1 bunch of bananas is $7 - 2 * $1 = $5
