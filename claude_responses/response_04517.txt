Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The fruit basket contains:
  - 4 bananas, each costing $1
  - 3 apples, each costing $2
  - 24 strawberries, with 12 strawberries costing $4
  - 2 avocados, each costing $3
  - 1 bunch of grapes, with half a bunch costing $2
* To calculate the total cost:
  - Cost of 4 bananas: 4 x $1 = $4
  - Cost of 3 apples: 3 x $2 = $6
  - Cost of 24 strawberries: (24 / 12) x $4 = $8
  - Cost of 2 avocados: 2 x $3 = $6
  - Cost of 1 bunch of grapes: 2 x $2 = $4
* Adding up all the costs:
  - $4 + $6 + $8 + $6 + $4 = $28

Answer: 28
