Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Colbert needs a total of 200 wooden planks for his treehouse
* A quarter of these planks come from Colbert's storage
* A quarter of 200 is 50, so Colbert has 50 planks from his storage
* Half of the 200 planks come from Colbert's parents
* Half of 200 is 100, so Colbert has 100 planks from his parents
* Colbert's friends provide 20 planks
* So the total number of planks Colbert has from his storage, parents, and friends is:
* 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks
* To finish the treehouse, Colbert needs 200 planks total
* So the number of planks he needs to buy from the store is:
* 200 - 170 = 30 planks

Answer: 30
