Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sally had 14 fries at lunch initially.
2) Mark had 36 fries at lunch.
3) Mark gave Sally one-third of his 36 fries.
4) To calculate one-third of 36, we divide 36 by 3: 36 / 3 = 12.
5) So Mark gave Sally 12 additional fries.
6) To calculate the total number of fries Sally had for lunch, we add the initial 14 fries to the 12 fries Mark gave her: 14 + 12 = 26.

Answer: 26
