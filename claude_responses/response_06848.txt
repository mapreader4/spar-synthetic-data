Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Olivia pays 4 quarters for chips
* 1 quarter = $0.25
* So, the cost of the chips is 4 quarters x $0.25 = $1.00
* Olivia pays 12 quarters for soda
* 12 quarters x $0.25 = $3.00
* To find the total amount Olivia pays, we add the cost of the chips and the cost of the soda:
* $1.00 + $3.00 = $4.00
Answer: $4
