Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, Kim brings 3 pairs of earrings. For each pair, she gets 9 gumballs. So, on the first day, she gets 3 x 9 = 27 gumballs.

2. On the second day, Kim brings twice as many earrings as the first day, which is 2 x 3 = 6 pairs. For each pair, she gets 9 gumballs. So, on the second day, she gets 6 x 9 = 54 gumballs.

3. On the third day, Kim brings 1 less than she brought on the second day, which is 6 - 1 = 5 pairs. For each pair, she gets 9 gumballs. So, on the third day, she gets 5 x 9 = 45 gumballs.

4. In total, Kim has acquired 27 + 54 + 45 = 126 gumballs.

5. Kim eats 3 gumballs a day.

To find how many days the gumballs will last, we divide the total number of gumballs by the number of gumballs eaten per day:
126 gumballs / 3 gumballs per day = 42 days

Answer: 42
