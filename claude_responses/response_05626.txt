Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The school has 2000 students.
2) Only 25% of the students voted, which means 2000 * 0.25 = 500 students voted.
3) The winner got 55% of the votes, which means 500 * 0.55 = 275 votes.
4) The loser got the remaining 45% of the votes, which means 500 * 0.45 = 225 votes.
5) To find the difference between the winner's votes and the loser's votes, we subtract:
275 - 225 = 50.

Answer: 50
