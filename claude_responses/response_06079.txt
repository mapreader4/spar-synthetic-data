Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Erin put 16 curlers in her hair.
2) One-fourth of the curlers are small pink ones. 
   * 1/4 of 16 = 4 pink curlers.
3) There are twice as many medium blue curlers as there are pink ones.
   * 2 x 4 = 8 blue curlers.
4) The rest are large green curlers.
   * Total curlers = 16
   * Pink curlers = 4
   * Blue curlers = 8
   * Green curlers = 16 - 4 - 8 = 4 green curlers.

Answer: 4 large green curlers.
