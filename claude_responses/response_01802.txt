Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1. Jason starts with 6 fish in his aquarium.
2. Every day, the number of fish doubles. So, on the first day, he has 6 fish. On the second day, he has 12 fish. On the third day, he has 24 fish.
3. On the third day, he takes out one-third of the fish. One-third of 24 is 8, so he has 16 fish left.
4. On the fourth day, the number of fish doubles again, so he has 32 fish.
5. On the fifth day, he takes out one-fourth of the fish. One-fourth of 32 is 8, so he has 24 fish left.
6. On the sixth day, the number of fish doubles again, so he has 48 fish.
7. On the seventh day, he adds 15 more fish, so he has 63 fish in total.

Answer: 63
