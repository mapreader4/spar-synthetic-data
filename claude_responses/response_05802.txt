Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hannah ran 9 kilometers on Monday
* 1 kilometer = 1000 meters
* So, Hannah ran 9 x 1000 = 9000 meters on Monday

* Hannah ran 4816 meters on Wednesday
* Hannah ran 2095 meters on Friday
* The total distance she ran on Wednesday and Friday is 4816 + 2095 = 6911 meters

* To find how many meters farther she ran on Monday than Wednesday and Friday combined, we subtract the total distance of Wednesday and Friday from the distance she ran on Monday:
* 9000 meters - 6911 meters = 2089 meters

Answer: 2089
