Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mabel lives 4500 steps directly east of Lake High School.
2) Helen lives 3/4 the number of steps that Mabel lives, directly west of the school.
3) To find the number of steps Helen lives, we take 3/4 of 4500 steps:
   * 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 steps
4) To find the total number of steps Mabel will walk to visit Helen, we add the number of steps Mabel lives east of the school (4500) and the number of steps Helen lives west of the school (3375):
   * 4500 + 3375 = 7875 steps

Answer: 7875
