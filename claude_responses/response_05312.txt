Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kekai sold 5 shirts at $1 each, so the total money earned from the shirts is 5 x $1 = $5.
2) Kekai sold 5 pairs of pants at $3 each, so the total money earned from the pants is 5 x $3 = $15.
3) The total money Kekai earned from selling his clothes is $5 + $15 = $20.
4) Kekai gives his parents half of the money he earned, which is $20 / 2 = $10.
5) The amount of money Kekai has left is the total money he earned ($20) minus the amount he gave to his parents ($10).

Answer: $10
