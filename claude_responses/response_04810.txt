Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dawn earns $48,000 per year
2) She receives this in 12 equal monthly payments
3) To find the monthly payment, we divide the yearly salary by 12:
$48,000 / 12 = $4,000 per month
4) She saves 10% of her monthly salary
5) To find the amount she saves each month, we take 10% of her monthly salary:
10% of $4,000 = 0.10 * $4,000 = $400
Answer: $400
