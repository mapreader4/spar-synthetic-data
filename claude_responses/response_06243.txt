Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jebb bought $50 worth of food at the restaurant.
2) There is a service fee of 12% on the $50 food cost.
3) To calculate the service fee, we take 12% of $50:
   * 12% of $50 = 0.12 x $50 = $6
4) So the total cost of the food and service fee is $50 + $6 = $56.
5) Jebb then gave a $5 tip on top of the $56 total.
6) Therefore, the total amount of money Jebb spent at the restaurant is $56 + $5 = $61.
