Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The book series has a total of 54 books
* In the first week, Cody read 6 books
* In the second week, Cody read 3 books
* After the first two weeks, Cody read 9 books per week

Now, let's calculate the number of weeks it took Cody to read the entire series:
* First two weeks: 6 + 3 = 9 books read
* Remaining books to read: 54 - 9 = 45 books
* At 9 books per week, it will take 45 / 9 = 5 more weeks to read the remaining books
* Total weeks = 2 (first two weeks) + 5 (remaining weeks) = 7 weeks
