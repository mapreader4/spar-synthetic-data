Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bakery makes 300 doughnuts for the day.
2) Each box of doughnuts holds 10 doughnuts.
3) The bakery sells 27 boxes of doughnuts throughout the day.
4) To calculate the total number of doughnuts sold, we multiply the number of boxes sold (27) by the number of doughnuts per box (10):
27 boxes x 10 doughnuts/box = 270 doughnuts sold
5) To calculate the number of doughnuts given away at the end of the day, we take the total number of doughnuts made (300) and subtract the number of doughnuts sold (270):
300 doughnuts - 270 doughnuts sold = 30 doughnuts given away

Answer: 30
