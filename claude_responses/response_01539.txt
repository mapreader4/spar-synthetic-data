Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first buyer offered to pay the full price of $5200, but Chris would have to pay for the car maintenance inspection, which costs a tenth of the asking price.
   * The cost of the car maintenance inspection is 1/10 of $5200 = $520.
   * So, the amount Chris would earn from the first offer is $5200 - $520 = $4680.

2. The second buyer agreed to pay the full price of $5200, but Chris would have to replace the headlights for $80 and the tires for three times as much.
   * The cost of the tires is 3 times $80 = $240.
   * The total cost for Chris is $80 + $240 = $320.
   * So, the amount Chris would earn from the second offer is $5200 - $320 = $4880.

3. To find the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers, we subtract the first offer from the second offer:
   * $4880 - $4680 = $200.

Answer: $200.
