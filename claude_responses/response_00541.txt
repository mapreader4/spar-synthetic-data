Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tonya has 2 sisters
* She wants to spend the exact same amount on each sister
* For her younger sister, she bought 4 dolls that cost $15 each
* So the total amount spent on the younger sister is:
    - 4 dolls x $15 per doll = $60
* For her older sister, she plans to buy Lego sets that cost $20 each
* Since Tonya wants to spend the same amount on each sister, the amount spent on the older sister must also be $60
* To find the number of Lego sets she buys for the older sister, we divide the total amount spent ($60) by the cost per Lego set ($20):
    - $60 / $20 per Lego set = 3 Lego sets
