Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roque takes 2 hours to walk to work
* Roque takes 1 hour to ride his bike to work
* Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week
* Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week

To calculate the total time Roque takes to get to and from work a week:
* Walking to work: 3 days x 2 hours = 6 hours
* Walking from work: 3 days x 2 hours = 6 hours
* Total walking time: 6 hours + 6 hours = 12 hours
* Biking to work: 2 days x 1 hour = 2 hours
* Biking from work: 2 days x 1 hour = 2 hours
* Total biking time: 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours
* Total time per week: 12 hours + 4 hours = 16 hours

Answer: 16 hours
