Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Julian has 80 Facebook friends.
2. 60% of Julian's friends are boys, and 40% are girls.
   * To find the number of boys, we take 60% of 80: 0.6 * 80 = 48 boys.
   * To find the number of girls, we take 40% of 80: 0.4 * 80 = 32 girls.
3. Boyd has twice as many friends who are girls as Julian does.
   * Julian has 32 girl friends, so Boyd has 2 * 32 = 64 girl friends.
4. Boyd has 100 friends total.
   * Since we know Boyd has 64 girl friends, we can find the number of boy friends by subtracting 64 from 100: 100 - 64 = 36 boy friends.
5. To find the percentage of Boyd's friends who are boys, we divide the number of boy friends by the total number of friends and multiply by 100:
   * Percentage of Boyd's friends who are boys = (36 / 100) * 100 = 36%

Answer: 36
