Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The distance to the other town is 140 km
* Samson's car uses 10 liters of gasoline for a distance of 70 km
* To find the amount of gasoline needed for the 140 km trip, we can set up a proportion:
* 70 km : 10 liters = 140 km : x liters
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 70x = 1400
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = 1400 / 70
* x = 20 liters

Answer: 20 liters
