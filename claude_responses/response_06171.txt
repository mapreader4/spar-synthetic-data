Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ted needs to purchase 5 bananas
* Each banana costs $2
* So the total cost of the 5 bananas is:
    - 5 bananas x $2 per banana = $10
* Ted also needs to purchase 10 oranges
* Each orange costs $1.50
* So the total cost of the 10 oranges is:
    - 10 oranges x $1.50 per orange = $15
* To calculate the total amount of money Ted needs to purchase 5 bananas and 10 oranges, we add the cost of the bananas and the cost of the oranges:
    - $10 + $15 = $25

Answer: $25
