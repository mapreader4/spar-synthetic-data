Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Jonsey:
* Jonsey is awake for 2/3 of the day
* She spends 1/2 of her awake time playing outside
* Therefore, she spends the other 1/2 of her awake time inside

So, the amount of time Jonsey spends inside is:
* 2/3 day * 1/2 = 1/3 day

Riley:
* Riley is awake for 3/4 of the day
* He spends 1/3 of his awake time outside
* Therefore, he spends the other 2/3 of his awake time inside

So, the amount of time Riley spends inside is:
* 3/4 day * 2/3 = 1/2 day

Now, to find the average time they spend inside, we add the time Jonsey spends inside and the time Riley spends inside, and divide by 2:
* (1/3 day + 1/2 day) / 2 = 5/12 day

Answer: 5/12 day
