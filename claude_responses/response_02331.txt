Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Henri has 8 hours of free time.
2) He watches one movie that is 3.5 hours and one movie that is 1.5 hours.
3) So the total time spent watching movies is 3.5 + 1.5 = 5 hours.
4) That leaves him with 8 - 5 = 3 hours of reading time.
5) He can read 10 words per minute.
6) There are 60 minutes in an hour.
7) So in 3 hours, he can read 10 words/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 3 hours = 1,800 words.

Answer: 1,800
