Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's birthday party
* This means that if Taylor's party had x people, then Ryan's party had 4x people
* The total number of people at both parties combined was 240
* So, we can write this as an equation:
x + 4x = 240
* Solving for x, we get:
5x = 240
x = 48
* Since Ryan's party had 4 times as many people as Taylor's party, and Taylor's party had 48 people, then Ryan's party had:
4 x 48 = 192 people

Answer: 192
