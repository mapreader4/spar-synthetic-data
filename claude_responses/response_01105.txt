Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gina had $400 to start with.
* She gave 1/4 of her money to her mom. 1/4 of $400 is $100, so she gave her mom $100.
* She used 1/8 of her money to buy clothes. 1/8 of $400 is $50, so she spent $50 on clothes.
* She gave 1/5 of her money to a charity. 1/5 of $400 is $80, so she gave $80 to charity.
* The remaining money is what Gina kept.
* To calculate the remaining money, we take the original $400 and subtract the amounts she gave away:
* $400 - $100 - $50 - $80 = $170
* Therefore, Gina kept $170.

Answer: 170
