Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Azalea had 200 sheep that were sheared.
2) Each sheep produced 10 pounds of wool.
3) So the total amount of wool produced is 200 sheep * 10 pounds per sheep = 2,000 pounds of wool.
4) Azalea sold each pound of wool for $20.
5) So the total revenue from selling the wool is 2,000 pounds * $20 per pound = $40,000.
6) Azalea paid the shearer $2,000 for his work.
7) The profit is the total revenue minus the cost of the shearer:
   $40,000 - $2,000 = $38,000.

Answer: $38,000
