Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kim spends 5 minutes making coffee every morning
* She spends 2 minutes per employee getting a status update
* There are 9 employees in the office
* So for the status updates, she spends 2 minutes x 9 employees = 18 minutes
* She also spends 3 minutes per employee updating payroll records
* Again, there are 9 employees in the office
* So for the payroll updates, she spends 3 minutes x 9 employees = 27 minutes
* Adding up the time for coffee, status updates, and payroll updates:
* 5 minutes + 18 minutes + 27 minutes = 50 minutes

Answer: 50
