Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour.
2) Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.
3) Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour.

First, let's find out how many pages Lucy can read in 1 hour:
* Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour.
* Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.
* Therefore, Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour.

Now, we can find out how many pages Carter can read in 1 hour:
* Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour.
* Lucy can read 60 pages in 1 hour.
* Therefore, Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour.

Answer: 30
