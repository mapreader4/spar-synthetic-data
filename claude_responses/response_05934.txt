Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ms. Cole has three levels of math classes: fourth-level, sixth-level, and seventh-level
* There are four times as many students in the fourth-level class as in the sixth-level class
* The number of students in the seventh-level class is twice that of the fourth-level class
* The sixth-level class has 40 students

First, let's find the number of students in the fourth-level class:
* Since the sixth-level class has 40 students, and there are four times as many students in the fourth-level class, we can calculate the number of students in the fourth-level class as:
* 4 x 40 = 160 students in the fourth-level class

Next, let's find the number of students in the seventh-level class:
* Since the number of students in the seventh-level class is twice that of the fourth-level class, we can calculate the number of students in the seventh-level class as:
* 2 x 160 = 320 students in the seventh-level class

Finally, to find the total number of math students Ms. Cole teaches, we add up the number of students in each of the three classes:
* 40 (sixth-level) + 160 (fourth-level) + 320 (seventh-level) = 520 students

Answer: 520
