Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Conor can chop 12 eggplants, 9 carrots, and 8 potatoes in a day
* He works 4 times a week
* To find the total number of vegetables he can chop in a week, we need to add up the number of each vegetable he can chop in a day, and then multiply that by the number of days he works in a week.

* Eggplants per week: 12 eggplants per day x 4 days per week = 48 eggplants
* Carrots per week: 9 carrots per day x 4 days per week = 36 carrots
* Potatoes per week: 8 potatoes per day x 4 days per week = 32 potatoes

* To find the total number of vegetables, we add up the number of each vegetable:
48 eggplants + 36 carrots + 32 potatoes = 116 vegetables

Answer: 116
