Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Aniyah has 6 times as many birthday candles as Ambika.
2) Ambika has 4 birthday candles.
3) To find how many birthday candles Aniyah has, we multiply Ambika's 4 candles by 6:
4 candles x 6 = 24 candles
4) Now, to find the total number of birthday candles they have together, we add Ambika's 4 candles and Aniyah's 24 candles:
4 candles + 24 candles = 28 candles
5) If they share the 28 candles equally between themselves, each of them will have:
28 candles / 2 = 14 candles

Answer: 14
