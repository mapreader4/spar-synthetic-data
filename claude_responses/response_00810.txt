Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tyler initially has 21 CDs.
2) He gives away a third of his CDs to his friend. To find a third of 21, we divide 21 by 3, which is 7. So he gives away 7 CDs.
3) Now Tyler has 21 - 7 = 14 CDs.
4) He then goes to the music store and buys 8 brand new CDs.
5) So now Tyler has 14 + 8 = 22 CDs.

Answer: 22
