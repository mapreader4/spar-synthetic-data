Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jen buys 50 candy bars at 80 cents each. So the total cost for the 50 candy bars is:
50 candy bars x 80 cents per candy bar = 4000 cents
2) Jen sells 48 of the candy bars at a dollar each. So the total revenue from selling the 48 candy bars is:
48 candy bars x 100 cents per candy bar = 4800 cents
3) To calculate the profit, we take the total revenue and subtract the total cost:
4800 cents (total revenue) - 4000 cents (total cost) = 800 cents

Answer: 800 cents
