To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the car in miles per hour.

Given information:
- The car traveled 360 miles.
- The car traveled for 4 hours and 30 minutes.

Step 1: Convert the time from hours and minutes to just hours.
4 hours and 30 minutes = 4.5 hours

Step 2: Calculate the speed of the car in miles per hour.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 360 miles / 4.5 hours
Speed = 80 miles per hour

Answer: 80 miles per hour.
