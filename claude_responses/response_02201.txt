Okay, let's break this down step by step:

* Two days ago, Uncle Welly planted 50 roses.
* Yesterday, he planted 20 more roses than the previous day, which was 50 + 20 = 70 roses.
* Today, he planted twice the number of roses than two days ago, which was 2 Ã— 50 = 100 roses.

Now, to find the total number of roses planted in the vacant lot, we add up the roses planted on each day:
* Total roses planted = 50 + 70 + 100 = 220 roses

Answer: 220
