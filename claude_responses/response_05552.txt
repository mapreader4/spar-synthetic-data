Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first three episodes are 58 minutes, 62 minutes, and 65 minutes long respectively.
* The total duration of the four episodes is 4 hours.
* To find the duration of the fourth episode, we need to first calculate the total duration of the first three episodes.
* The total duration of the first three episodes is:
  - 58 minutes + 62 minutes + 65 minutes = 185 minutes
* Since the total duration of the four episodes is 4 hours, and we know the duration of the first three episodes is 185 minutes, we can calculate the duration of the fourth episode:
  - 4 hours = 240 minutes
  - 240 minutes - 185 minutes = 55 minutes

Answer: 55 minutes
