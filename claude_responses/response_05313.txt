Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The birthday cake has 240 cake pieces.
2) After singing the birthday song, they ate 60% of the cake's pieces.
3) To calculate 60% of 240 pieces, we multiply 240 by 0.6 (60% expressed as a decimal):
   240 * 0.6 = 144 pieces eaten
4) The remaining pieces are 240 - 144 = 96 pieces.
5) Juelz divided the remaining 96 pieces among his three sisters.
6) To calculate the number of pieces each sister received, we divide the 96 pieces by 3:
   96 / 3 = 32 pieces per sister.

Answer: 32
