Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Madeline wants to plant 20 flowers in her garden.
2) She assumes that about half of the seeds she plants will die before they bloom.
3) This means she needs to plant 40 seeds (20 flowers x 2) to end up with 20 flowers.
4) The flower shop sells packs of seeds with 25 seeds per pack.
5) To get 40 seeds, Madeline will need to buy 2 packs of seeds (40 seeds / 25 seeds per pack = 1.6 packs, rounded up to 2 packs).
6) Each pack of seeds costs $5.
7) Therefore, the total cost for Madeline to buy the seeds to plant 20 flowers is:
Answer: 2 packs x $5 per pack = $10
