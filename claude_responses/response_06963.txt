Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leila bought:
  - Apples for 5€
  - Sugar for 3€
  - Carrots for 17€
* So the total amount Leila spent is:
  - 5€ + 3€ + 17€ = 25€
* Leila paid with a 50€ bill
* To calculate the amount the saleswoman should return to Leila, we take the amount Leila paid (50€) and subtract the total amount she spent (25€):
  - 50€ - 25€ = 25€

Answer: 25
