Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Fred spent half of his allowance going to the movies.
2) He then washed the family car and earned $6.
3) He ended up with $14.

To find his weekly allowance, we can work backwards:
* He ended up with $14
* He earned $6 from washing the car
* So, he must have had $8 before earning the $6
* Since he spent half of his allowance on the movies, his original allowance must have been $16
