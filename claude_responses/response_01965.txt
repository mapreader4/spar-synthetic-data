Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Year 1: Grandma Molly created 4 turtle statues and placed them on her front lawn.
Number of statues at the end of Year 1: 4

Year 2: Grandma Molly quadrupled the number of statues on her front lawn.
Number of statues at the end of Year 2: 4 x 4 = 16

Year 3: Grandma Molly added 12 more statues to the front lawn, but 3 were broken and thrown away.
Number of statues added in Year 3: 12
Number of statues broken in Year 3: 3
Number of statues at the end of Year 3: 16 + 12 - 3 = 25

Year 4: Grandma Molly added twice as many new statues as had been broken the year before.
Number of statues added in Year 4: 2 x 3 = 6
Number of statues at the end of Year 4: 25 + 6 = 31

Answer: 31 turtle statues were on Grandma Molly's front lawn at the end of the four years.
