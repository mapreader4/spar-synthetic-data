Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The kitchen dimensions are 12 feet by 16 feet, with 10 foot high ceilings.
2) To calculate the total area to be painted, we need to find the area of each wall:
   - Wall 1: 12 feet x 10 feet = 120 square feet
   - Wall 2: 16 feet x 10 feet = 160 square feet
   - Wall 3: 12 feet x 10 feet = 120 square feet
   - Wall 4: 16 feet x 10 feet = 160 square feet
3) The total area to be painted is the sum of the four walls: 120 + 160 + 120 + 160 = 560 square feet.
4) Each wall needs one coat of primer and two coats of paint, so the total area to be painted is 3 x 560 = 1,680 square feet.
5) Martha can paint 40 square feet per hour.
6) To calculate the total time it will take Martha to paint the kitchen, we divide the total area (1,680 square feet) by the rate (40 square feet per hour):
   1,680 square feet / 40 square feet per hour = 42 hours.

Answer: 42 hours.
