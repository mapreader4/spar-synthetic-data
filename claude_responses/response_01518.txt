Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of cupcakes ordered: 80
* Half of the cupcakes are gluten-free: 80 / 2 = 40 gluten-free cupcakes
* There are 24 vegan cupcakes
* Half of the vegan cupcakes are also gluten-free: 24 / 2 = 12 vegan gluten-free cupcakes

Now, to find the number of non-vegan cupcakes that contain gluten, we need to subtract the number of gluten-free cupcakes (both vegan and non-vegan) from the total number of cupcakes:
* Total cupcakes - Gluten-free cupcakes = Non-gluten-free cupcakes
* 80 - 40 - 12 = 28 non-vegan cupcakes that contain gluten

Answer: 28
