Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Amanda received $50 as a gift.
2) She plans to buy:
   - 2 cassette tapes that cost $9 each, so 2 * $9 = $18 for the tapes
   - 1 headphone set that costs $25
3) To calculate the total amount she plans to spend:
   - Tapes: $18
   - Headphones: $25
   - Total: $18 + $25 = $43
4) Now, to calculate how much money she will have left:
   - Initial gift: $50
   - Total spent: $43
   - Amount left: $50 - $43 = $7

Answer: $7
