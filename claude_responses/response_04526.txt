Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom needs 10 different vaccines, each costing $45
* The total cost of the vaccines is 10 * $45 = $450
* Tom also needs a doctor's visit, which costs $250
* The total medical costs are $450 + $250 = $700
* However, Tom's insurance will cover 80% of these medical bills
* The amount Tom will have to pay for the medical bills is 20% of $700, which is 0.2 * $700 = $140
* The trip itself costs $1200
* Therefore, the total amount Tom will have to pay is the medical bills ($140) plus the trip cost ($1200), which is $140 + $1200 = $1340

Answer: $1340
