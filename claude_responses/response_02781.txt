Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Patrick finishes the race in 60 seconds.
2) Manu took 12 more seconds than Patrick to finish the race.
   * So, Manu's time = 60 seconds + 12 seconds = 72 seconds.
3) Amy is twice as fast as Manu.
   * This means that Amy's time is half of Manu's time.
   * Manu's time = 72 seconds.
   * Amy's time = 72 seconds / 2 = 36 seconds.

Answer: 36
