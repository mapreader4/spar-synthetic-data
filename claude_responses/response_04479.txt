Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob grew 50 bushels of corn
* His friend Terry took 8 bushels
* His friend Jerry took 3 bushels
* He gave 12 bushels to his friend Linda
* He gave 21 ears of corn to his neighbor Stacy

First, let's calculate how many ears of corn were in the 50 bushels he grew:
* 50 bushels x 14 ears per bushel = 700 ears of corn

Now, let's calculate how many ears of corn he gave away:
* Terry took 8 bushels, which is 8 x 14 = 112 ears
* Jerry took 3 bushels, which is 3 x 14 = 42 ears
* Linda took 12 bushels, which is 12 x 14 = 168 ears
* Stacy took 21 ears

Adding up the total ears of corn given away:
* 112 + 42 + 168 + 21 = 343 ears

Finally, to calculate the number of ears of corn Bob has left:
* 700 ears - 343 ears = 357 ears

Answer: 357
