Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Celia plans to spend no more than $100 per week on food for 4 weeks, which is 4 x $100 = $400 total for food.
* Celia plans to spend $1500 on rent for the month.
* Celia plans to spend $30 on video streaming services for the month.
* Celia plans to spend $50 on cell phone usage for the month.
* Adding up all of Celia's planned spending for the month:
    - Food: $400
    - Rent: $1500
    - Video streaming: $30
    - Cell phone: $50
    - Total planned spending: $400 + $1500 + $30 + $50 = $1980
* Celia wants to set aside 10% of her total planned spending for savings.
* 10% of $1980 is 0.10 x $1980 = $198.

Answer: $198
