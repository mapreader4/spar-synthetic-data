Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of ducks: 320

2. First night: 1/4 of the ducks get eaten by a fox.
   * Number of ducks eaten = 1/4 * 320 = 80
   * Remaining ducks = 320 - 80 = 240

3. Second night: 1/6 of the remaining ducks fly away.
   * Number of ducks that fly away = 1/6 * 240 = 40
   * Remaining ducks = 240 - 40 = 200

4. Third night: 30% of the remaining ducks are stolen.
   * Number of ducks stolen = 0.3 * 200 = 60
   * Remaining ducks = 200 - 60 = 140

Answer: 140
