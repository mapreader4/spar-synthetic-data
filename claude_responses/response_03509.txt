Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Scott runs 3 miles every Monday through Wednesday
* That's 3 miles x 3 days = 9 miles per week
* On Thursday and Friday, he runs twice as far as he did on Monday
* So, on Thursday and Friday, he runs 3 miles x 2 = 6 miles each day
* That's 6 miles x 2 days = 12 miles per week
* In a month with 4 weeks, he will run:
* 9 miles per week x 4 weeks = 36 miles
* 12 miles per week x 4 weeks = 48 miles
* Total miles run in a month = 36 miles + 48 miles = 84 miles

Answer: 84 miles
