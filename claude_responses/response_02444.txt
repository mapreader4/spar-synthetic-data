Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The school's fundraising goal is $750
* Families can donate $25, $50, or $100
* With one day left, the school has:
    - 10 Bronze Status families (who donated $25 each)
    - 7 Silver Status families (who donated $50 each) 
    - 1 Gold Status family (who donated $100)
* To calculate the total amount raised so far:
    - 10 Bronze Status families x $25 = $250
    - 7 Silver Status families x $50 = $350
    - 1 Gold Status family x $100 = $100
    - Total raised so far = $250 + $350 + $100 = $700
* To calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the $750 goal:
    - $750 goal - $700 raised so far = $50

Answer: $50
