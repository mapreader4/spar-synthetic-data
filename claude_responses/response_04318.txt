Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mell ordered:
  - 2 cups of coffee at $4 each = 2 x $4 = $8
  - 1 piece of cake at $7 = $7
* Mell's total order = $8 + $7 = $15
* Mell's two friends each ordered:
  - 2 cups of coffee at $4 each = 2 x $4 = $8
  - 1 piece of cake at $7 = $7
  - 1 bowl of ice cream at $3 = $3
* Each friend's total order = $8 + $7 + $3 = $18
* Total for the two friends = 2 x $18 = $36
* Total for Mell and her two friends = $15 + $36 = $51
