Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mark has a bag of 10 dice, and 60% of them are 12-sided.
   * 60% of 10 dice = 0.6 * 10 = 6 dice that are 12-sided

2. James has a bag of 8 dice, and 75% of them are 12-sided.
   * 75% of 8 dice = 0.75 * 8 = 6 dice that are 12-sided

3. The total number of 12-sided dice they have is:
   * Mark's 12-sided dice: 6
   * James' 12-sided dice: 6
   * Total 12-sided dice: 6 + 6 = 12

4. They need a total of 14 12-sided dice to play their game.
   * Dice they need to buy: 14 - 12 = 2
