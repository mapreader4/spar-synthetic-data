Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total number of guests is 80
* 40 of the guests are men
* Half the number of men are women, so the number of women is 20
* The remaining guests are children, so the number of children is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20
* Oleg added 10 children to the guest list
* Therefore, the total number of children at the event is 20 + 10 = 30

Answer: 30
