Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Larry spent $5 for lunch
* He gave his brother $2
* He has $15 now

To find out how much Larry had at the beginning, we need to add the amount he spent and the amount he gave to his brother to the amount he has now.

* Amount spent on lunch: $5
* Amount given to his brother: $2
* Amount he has now: $15

Adding these together:
* $5 + $2 + $15 = $22

Therefore, Larry had $22 at the beginning.

Answer: 22
