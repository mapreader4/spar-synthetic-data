Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cooper makes 7 apple pies a day.
2) He does this for 12 days.
3) So the total number of pies he makes is 7 pies per day x 12 days = 84 pies.
4) Ashley then eats 50 of the pies.
5) So the number of pies remaining with Cooper is the total pies he made (84) minus the pies Ashley ate (50).

Answer: 34 apple pies remain with Cooper.
