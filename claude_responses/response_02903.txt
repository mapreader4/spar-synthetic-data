Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lexie is 8 years old
* Lexie is 6 years older than her brother
* Lexie's sister is twice her age

First, let's find the age of Lexie's brother:
* Lexie is 8 years old
* Lexie is 6 years older than her brother
* Therefore, Lexie's brother is 8 - 6 = 2 years old

Now, let's find the age of Lexie's sister:
* Lexie is 8 years old
* Lexie's sister is twice her age
* Therefore, Lexie's sister is 8 x 2 = 16 years old

Finally, to find the age difference between Lexie's brother and her sister:
* Lexie's brother is 2 years old
* Lexie's sister is 16 years old
* The age difference is 16 - 2 = 14 years
