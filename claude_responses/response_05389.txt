Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nissa takes 10 seconds to clip each of her cat's nails
* The cat has 4 claws on each foot
* So, to clip all of the cat's nails, it would take 4 x 10 = 40 seconds
* Nissa takes 90 seconds to clean each of the cat's ears
* Since the cat has 2 ears, it would take 2 x 90 = 180 seconds to clean both ears
* Nissa takes 5 minutes to shampoo the cat
* 5 minutes is equal to 300 seconds
* To calculate the total time for grooming the cat, we add up the time for clipping the nails, cleaning the ears, and shampooing:
* 40 seconds + 180 seconds + 300 seconds = 520 seconds

Answer: 520 seconds
