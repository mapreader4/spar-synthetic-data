Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 5 dogs in total
* The first dog carried off 3 bones
* The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog, which is 2 bones
* The third dog carried off twice as many bones as the second dog, which is 2 x 2 = 4 bones
* The fourth dog carried off 1 bone
* The fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog, which is 2 x 1 = 2 bones

Now, let's add up the total number of bones carried off:
* 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 12 bones

Therefore, the original pile of bones must have contained 12 bones.

Answer: 12
