Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each band member earns $20 per gig
* There are 4 band members
* The total earnings of the band is $400

To find the number of gigs they have played, we need to divide the total earnings by the total amount earned per gig.

The total amount earned per gig is the number of members (4) multiplied by the amount each member earns per gig ($20):
* Total amount earned per gig = 4 * $20 = $80

Now, we divide the total earnings ($400) by the total amount earned per gig ($80) to get the number of gigs played:
* Number of gigs = $400 / $80 = 5
