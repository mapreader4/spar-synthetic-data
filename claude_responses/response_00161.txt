Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total annual budget for the town is $32 million.
2) Half of the budget goes towards policing, which means $16 million is spent on policing.
3) $12 million goes towards education.
4) To find the amount of money left for managing public spaces, we need to subtract the amounts spent on policing and education from the total budget.
5) $32 million (total budget) - $16 million (policing) - $12 million (education) = $4 million.

Answer: $4 million
