Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alan bought a phone for $2000 online
* John bought the same phone, but 2% more expensive in a local store
* To calculate the price John paid, we need to find 2% of $2000 and add it to the original price

Step 1: Calculate 2% of $2000
* 2% of $2000 = 0.02 x $2000 = $40

Step 2: Add the 2% increase to the original price
* $2000 + $40 = $2040

Therefore, the amount John spent on the phone is:
Answer: $2040
