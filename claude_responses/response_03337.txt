Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill gathered 12 red mushrooms and 6 brown mushrooms
* Ted gathered 14 green mushrooms and 6 blue mushrooms
* Half of the blue mushrooms have white spots
* Two-thirds of the red mushrooms have white spots
* All of the brown mushrooms have white spots

First, let's calculate the number of blue mushrooms with white spots:
* 6 blue mushrooms
* Half of 6 is 3
* So, 3 blue mushrooms have white spots

Next, let's calculate the number of red mushrooms with white spots:
* 12 red mushrooms
* Two-thirds of 12 is 8
* So, 8 red mushrooms have white spots

Finally, let's calculate the number of brown mushrooms with white spots:
* 6 brown mushrooms
* All 6 brown mushrooms have white spots

Now, we can add up the number of white-spotted mushrooms:
* 3 blue mushrooms + 8 red mushrooms + 6 brown mushrooms = 17 white-spotted mushrooms

Answer: 17
