Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janice can type 6 sentences per minute
* She typed for 20 minutes, then took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer
* So the total time she typed before the meeting was 20 + 15 = 35 minutes
* During this time, she typed 6 sentences per minute, so she typed 6 * 35 = 210 sentences
* She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly
* So the number of sentences she had after the initial typing session was 210 - 40 = 170 sentences
* After the meeting, she typed for 18 more minutes
* During this time, she typed 6 * 18 = 108 more sentences
* The total number of sentences in the paper at the end of the day was 536
* So the number of sentences she started with today was 536 - 170 - 108 = 258 sentences

Answer: 258
