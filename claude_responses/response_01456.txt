To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fishes caught by each team member and then add them together.

Given information:
- The competition lasts for 5 days.
- Jackson caught 6 fishes per day.
- Jonah caught 4 fishes per day.
- George caught 8 fishes per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fishes caught by Jackson.
Jackson's total fishes = 6 fishes per day × 5 days = 30 fishes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of fishes caught by Jonah.
Jonah's total fishes = 4 fishes per day × 5 days = 20 fishes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of fishes caught by George.
George's total fishes = 8 fishes per day × 5 days = 40 fishes

Step 4: Calculate the total number of fishes caught by the team.
Total fishes caught by the team = Jackson's total fishes + Jonah's total fishes + George's total fishes
Total fishes caught by the team = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 fishes

Answer: 90 fishes
