Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Erica caught 80 kg of fish in the past four months, not including today
* Today, she caught twice as many fish as she caught in the past four months
* So, if she caught 80 kg in the past four months, she caught 160 kg of fish today (2 x 80 kg)
* In total, she caught 80 kg + 160 kg = 240 kg of fish in the past four months, including today
* Each kg of fish is sold for $20
* To calculate the total money earned, we multiply the total kg of fish by the price per kg:
* 240 kg x $20 per kg = $4,800

Answer: $4,800
