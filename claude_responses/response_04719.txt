Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sid originally had $48 with him.
2) He spent some money on computer accessories, and another $8 on snacks.
3) After these purchases, he had $4 more than half of his original money left.

Let's calculate the amount he had left after the purchases:
* Half of his original $48 is $24.
* He had $4 more than that, so he had $24 + $4 = $28 left.

Now, we can calculate how much he spent on computer accessories:
* He originally had $48.
* He spent $8 on snacks.
* He had $28 left.
* So, the amount he spent on computer accessories must have been:
* $48 - $8 - $28 = $12.

Answer: $12.
