Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Melanie baked 10 batches of brownies, with 20 brownies in each batch. So the total number of brownies baked is 10 * 20 = 200 brownies.
2) She set aside 3/4 of the brownies in each batch for the bake sale. So the number of brownies set aside for the bake sale is 3/4 * 200 = 150 brownies.
3) The remaining 200 - 150 = 50 brownies were not set aside for the bake sale.
4) She put 3/5 of the remaining 50 brownies in a container. So the number of brownies put in the container is 3/5 * 50 = 30 brownies.
5) The remaining 50 - 30 = 20 brownies were given out.

Answer: 20 brownies were given out.
