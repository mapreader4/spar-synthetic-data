Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pizza delivery person has 12 pizzas to deliver
* 2 of the stops are for orders of 2 pizzas each
* The remaining stops are for single pizzas
* The delivery person needs to deliver all 12 pizzas in 40 minutes

First, let's calculate the number of pizzas that are for single orders:
* 12 pizzas total
* 2 stops with 2 pizzas each, so 4 pizzas for those 2 stops
* 12 pizzas total - 4 pizzas for the 2 double orders = 8 pizzas for single orders

Now, let's calculate the number of stops the delivery person needs to make:
* 2 stops for the double orders
* 8 pizzas for single orders, so 8 single order stops

So the total number of stops is 2 + 8 = 10 stops.

To deliver all 12 pizzas in 40 minutes, the delivery person needs to average:
* 40 minutes / 10 stops = 4 minutes per stop
