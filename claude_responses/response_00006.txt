Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Albert buys 2 large pizzas, each with 16 slices
* So the total number of slices from the large pizzas is 2 * 16 = 32 slices
* He also buys 2 small pizzas, each with 8 slices
* So the total number of slices from the small pizzas is 2 * 8 = 16 slices
* To find the total number of slices he eats, we add the slices from the large pizzas and the small pizzas:
* 32 slices + 16 slices = 48 slices

Answer: 48
