Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The fisherman gets 8 Red snappers and 14 Tunas every day.
2) A Red snapper costs $3 and a Tuna costs $2.
3) To calculate the total earnings, we need to find the value of the Red snappers and the Tunas separately, then add them together.
4) For the Red snappers, we have 8 snappers at $3 each, so the total value is:
8 Red snappers x $3 per snapper = $24
5) For the Tunas, we have 14 Tunas at $2 each, so the total value is:
14 Tunas x $2 per Tuna = $28
6) Adding the values of the Red snappers and Tunas together, we get:
$24 + $28 = $52
