Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The age of the lioness is 12 years old.
2) The age of the hyena is half the age of the lioness, since the lioness is twice the age of the hyena.
   * Therefore, the age of the hyena is 12 / 2 = 6 years old.
3) The babies of the two animals are half the age of their mothers.
   * The baby lioness is 12 / 2 = 6 years old.
   * The baby hyena is 6 / 2 = 3 years old.
4) In five years, the ages will be:
   * Lioness: 12 + 5 = 17 years old
   * Hyena: 6 + 5 = 11 years old
   * Baby lioness: 6 + 5 = 11 years old
   * Baby hyena: 3 + 5 = 8 years old
5) The sum of the ages of the babies in five years is:
   * 11 + 8 = 19 years old

Answer: 19
