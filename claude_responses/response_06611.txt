Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary sees 3 breeding balls, each with 8 snakes.
2) To find the total number of snakes in the breeding balls, we multiply 3 (the number of breeding balls) by 8 (the number of snakes in each ball).
3) 3 x 8 = 24 snakes in the breeding balls.
4) Mary also sees 6 additional pairs of snakes.
5) Each pair has 2 snakes, so 6 pairs would have 6 x 2 = 12 additional snakes.
6) To find the total number of snakes Mary saw, we add the 24 snakes from the breeding balls and the 12 additional snakes.
7) 24 + 12 = 36 snakes in total.

Answer: 36
