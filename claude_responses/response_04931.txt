Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each dandelion produces 300 seeds
* 1/3 of the seeds land in water and die
* So, 2/3 of the seeds survive this first step
* 2/3 * 300 = 200 seeds survive
* 1/6 of the starting number (300) are eaten by insects
* 1/6 * 300 = 50 seeds are eaten by insects
* So, 200 - 50 = 150 seeds remain
* Half of the remaining 150 seeds sprout and are immediately eaten
* 150 / 2 = 75 seeds sprout and are eaten
* Therefore, the number of dandelions that survive long enough to flower is the remaining 75 seeds.

Answer: 75
