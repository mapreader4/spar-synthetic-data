Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Veronica carried 27 yellow balls and 33 brown balls to the field.
2) The total number of balls she carried is the sum of the yellow and brown balls: 27 + 33 = 60 balls.
3) To calculate the percentage of yellow balls, we need to divide the number of yellow balls by the total number of balls and multiply by 100.
4) The number of yellow balls is 27, and the total number of balls is 60.
5) The percentage of yellow balls is: (27 / 60) * 100 = 45%.

Answer: 45
