Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The best-selling book, "TOP," costs $8 per book
* The least-selling book, "ABC," costs $23 per book
* Last week, 13 "TOP" books were sold
* Last week, 4 "ABC" books were sold

To calculate the earnings on the "TOP" books:
* 13 "TOP" books were sold
* Each "TOP" book costs $8
* So the total earnings on "TOP" books = 13 * $8 = $104

To calculate the earnings on the "ABC" books:
* 4 "ABC" books were sold
* Each "ABC" book costs $23
* So the total earnings on "ABC" books = 4 * $23 = $92

Now, to find the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week, we subtract the earnings on "ABC" books from the earnings on "TOP" books:
* $104 - $92 = $12

Answer: $12
