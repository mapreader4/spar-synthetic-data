Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jim's gas tank holds 12 gallons.
2) After driving to and from work, which is 10 miles away, he has 2/3 of a tank left.
3) To find how much gas he used, we need to find how much is 1/3 of a tank. 1/3 of 12 gallons is 4 gallons.
4) So, Jim used 4 gallons of gas to drive 10 miles to and from work.
5) To find the miles per gallon, we divide the total miles driven by the amount of gas used: 10 miles / 4 gallons = 2.5 miles per gallon.

Answer: 2.5 miles per gallon.
