Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has 2 umbrellas in his house
* John has 1 umbrella in his car
* Each umbrella costs $8
* To calculate the total amount John paid, we need to multiply the number of umbrellas by the cost per umbrella and add them together.

The number of umbrellas in the house is 2, and the cost per umbrella is $8.
* 2 umbrellas x $8 per umbrella = $16

The number of umbrellas in the car is 1, and the cost per umbrella is $8.
* 1 umbrella x $8 per umbrella = $8

Now we add the two amounts together to get the total:
* $16 + $8 = $24
