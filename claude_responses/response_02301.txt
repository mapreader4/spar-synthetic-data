Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 10 snowflakes
* It snowed an additional 4 snowflakes every 5 minutes
* We need to find how many minutes passed before there were 58 snowflakes

To do this, we need to find how many sets of 4 snowflakes were added to the initial 10 snowflakes to reach 58 snowflakes.

* 58 snowflakes - 10 initial snowflakes = 48 additional snowflakes
* 48 additional snowflakes / 4 snowflakes per 5 minutes = 12 sets of 5 minutes

Therefore, 12 sets of 5 minutes = 60 minutes passed before there were 58 snowflakes.

Answer: 60
