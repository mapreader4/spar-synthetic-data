Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The new pad of paper has 120 pages.
2) Sammy uses 25% of the pages for his science project.
   * 25% of 120 pages = 0.25 * 120 = 30 pages
3) Sammy uses another 10 pages for his math homework.
4) To calculate the number of pages remaining, we take the total pages (120) and subtract the pages used for the science project (30) and the math homework (10).
   * 120 - 30 - 10 = 80 pages
Answer: 80
