Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The ash cloud spreads out in a diameter eighteen times as far as the distance it shot up into the sky.
* The ash erupted 300 feet into the sky.
* To find the radius of the ash cloud, we need to find the diameter and then divide it by 2.
* The diameter of the ash cloud is 18 times the distance it shot up into the sky.
* So the diameter of the ash cloud is 18 * 300 = 5,400 feet.
* The radius of the ash cloud is the diameter divided by 2, which is 5,400 / 2 = 2,700 feet.

Answer: 2,700
