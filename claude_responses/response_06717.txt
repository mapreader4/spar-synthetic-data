Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet.
2) Peter's current age is half of his mother's age, who is 60.
   * Peter's current age = 60 / 2 = 30
3) In four years, Peter will be 30 + 4 = 34 years old.
4) Since Peter will be twice as old as Harriet in four years, we can say that Harriet's age in four years will be 34 / 2 = 17.
5) Therefore, Harriet's current age is 17 - 4 = 13.
