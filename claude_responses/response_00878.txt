Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Santino has 2 papaya trees
* Each papaya tree produces 10 papayas
* So, the total number of papayas Santino has is:
  * 2 papaya trees x 10 papayas per tree = 20 papayas
* Santino has 3 mango trees
* Each mango tree produces 20 mangos
* So, the total number of mangos Santino has is:
  * 3 mango trees x 20 mangos per tree = 60 mangos
* To get the total number of fruits Santino has, we add the number of papayas and mangos:
  * 20 papayas + 60 mangos = 80 fruits

Answer: 80
