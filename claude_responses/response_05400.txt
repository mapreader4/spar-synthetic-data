Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Max sold 24 candy bars.
2) Seth sold 6 more candy bars than 3 times the number of candy bars that Max sold.
3) To find the number of candy bars Seth sold, we first need to find 3 times the number of candy bars that Max sold.
4) 3 times the number of candy bars that Max sold = 3 * 24 = 72 candy bars.
5) Seth sold 6 more candy bars than 72, so Seth sold 72 + 6 = 78 candy bars.

Answer: 78
