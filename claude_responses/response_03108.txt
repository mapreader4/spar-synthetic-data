Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Annie has $120 to start with.
* The restaurant next door sells hamburgers for $4 each.
* Annie buys 8 hamburgers.
* So the cost of the 8 hamburgers is 8 x $4 = $32.
* The restaurant across the street sells milkshakes for $3 each.
* Annie buys 6 milkshakes.
* So the cost of the 6 milkshakes is 6 x $3 = $18.
* The total amount Annie spent is $32 (for the hamburgers) + $18 (for the milkshakes) = $50.
* Annie started with $120, and she spent $50, so the amount of money she has left is $120 - $50 = $70.

Answer: $70
