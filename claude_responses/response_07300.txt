Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. John's neighbor pays him $10 for walking his dog for 1 hour each day.
2. There are 30 days in April, but John doesn't walk the dog on the 4 Sundays.
3. So, John walks the dog for 26 days in April.
4. 26 days x $10 per day = $260 that John earned from walking the dog.

5. John then spent $50 on books.
6. He also gave his sister Kaylee the same amount, which is another $50.

7. To calculate the amount of money John had left, we need to take the total amount he earned ($260) and subtract the amount he spent on books ($50) and the amount he gave to his sister ($50).

Answer: $160
