Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michelle needs 2 cups of flour to make 1 pound of pasta dough
* She has 3 8-cup bags of flour, which is 3 * 8 = 24 cups of flour
* So, the total amount of pasta dough she can make is 24 cups / 2 cups per pound = 12 pounds of pasta dough
* She needs 1 drying rack for every 3 pounds of pasta
* So, the number of drying racks she needs is 12 pounds / 3 pounds per rack = 4 racks
* She currently owns 3 racks
* Therefore, the number of additional racks she needs is 4 racks - 3 racks = 1 rack
