Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Isabella earns $5 per hour babysitting
* She babysits 5 hours every day
* She babysits 6 afternoons per week
* She babysits for 7 weeks

First, let's calculate how much she earns per day:
* 5 hours per day x $5 per hour = $25 per day

Next, let's calculate how much she earns per week:
* 6 afternoons per week x $25 per day = $150 per week

Finally, let's calculate how much she earns in 7 weeks:
* $150 per week x 7 weeks = $1,050

Answer: $1,050
