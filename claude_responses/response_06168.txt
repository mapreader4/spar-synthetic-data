Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are initially 50 apples and 40 oranges in the cafeteria
* Each apple costs $0.80 and each orange costs $0.50
* There are now 10 apples and 6 oranges left
* To calculate the total earnings, we need to find the number of apples and oranges that were sold, and then multiply them by their respective prices.

The number of apples sold:
* Initially there were 50 apples
* Now there are 10 apples left
* So the number of apples sold is 50 - 10 = 40 apples

The number of oranges sold:
* Initially there were 40 oranges
* Now there are 6 oranges left
* So the number of oranges sold is 40 - 6 = 34 oranges

The total earnings from the apples:
* 40 apples were sold at $0.80 each
* 40 x $0.80 = $32

The total earnings from the oranges:
* 34 oranges were sold at $0.50 each
* 34 x $0.50 = $17

The total earnings from apples and oranges:
* $32 + $17 = $49

Answer: $49
