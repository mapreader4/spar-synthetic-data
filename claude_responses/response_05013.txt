Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 50 staplers in the stapler initially.
* Stacie staples 3 dozen reports on her desk.
* 1 dozen = 12 reports.
* So, 3 dozen = 3 x 12 = 36 reports.
* Each report requires 1 staple.
* Therefore, Stacie used 36 staplers.
* To find the number of staplers left in the stapler, we subtract the number of staplers used from the initial number of staplers.
* 50 staplers - 36 staplers used = 14 staplers left.

Answer: 14
