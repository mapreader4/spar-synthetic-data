Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes Dawn 2 hours to paint 1 watercolor painting
* She was commissioned to paint a series of 12 paintings
* She will earn $3,600.00 for these 12 paintings

To find out how much money Dawn makes per hour, we need to first calculate the total time it takes her to paint all 12 paintings.
* Since it takes her 2 hours to paint 1 painting, it will take her 2 hours x 12 paintings = 24 hours to paint all 12 paintings.

Now, we can calculate her hourly rate by dividing the total amount she will earn ($3,600.00) by the total number of hours it takes her to complete the 12 paintings (24 hours).
* $3,600.00 / 24 hours = $150.00 per hour

Answer: $150.00
