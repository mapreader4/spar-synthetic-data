Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Before the injury, James was able to run 100 miles per week.
* He wants to get up to 20% more than that total in 280 days.
* 20% of 100 miles is 20 miles.
* So his new goal is to run 100 + 20 = 120 miles per week.
* He plans to increase his miles walked by the same amount each week to reach this goal.
* To calculate the amount he needs to add per week, we take the difference between the new goal and the original amount, and divide it by the number of weeks:
* 120 miles - 100 miles = 20 miles
* 280 days / 7 days per week = 40 weeks
* 20 miles / 40 weeks = 0.5 miles per week

Answer: 0.5 miles
