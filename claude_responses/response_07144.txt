Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The initial price of the iPhone was $1000.
2) In the first month, the price fell by 10%. To calculate the new price, we take the initial price and subtract 10% of it:
   $1000 - (10% of $1000) = $1000 - $100 = $900
3) In the second month, the price fell by another 20%. To calculate the new price, we take the price from the first month and subtract 20% of it:
   $900 - (20% of $900) = $900 - $180 = $720
Answer: $720
