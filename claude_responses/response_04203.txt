Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kyle's monthly income is $3200.00
* His monthly bills include:
  - Rent: $1250
  - Utilities: $150
  - Retirement & Savings: $400
  - Groceries/Eating Out: $300
  - Insurance: $200
  - Miscellaneous: $200
* Adding up all these monthly bills, we get:
  $1250 + $150 + $400 + $300 + $200 + $200 = $2500
* So, his remaining income after paying his bills is:
  $3200 - $2500 = $700
* He is now looking to add a car payment of $350 per month.
* Subtracting the car payment from his remaining income, we get:
  $700 - $350 = $350

Answer: $350
