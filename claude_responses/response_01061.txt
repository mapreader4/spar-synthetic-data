Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John Smith buys 3 cakes
* Each cake costs $12
* So the total cost of the 3 cakes is:
    - 3 cakes x $12 per cake = $36
* John Smith splits the cost with his brother
* To find how much John Smith paid, we divide the total cost by 2:
    - $36 / 2 = $18

Answer: $18
