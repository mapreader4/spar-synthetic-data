Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Janice needs to finish her homework, which takes 30 minutes.
2. Cleaning her room takes half as long as her homework, which is 15 minutes.
3. Walking the dog takes 5 minutes more than making homework, which is 35 minutes.
4. Taking out the trash takes 1/6 of the time it takes her to do the homework, which is 5 minutes.

Now, we add up all the tasks:
* Homework: 30 minutes
* Cleaning room: 15 minutes
* Walking the dog: 35 minutes
* Taking out the trash: 5 minutes

Total time for all tasks: 30 + 15 + 35 + 5 = 85 minutes

Janice has 2 hours (120 minutes) before the movie starts.
So, the time she has left before the movie starts is:
* 120 minutes - 85 minutes = 35 minutes

Answer: 35
