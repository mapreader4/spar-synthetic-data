Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Selene bought two instant cameras at $110 each.
   * Total cost of the instant cameras = 2 x $110 = $220

2. Selene bought three digital photo frames at $120 each.
   * Total cost of the digital photo frames = 3 x $120 = $360

3. The total cost of all the items before the discount is:
   * Total cost = $220 + $360 = $580

4. Selene gets a 5% discount on all the items.
   * Discount amount = 5% of $580 = 0.05 x $580 = $29

5. The total amount Selene pays after the discount is:
   * Total amount paid = $580 - $29 = $551

Answer: 551
