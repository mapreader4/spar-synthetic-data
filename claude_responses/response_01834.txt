Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jimmy stays in a hostel for the first 3 days
* He is charged $15 per night at the hostel
* So for the first 3 days, the total cost is:
  * 3 nights x $15 per night = $45
* For the fourth and fifth days, he stays in a cabin and shares the expenses with 2 of his friends
* The total charge for the cabin is $45 per night
* Since he is sharing the expenses with 2 friends, Jimmy's share is 1/3 of the total, which is $15 per night
* So for the fourth and fifth days, the total cost for Jimmy is:
  * 2 nights x $15 per night = $30
* To calculate the total amount Jimmy spent on lodging, we add the costs for the first 3 days and the fourth and fifth days:
  * $45 + $30 = $75

Answer: 75
