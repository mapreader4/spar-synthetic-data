Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Olga has 3 stripes on each of her tennis shoes
* Rick has 1 less stripe per shoe than Olga, so Rick has 2 stripes per shoe
* Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as Olga, so Hortense has 6 stripes per shoe

Now, let's calculate the total number of stripes:
* Olga has 2 shoes, each with 3 stripes, so Olga has 6 stripes total
* Rick has 2 shoes, each with 2 stripes, so Rick has 4 stripes total
* Hortense has 2 shoes, each with 6 stripes, so Hortense has 12 stripes total

To get the combined total, we add up the stripes for each person:
6 + 4 + 12 = 22

Answer: 22
