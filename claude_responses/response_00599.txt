Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John paid with:
  - 4 quarters = 4 x $0.25 = $1.00
  - 3 dimes = 3 x $0.10 = $0.30
  - 1 nickel = 1 x $0.05 = $0.05
* Total amount paid = $1.00 + $0.30 + $0.05 = $1.35
* John received 4 cents back in change
* Therefore, the cost of the candy bar must have been $1.35 - $0.04 = $1.31

Answer: 131 cents
