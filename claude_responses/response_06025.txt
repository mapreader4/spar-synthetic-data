Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kendra has 4 packs of pens
* Each pack has 3 pens
* So Kendra has 4 x 3 = 12 pens
* Tony has 2 packs of pens
* Each pack has 3 pens
* So Tony has 2 x 3 = 6 pens
* Together, Kendra and Tony have 12 + 6 = 18 pens
* They each decide to keep 2 pens
* So they have 18 - 2 - 2 = 14 pens left to give to their friends
* They will give one pen per friend
* Therefore, the number of friends they will give pens to is 14.

Answer: 14
