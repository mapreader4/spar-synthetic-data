Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pulsar stands on his back legs for 10 minutes
* Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar
* To find how long Polly stands on her back legs, we multiply Pulsar's time by 3:
   * 10 minutes x 3 = 30 minutes
* Petra stands on his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly
* To find how long Petra stands on his back legs, we divide Polly's time by 6:
   * 30 minutes / 6 = 5 minutes
* To find the combined length of time that the three entertainers stand on their back legs, we add up the individual times:
   * Pulsar: 10 minutes
   * Polly: 30 minutes
   * Petra: 5 minutes
   * Total: 10 + 30 + 5 = 45 minutes

Answer: 45 minutes
