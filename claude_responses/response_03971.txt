Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mona bikes 30 miles each week to stay fit
* This week, she biked on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday
* On Wednesday, she biked 12 miles
* On Saturday, she biked twice as far as on Monday

We can use this information to find the number of miles she biked on Monday.

First, we know that the total number of miles she biked this week is 30 miles.

Next, we know that on Wednesday she biked 12 miles, and on Saturday she biked twice as far as on Monday. 

So, let's call the number of miles she biked on Monday 'x'.
* On Saturday, she biked 2x miles.
* The total number of miles she biked this week is 12 + x + 2x = 30 miles.
* Solving for x, we get: 12 + 3x = 30
* 3x = 18
* x = 6

Therefore, Mona biked 6 miles on Monday.
