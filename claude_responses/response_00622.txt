Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anne's female cat weighs 2 kilograms
* The male cat is two times heavier than the female cat
* To find the weight of the male cat, we multiply the female cat's weight by 2:
    * 2 kg x 2 = 4 kg
* Now, to find the total weight Anne is carrying, we add the weights of the two cats:
    * 2 kg (female cat) + 4 kg (male cat) = 6 kg

Answer: 6 kilograms
