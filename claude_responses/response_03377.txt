Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kyle goes to basketball practice every day for 2 hours
* He spends half of the time shooting
* The remaining time is spent running and weight lifting
* He runs for twice the time he spends weight lifting

First, let's calculate the total time he spends on practice:
* 2 hours = 120 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time he spends shooting:
* He spends half the time shooting
* 120 minutes / 2 = 60 minutes

The remaining time is spent running and weight lifting:
* 120 minutes - 60 minutes = 60 minutes

We know that he runs for twice the time he spends weight lifting, so let's call the time he spends weight lifting "x" minutes.
* Running time = 2x minutes
* Total remaining time = 60 minutes
* 2x + x = 60
* 3x = 60
* x = 20 minutes

Answer: 20 minutes
