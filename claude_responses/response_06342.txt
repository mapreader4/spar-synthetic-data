Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The big box store sees 175 people enter their store every hour.
2) During the holiday season, this number doubles, so the store sees 175 * 2 = 350 people enter per hour.
3) We want to know how many customers the store will see in 8 hours during the holiday season.
4) To calculate this, we take the number of people entering per hour (350) and multiply it by the number of hours (8).
5) 350 people per hour * 8 hours = 2,800 customers.

Answer: 2,800
