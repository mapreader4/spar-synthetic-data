Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kevin has a shoebox filled with toads
* Each toad is fed 3 worms per day
* It takes Kevin 15 minutes to find each worm
* It takes Kevin 6 hours to find enough worms to feed all of his toads

First, let's calculate how many worms Kevin needs to find in total:
* 6 hours = 360 minutes
* 360 minutes / 15 minutes per worm = 24 worms per day

Now, let's calculate how many toads Kevin has in his shoebox:
* 24 worms per day / 3 worms per toad = 8 toads per day
* Since it takes Kevin 6 hours to find enough worms to feed all of his toads, he must have 8 toads in his shoebox.

Answer: 8
