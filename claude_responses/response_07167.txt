Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maria starts with 19 cookies.
2) She gives 5 cookies to her friend, so now she has 19 - 5 = 14 cookies.
3) She then gives half of the remaining cookies to her family. Half of 14 is 7, so she gives 7 cookies to her family, leaving her with 14 - 7 = 7 cookies.
4) Finally, she eats 2 cookies, leaving her with 7 - 2 = 5 cookies.
