Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister. This means that if Anne is 80cm tall, her sister must be 80cm / 2 = 40cm tall.
2) Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne. This means that if Anne is 80cm tall, Bella must be 80cm * 3 = 240cm tall.
3) To find the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister, we subtract the height of Anne's sister from the height of Bella:
Bella's height - Anne's sister's height = 240cm - 40cm = 200cm.

Answer: 200
