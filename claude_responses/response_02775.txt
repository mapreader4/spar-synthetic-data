Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jack's head circumference is 12 inches.
2. Charlie's head circumference is 9 inches more than half the circumference of Jack's head.
   - Half of Jack's head circumference is 12 / 2 = 6 inches.
   - Charlie's head circumference is 6 + 9 = 15 inches.
3. Bill's head circumference is 2/3 the circumference of Charlie's head.
   - Charlie's head circumference is 15 inches.
   - Bill's head circumference is 2/3 * 15 = 10 inches.

Answer: 10 inches
