Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Karen starts with 20 pounds of water, 10 pounds of food, and 20 pounds of gear
* During the hike, she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour
* She eats 1/3rd the weight of water per hour, which is 2/3 pounds of food per hour
* The hike lasts for 6 hours

First, let's calculate the water consumption:
* Water consumed in 6 hours = 2 pounds per hour x 6 hours = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the food consumption:
* Food consumed in 6 hours = 2/3 pounds per hour x 6 hours = 4 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight she is carrying after 6 hours:
* Initial weight = 20 pounds water + 10 pounds food + 20 pounds gear = 50 pounds
* Weight consumed = 12 pounds water + 4 pounds food = 16 pounds
* Final weight = 50 pounds - 16 pounds = 34 pounds

Answer: 34 pounds
