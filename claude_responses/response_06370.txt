Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The mechanic charges $60 per hour.
2) He works 8 hours per day for 14 days on one car.
3) So the total number of hours worked is 8 hours x 14 days = 112 hours.
4) The total labor cost is 112 hours x $60 per hour = $6,720.
5) The mechanic also used $2,500 in parts.
6) Therefore, the total cost the car's owner had to pay is the labor cost ($6,720) plus the parts cost ($2,500).

Answer: $9,220
