Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sandra's dog gave birth to 7 puppies
* The vet gave Sandra 105 portions of formula
* The puppies need to be fed for 5 days

To find out how many times a day Sandra should feed the puppies, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of portions the puppies need for 5 days
2. Divide the total number of portions by the number of puppies to get the portions per puppy
3. Divide the portions per puppy by the number of days to get the portions per puppy per day

Step 1: Total portions needed for 5 days
* 7 puppies x 5 days = 35 total puppy-days
* 35 total puppy-days x 3 portions per day = 105 total portions needed

Step 2: Portions per puppy
* 105 total portions / 7 puppies = 15 portions per puppy

Step 3: Portions per puppy per day
* 15 portions per puppy / 5 days = 3 portions per puppy per day

Therefore, Sandra should feed the puppies 3 times a day.
