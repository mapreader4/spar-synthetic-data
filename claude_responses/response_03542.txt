Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The library charges 50 cents per day for any book borrowed
* Celine borrowed 3 books at the start of May
* She returned 1 book 20 days after borrowing it
* The other 2 books stayed at her house until the end of May (31 days)

For the 1 book returned after 20 days:
* 50 cents per day x 20 days = $10

For the 2 books that stayed until the end of May:
* 50 cents per day x 31 days x 2 books = $31 x 2 = $62

To calculate the total amount Celine paid:
* $10 + $62 = $72

Answer: $72
