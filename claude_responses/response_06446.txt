Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The family started with a 24 pack of bottled water.
2) On the first day, they drank 1/3 of the 24 bottles, which is 8 bottles (24 * 1/3 = 8).
3) After the first day, there were 24 - 8 = 16 bottles remaining.
4) On the second day, they drank 1/2 of the 16 bottles remaining, which is 8 bottles (16 * 1/2 = 8).
5) After the second day, there were 16 - 8 = 8 bottles remaining.

Answer: 8
