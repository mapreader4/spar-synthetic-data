Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brody's calculator can run for 60 hours on a full battery
* Brody has used three quarters of the battery up
* He is about to take a two-hour math exam that will require the calculator the whole time

To find how many hours of battery will be left, we need to:
1. Calculate how much battery has been used up so far
2. Subtract the amount of battery used during the two-hour exam from the remaining battery

Step 1: Calculating the amount of battery used up so far
* Brody has used three quarters of the battery up
* Three quarters of 60 hours is 45 hours
* So, 45 hours of battery has been used up so far

Step 2: Subtracting the amount of battery used during the two-hour exam from the remaining battery
* Brody has 60 hours of battery on a full charge
* He has used 45 hours of battery so far
* That means he has 15 hours of battery remaining (60 hours - 45 hours)
* He will use 2 hours of battery during the exam
* So, he will have 13 hours of battery left after the exam (15 hours - 2 hours)

Answer: 13 hours
