Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The box can hold 40 pounds of cookies
* Each cookie weighs 2 ounces
* We need to convert the weight limit of the box from pounds to ounces
* 1 pound = 16 ounces
* 40 pounds = 40 * 16 = 640 ounces
* Each cookie weighs 2 ounces
* So the maximum number of cookies that can fit in the box is 640 ounces / 2 ounces per cookie = 320 cookies

Answer: 320
