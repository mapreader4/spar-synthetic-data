Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adam's father deposited $2000 in the bank.
2) The bank pays 8% interest on the deposit throughout the year.
3) Adam's father withdraws the interest as soon as it is deposited.
4) We need to calculate the total amount Adam's father will have after 2 and a half years.

To calculate the interest received each year:
* Year 1: $2000 x 0.08 = $160 in interest
* Year 2: $2000 x 0.08 = $160 in interest
* Half of Year 3: $2000 x 0.08 x 0.5 = $80 in interest

So the total interest received over 2 and a half years is:
$160 + $160 + $80 = $400

Now, we add the original deposit of $2000 to the total interest received:
$2000 + $400 = $2400

Answer: $2400
