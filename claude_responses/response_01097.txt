Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Javier baked 200 cookies.
2. His wife took 30% of the 200 cookies. 30% of 200 is 0.3 * 200 = 60 cookies.
3. After his wife took 60 cookies, there were 200 - 60 = 140 cookies remaining.
4. His daughter then took 40 cookies from the remaining 140.
5. After his daughter took 40 cookies, there were 140 - 40 = 100 cookies remaining.
6. Javier then ate half of the remaining 100 cookies. Half of 100 is 50 cookies.
7. The total number of cookies that were not eaten is the number of cookies remaining after Javier ate his share, which is 100 - 50 = 50 cookies.

Answer: 50
