Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 kids waiting for the swings
* There are twice as many kids waiting for the slide, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 kids waiting for the slide
* Each kid waits 2 minutes for the swings, which is 2 x 60 = 120 seconds
* Each kid waits 15 seconds for the slide
* The total wait time for the swings is 3 kids x 120 seconds = 360 seconds
* The total wait time for the slide is 6 kids x 15 seconds = 90 seconds
* The difference between the two wait times is 360 seconds - 90 seconds = 270 seconds

Answer: 270 seconds
