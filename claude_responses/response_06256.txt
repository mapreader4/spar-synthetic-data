Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The old league record is an average score per player of 287 per round
* Each team has 4 players
* There are 10 rounds in the season
* Through the first 9 rounds, George's team has scored a total of 10,440 points

To calculate the minimum average they need to score per player in the final round to tie the league record, we need to:
1. Calculate the total points needed to tie the league record
2. Subtract the points they've already scored
3. Divide the remaining points needed by the number of players and the number of rounds

Step 1: Calculate the total points needed to tie the league record
* Old record average per player per round = 287
* Number of players per team = 4
* Number of rounds = 10
* Total points needed to tie the league record = 287 * 4 * 10 = 11,480

Step 2: Subtract the points they've already scored
* Points already scored = 10,440
* Remaining points needed = 11,480 - 10,440 = 1,040

Step 3: Divide the remaining points needed by the number of players and the number of rounds
* Remaining points needed = 1,040
* Number of players = 4
* Number of rounds = 1
* Minimum average needed per player in the final round = 1,040 / 4 = 260

Therefore, the minimum average they need to score per player in the final round to tie the league record is 260 points.
