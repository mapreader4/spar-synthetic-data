Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Diane is currently 16 years old
* When Diane turns 30, she will be half the age of Alex
* When Diane turns 30, she will be twice as old as Allison
* So, when Diane is 30, Alex will be 60 (twice Diane's age)
* And when Diane is 30, Allison will be 15 (half Diane's age)
* Therefore, the current ages of Alex and Allison are:
* Alex's current age = 60 - 14 = 46
* Allison's current age = 15 - 14 = 1

To find the sum of their current ages:
* Alex's current age: 46
* Allison's current age: 1
* Sum of their ages: 46 + 1 = 47

Answer: 47
