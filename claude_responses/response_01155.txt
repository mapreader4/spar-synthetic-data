Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Greta's turtle finished the race in 6 minutes.
* George's turtle finished 2 minutes quicker than Greta's, so George's turtle finished in 6 - 2 = 4 minutes.
* Gloria's turtle took twice as long as George's turtle, so Gloria's turtle took 4 x 2 = 8 minutes to finish the race.
