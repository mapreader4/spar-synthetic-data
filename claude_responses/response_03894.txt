Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony's car gets 25 miles per gallon
* He drives 50 miles round trip to work, 5 days a week
* So, in 1 week, he drives 50 miles x 5 days = 250 miles
* His tank holds 10 gallons
* He begins the week with a full tank, and when he runs out, he fills up at $2 per gallon

To calculate how much gas he needs in 1 week:
* 250 miles / 25 miles per gallon = 10 gallons

Since he starts with a full tank, he will need to fill up once a week.
* 10 gallons x $2 per gallon = $20 per week

For 4 weeks, the total cost would be:
* $20 per week x 4 weeks = $80

Answer: $80
