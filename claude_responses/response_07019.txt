Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The productivity in the Tutuwanas saw-mill increased by 1.5 this year
* This increase was due to the Albaszu machine being repaired
* Before the repair, the Albaszu machine was cutting 10 trees daily
* After the repair, the productivity of the Albaszu machine has increased by 1.5

To find the number of trees the Albaszu machine is cutting now, we can use the following calculation:
* Original number of trees cut daily: 10
* Increase in productivity: 1.5
* New number of trees cut daily = Original number of trees cut daily * (1 + Increase in productivity)
* New number of trees cut daily = 10 * (1 + 1.5)
* New number of trees cut daily = 10 * 2.5
* New number of trees cut daily = 25

Answer: 25
