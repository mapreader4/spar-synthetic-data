Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ben started with 20 eggs in the fridge
* Yesterday, he ate 4 eggs in the morning
* Yesterday, he ate 3 eggs in the afternoon
* So, the total number of eggs he ate yesterday is 4 + 3 = 7 eggs
* To find the number of eggs he has now, we take the original 20 eggs and subtract the 7 eggs he ate:
* 20 eggs - 7 eggs = 13 eggs
