Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* For breakfast, Anna bought a bagel for $0.95 and a glass of orange juice for $0.85.
* The total cost of Anna's breakfast is $0.95 + $0.85 = $1.80.
* At lunch, Anna spent $4.65 on a sandwich and $1.15 on a carton of milk.
* The total cost of Anna's lunch is $4.65 + $1.15 = $5.80.
* To find how much more money Anna spent on lunch than on breakfast, we subtract the cost of breakfast from the cost of lunch:
* $5.80 - $1.80 = $4.00.
