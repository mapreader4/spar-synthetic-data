Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) From 2pm to 4pm, it rained at a rate of 4 inches per hour for 2 hours. So the amount of rain during this period is:
4 inches/hour x 2 hours = 8 inches
2) From 4pm to 7pm, it rained at a rate of 3 inches per hour for 3 hours. So the amount of rain during this period is:
3 inches/hour x 3 hours = 9 inches
3) From 7pm to 9pm, it rained at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour for 2 hours. So the amount of rain during this period is:
0.5 inches/hour x 2 hours = 1 inch
4) The rain gauge started out the day with 2 inches of rainwater.
5) Adding up the amounts of rain:
8 inches + 9 inches + 1 inch = 18 inches
6) Adding the initial 2 inches of rainwater:
18 inches + 2 inches = 20 inches

Answer: 20 inches
