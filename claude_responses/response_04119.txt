Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. In the first month, Grant made $350.

2. In the second month, he made $50 more than double what he made in the first month.
   * First month's earnings: $350
   * Double of first month's earnings: $350 x 2 = $700
   * $50 more than $700: $700 + $50 = $750

3. In the third month, he quadrupled the sum of the first two months.
   * First month's earnings: $350
   * Second month's earnings: $750
   * Sum of first two months: $350 + $750 = $1,100
   * Quadrupled sum: $1,100 x 4 = $4,400

Now, to calculate the total amount Grant made in his first three months:
* First month: $350
* Second month: $750
* Third month: $4,400
* Total: $350 + $750 + $4,400 = $5,500

Answer: $5,500
