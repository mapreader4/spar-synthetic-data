Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The shop sells laptops at $600 each
* The shop sells smartphones at $400 each
* Celine buys:
  - 2 laptops
  - 4 smartphones
* To calculate the total cost of her purchase:
  - 2 laptops at $600 each = $1,200
  - 4 smartphones at $400 each = $1,600
  - Total cost = $1,200 + $1,600 = $2,800
* Celine has $3,000
* To calculate the change she gets back:
  - Change = $3,000 - $2,800 = $200

Answer: 200
