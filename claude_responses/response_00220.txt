Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles
* This means the car's fuel efficiency is 20 gallons / 400 miles = 0.05 gallons per mile
* Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons of gas in it
* To travel 600 miles, the car will need:
    - 600 miles * 0.05 gallons/mile = 30 gallons of gas
* Since Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons, he needs:
    - 30 gallons - 8 gallons = 22 more gallons of gas

Answer: 22
