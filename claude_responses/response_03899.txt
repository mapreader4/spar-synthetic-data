Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 56 pieces of fruit in the box.
2) One-fourth of the box contains oranges. So, the number of oranges is 56 * 1/4 = 14 oranges.
3) There are half as many peaches as oranges. So, the number of peaches is 14 / 2 = 7 peaches.
4) There are five times as many apples as peaches. So, the number of apples is 7 * 5 = 35 apples.

Answer: 35
