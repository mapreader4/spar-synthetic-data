Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kat spends 1 hour in the gym 3 times a week for strength training
* 1 hour x 3 times a week = 3 hours per week for strength training
* Kat also trains at the boxing gym 4 times a week for 1.5 hours each time
* 1.5 hours x 4 times a week = 6 hours per week for boxing training
* To calculate the total hours per week, we add the hours for strength training and boxing training:
* 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours per week

Answer: 9 hours
