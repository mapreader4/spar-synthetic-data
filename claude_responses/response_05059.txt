Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James had 200 toys.
2) He sold 80% of the toys, which means he sold 0.8 * 200 = 160 toys.
3) He bought each toy for $20, so the total cost of the 200 toys was 200 * $20 = $4,000.
4) He sold each toy for $30, so the total revenue from selling 160 toys was 160 * $30 = $4,800.
5) The difference between the total revenue and the total cost is the amount of money he made:
$4,800 - $4,000 = $800.

Answer: $800
