Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Henry has 30 more lollipops than Alison, so if Alison has 60 lollipops, then Henry has 60 + 30 = 90 lollipops.
2) Alison has half the number of lollipops that Diane has, so Diane has 60 x 2 = 120 lollipops.
3) The total number of lollipops they have is 60 + 90 + 120 = 270 lollipops.
4) They eat 45 lollipops each day, so the total number of days it will take to finish the lollipops is 270 / 45 = 6 days.
