Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The initial speed of the spaceship with 200 people on board is 500 km/hr.
2) For every 100 additional people that board the spaceship, its speed is halved.
3) The question states that there are 400 people on board the spaceship.
4) The difference between 400 people and 200 people is 200 people.
5) Since the speed is halved for every 100 additional people, with 200 additional people, the speed will be halved twice.
6) Halving the speed of 500 km/hr twice gives us a speed of 125 km/hr.

Answer: 125 km/hr
