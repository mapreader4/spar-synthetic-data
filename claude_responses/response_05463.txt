Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ms. Perez's class has 30 students
* Half the students in Ms. Perez's class collected 12 cans each
* Half of 30 is 15 students
* 15 students collected 12 cans each, so that's 15 x 12 = 180 cans
* 2 students didn't collect any cans
* The remaining 13 students each collected 4 cans, so that's 13 x 4 = 52 cans
* To get the total cans collected, we add the cans from the 15 students who collected 12 each, and the cans from the 13 students who collected 4 each:
* 180 + 52 = 232 cans

Answer: 232
