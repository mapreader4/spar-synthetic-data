Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first dog eats 1.5 cups of dog food per day.
2) The second dog eats twice as much as the first dog, which is 2 x 1.5 = 3 cups per day.
3) The third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog, which is 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 cups per day.
4) To find the total amount of dog food Hannah should prepare in a day, we add up the amounts for each dog:
1.5 cups + 3 cups + 5.5 cups = 10 cups.

Answer: 10 cups
