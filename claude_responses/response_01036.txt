Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alia has 2 times as many markers as Austin.
2) Austin has one-third as many markers as Steve.
3) Steve has 60 markers.
4) Since Austin has one-third as many markers as Steve, and Steve has 60 markers, we can calculate that Austin has 60 / 3 = 20 markers.
5) Since Alia has 2 times as many markers as Austin, and Austin has 20 markers, we can calculate that Alia has 2 * 20 = 40 markers.

Answer: 40
