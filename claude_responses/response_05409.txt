Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bruce's aunt gave him $71 to spend on clothes at the mall.
2) He bought 5 shirts that cost $5 each. So the total cost of the 5 shirts is 5 x $5 = $25.
3) He also bought a pair of pants that cost $26.
4) To calculate the total amount he spent, we add the cost of the shirts and the pants: $25 + $26 = $51.
5) To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent ($51) from the amount his aunt gave him ($71): $71 - $51 = $20.

Answer: $20
