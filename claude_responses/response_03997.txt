Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mitchell has 8 packets of gum.
2) Each packet contains 7 pieces of gum.
3) So the total number of pieces of gum Mitchell has is 8 packets * 7 pieces per packet = 56 pieces.
4) Mitchell chews all the gum except for 2 pieces.
5) So the number of pieces he chews at once is 56 - 2 = 54 pieces.

Answer: 54
