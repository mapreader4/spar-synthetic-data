Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barbara found 3 bundles of colored paper
* Each bundle holds 2 sheets of paper
* So the total number of colored paper sheets is 3 bundles x 2 sheets/bundle = 6 sheets

* Barbara also found 2 bunches of white paper
* Each bunch holds 4 sheets of paper
* So the total number of white paper sheets is 2 bunches x 4 sheets/bunch = 8 sheets

* Finally, Barbara found 5 heaps of scrap paper
* Each heap holds 20 sheets of paper
* So the total number of scrap paper sheets is 5 heaps x 20 sheets/heap = 100 sheets

Now, to find the total number of sheets of paper Barbara removed from the chest of drawers, we add up the colored, white, and scrap paper:
6 sheets + 8 sheets + 100 sheets = 114 sheets

Answer: 114
