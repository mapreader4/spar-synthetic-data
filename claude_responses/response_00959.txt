To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of snowballs and then calculate the percentage of snowballs that Janet made.

Given information:
- Janet made 50 snowballs.
- Janet's brother made 150 snowballs.

Step 1: Find the total number of snowballs.
Total number of snowballs = Janet's snowballs + Janet's brother's snowballs
Total number of snowballs = 50 + 150 = 200 snowballs

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of snowballs that Janet made.
Percentage of snowballs Janet made = (Janet's snowballs / Total number of snowballs) × 100
Percentage of snowballs Janet made = (50 / 200) × 100 = 25%

Answer: 25
