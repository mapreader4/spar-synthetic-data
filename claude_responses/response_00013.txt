Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10
* The cost of the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds, so the cost per pound of cheddar cheese is $10 / 2 = $5 per pound
* Jasper also buys a pound of cream cheese that costs half the price of the cheddar cheese
* The cost of the cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese, which is $5 / 2 = $2.50 per pound
* Jasper also buys a pack of cold cuts that costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese
* The cost of the pack of cold cuts is twice the price of the cheddar cheese, which is $5 * 2 = $10

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
* Cost of 2 pounds of cheddar cheese: $10
* Cost of 1 pound of cream cheese: $2.50
* Cost of 1 pack of cold cuts: $10
* Total cost = $10 + $2.50 + $10 = $22.50
