Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* One serving of soup has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth
* We need to find the total amount of vegetables and broth for 8 servings
* For the vegetables:
  - 1 cup of vegetables per serving
  - 8 servings
  - Total vegetables = 1 cup x 8 servings = 8 cups
* For the broth:
  - 2.5 cups of broth per serving
  - 8 servings
  - Total broth = 2.5 cups x 8 servings = 20 cups
* The total amount of vegetables and broth combined is 8 cups + 20 cups = 28 cups
* 1 pint = 2 cups
* 28 cups / 2 cups per pint = 14 pints
