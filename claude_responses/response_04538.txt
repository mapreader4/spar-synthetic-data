Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* There are 12 dogs on stage
* Half of the dogs (6 dogs) are standing on their back legs
* The other half (6 dogs) are standing on all 4 legs
* For the 6 dogs standing on their back legs, each dog has 2 paws on the ground
* For the 6 dogs standing on all 4 legs, each dog has 4 paws on the ground
* To calculate the total number of paws on the ground:
* 6 dogs with 2 paws each = 6 x 2 = 12 paws
* 6 dogs with 4 paws each = 6 x 4 = 24 paws
* Total paws on the ground = 12 + 24 = 36 paws

Answer: 36
