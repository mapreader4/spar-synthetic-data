Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jean has a total number of spots on her fur coat
* Half of the spots are located on her upper torso, which is 30 spots
* One-third of the spots are located on her back and hindquarters
* The remaining spots are located on her sides

To find the number of spots on her sides, we need to first find the total number of spots, and then subtract the spots on her upper torso and back/hindquarters.

Step 1: Find the total number of spots
* Half of the spots are on her upper torso, which is 30 spots
* This means the total number of spots is 2 x 30 = 60 spots

Step 2: Find the number of spots on her back and hindquarters
* One-third of the 60 total spots are on her back and hindquarters
* 1/3 of 60 = 20 spots

Step 3: Find the number of spots on her sides
* The remaining spots are on her sides
* Total spots (60) - spots on upper torso (30) - spots on back/hindquarters (20) = 10 spots

Answer: 10 spots
