Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Neil charges $5.00 to trim up each boxwood.
2) There are 30 boxwoods in the hedge.
3) So, the cost to trim up the entire hedge would be: 30 boxwoods x $5.00 per boxwood = $150.00.
4) Neil also charges $15.00 to trim a boxwood into a fancy shape.
5) The customer has requested 4 boxwoods to be shaped into spheres.
6) So, the cost for the 4 shaped boxwoods would be: 4 boxwoods x $15.00 per boxwood = $60.00.
7) The total charge for Neil's services would be the cost of trimming up the hedge ($150.00) plus the cost of shaping the 4 boxwoods ($60.00).
