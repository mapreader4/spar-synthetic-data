Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jolene babysits for 4 families, and she gets $30 for each family.
2) So for the babysitting, she earned: 4 families x $30 per family = $120
3) Jolene also washes 5 neighbors' cars, and she gets $12 for each car.
4) So for the car washing, she earned: 5 cars x $12 per car = $60
5) To calculate the total amount Jolene raised, we add the babysitting earnings and the car washing earnings:
$120 + $60 = $180

Answer: 180
