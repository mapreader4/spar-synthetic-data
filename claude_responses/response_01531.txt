Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The man spends 2 years getting in shape to start mountain climbing.
2) He then spends twice that long, which is 4 years, learning to be a technically proficient mountain climber.
3) He then climbs the 7 summits, spending 5 months on each one. 7 mountains x 5 months = 35 months.
4) After that, he spends 13 months learning to dive.
5) He then dives through all the caves he wants in 2 years.

Now, let's add up the total time:
2 years to get in shape
+ 4 years to learn mountain climbing
+ 35 months (2 years and 11 months) to climb the 7 summits
+ 13 months to learn to dive
+ 2 years to dive through the caves

Total time: 2 + 4 + 2.92 + 1.08 + 2 = 12 years

Answer: 12 years
