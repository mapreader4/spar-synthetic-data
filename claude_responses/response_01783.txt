Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) David has 15 shells.
2) Mia has 4 times as many shells as David, so Mia has 4 x 15 = 60 shells.
3) Ava has 20 more shells than Mia, so Ava has 60 + 20 = 80 shells.
4) Alice has half the number of shells Ava has, so Alice has 80 / 2 = 40 shells.
5) To find the total number of shells, we add up the shells of all 5 people:
   David: 15 shells
   Mia: 60 shells
   Ava: 80 shells
   Alice: 40 shells
   Total: 15 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 195 shells

Answer: 195
