Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jane bought 600 minnows
2) Each prize is a bowl with 3 minnows
3) 800 people are going to play the game
4) 15% of the 800 people will win a prize

First, we need to calculate how many people will win a prize:
* 15% of 800 people = 0.15 * 800 = 120 people

Now, we need to calculate how many minnows will be used for the prizes:
* Each prize has 3 minnows, and there are 120 prizes
* 120 prizes * 3 minnows per prize = 360 minnows

Finally, we can calculate the number of minnows left over:
* Jane bought 600 minnows
* 360 minnows were used for the prizes
* 600 minnows - 360 minnows = 240 minnows left over

Answer: 240
