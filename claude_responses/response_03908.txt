Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael takes a bath twice a week
* He takes a shower once a week
* There are 52 weeks in a year (about one year)

So, in 52 weeks:
* Baths per year: 2 baths per week x 52 weeks = 104 baths
* Showers per year: 1 shower per week x 52 weeks = 52 showers

Now, to get the total number of times Michael cleans himself in 52 weeks, we add the number of baths and showers:
* Total cleanings = 104 baths + 52 showers = 156 cleanings

Answer: 156
