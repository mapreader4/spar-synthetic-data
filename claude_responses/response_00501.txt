Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John trains 5 days a week
* He starts with wall push-ups and adds 1 rep per day
* Once he reaches 15 reps, he moves on to high elevation push-ups
* After high elevation push-ups, he moves on to low elevation push-ups
* Finally, he moves on to floor push-ups

To get to 15 reps of wall push-ups:
* He starts with 1 rep and adds 1 per day
* 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 reps
* This takes 5 days

After 15 reps of wall push-ups, he moves on to high elevation push-ups. Let's assume it takes him the same amount of time to work up to 15 reps of high elevation push-ups and low elevation push-ups.
* 5 days for each type of push-up
* 5 days for high elevation push-ups + 5 days for low elevation push-ups = 10 days

Finally, he moves on to floor push-ups. Let's assume it takes him the same amount of time to work up to 15 reps of floor push-ups as the other types.
* 5 more days

In total:
* 5 days for wall push-ups
* 10 days for high and low elevation push-ups
* 5 days for floor push-ups
* 5 + 10 + 5 = 20 days

Answer: 4 weeks
