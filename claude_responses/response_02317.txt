Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The mom ordered lobster for $25.50
* The dad ordered steak for $35.00
* The twin boys each ordered a cheeseburger and fries for $13.50 each, so that's $27.00 total
* They started with an appetizer that cost $8.50
* Everyone ordered a dessert that cost $6.00 each, so that's $24.00 total
* Adding up the food costs:
  - Lobster: $25.50
  - Steak: $35.00
  - Cheeseburgers: $27.00
  - Appetizer: $8.50
  - Desserts: $24.00
  - Total food cost: $120.00
* They wanted to give a 20% tip, so the tip amount would be 20% of $120.00, which is $24.00
* Therefore, the final bill total would be the total food cost plus the tip:
  - Total food cost: $120.00
  - Tip: $24.00
  - Final bill total: $120.00 + $24.00 = $144.00

Answer: $144
