Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian.
2) Ian has half as much money as Jessica has.
3) Jessica has 100 dollars.

First, let's find out how much money Ian has:
* Jessica has 100 dollars
* Ian has half as much as Jessica
* So, Ian has 100 / 2 = 50 dollars

Now, let's find out how much money Rodney has:
* Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian
* Ian has 50 dollars
* So, Rodney has 50 + 35 = 85 dollars

Finally, let's find out how much more money Jessica has than Rodney:
* Jessica has 100 dollars
* Rodney has 85 dollars
* So, Jessica has 100 - 85 = 15 dollars more than Rodney
