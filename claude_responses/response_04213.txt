Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Bobby has three squares of fabric that he will use to make a flag.
2) The first square is 8 feet by 5 feet.
3) The second square is 10 feet by 7 feet.
4) The third square is 5 feet by 5 feet.
5) Bobby wants the flag to be 15 feet long.
6) To find the height of the flag, we need to add up the heights of the three squares.
7) The height of the first square is 5 feet.
8) The height of the second square is 7 feet.
9) The height of the third square is 5 feet.
10) Adding these together, we get 5 + 7 + 5 = 17 feet.

Answer: 17 feet.
