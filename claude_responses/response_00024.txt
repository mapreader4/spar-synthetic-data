Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary has a credit limit of $100 for her grocery shopping.
2) That week, she spent the full credit limit of $100.
3) On Tuesday, she paid $15 towards her credit.
4) On Thursday, she paid $23 towards her credit.
5) To calculate how much credit she has left to pay, we need to subtract the amounts she has already paid from the total credit limit.
6) Total credit limit: $100
7) Amount paid on Tuesday: $15
8) Amount paid on Thursday: $23
9) Total amount paid: $15 + $23 = $38
10) Amount remaining to pay: $100 - $38 = $62

Answer: 62
