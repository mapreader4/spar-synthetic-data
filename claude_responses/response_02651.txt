Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Felix needs to get his axe resharpened for every 13 trees he chops down.
2) We also know that he spends $35 on axe sharpening.
3) To find the minimum number of trees he has chopped down, we need to find the minimum number of times he has had to sharpen his axe.
4) To do this, we can divide the total cost of sharpening ($35) by the cost of each sharpening ($5).
5) $35 / $5 = 7 times.
6) Since he needs to sharpen his axe for every 13 trees he chops down, the minimum number of trees he has chopped down is 7 * 13 = 91 trees.

Answer: 91
