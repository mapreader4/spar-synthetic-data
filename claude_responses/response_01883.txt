Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jim spends 8 hours scuba diving.
2) He finds a treasure chest with 100 gold coins in it.
3) He also finds 2 smaller bags that have half as much gold each.
4) To find the total amount of gold he finds, we need to add up the gold in the treasure chest and the 2 smaller bags.
5) The treasure chest has 100 gold coins.
6) Each of the 2 smaller bags has half as much gold as the treasure chest, which means each bag has 50 gold coins.
7) So the total amount of gold he finds is 100 + 50 + 50 = 200 gold coins.
8) To find the amount of gold he finds per hour, we divide the total amount of gold (200) by the number of hours he spent diving (8).

Answer: 25 gold coins per hour.
