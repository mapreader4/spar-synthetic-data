Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Karen's tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase.
2) When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen's tote.
3) Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase.
4) Karen's tote weighs 8 pounds.

First, let's find the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase:
* Karen's tote is twice the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase
* So, weight of Kevin's empty briefcase = 8 / 2 = 4 pounds

Next, let's find the weight of Kevin's full briefcase:
* Kevin's full briefcase is twice the weight of Karen's tote
* So, weight of Kevin's full briefcase = 8 * 2 = 16 pounds

Now, let's find the weight of Kevin's work papers:
* Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of his full briefcase
* So, weight of Kevin's work papers = 16 / 6 = 2.67 pounds

Finally, let's find the weight of Kevin's laptop:
* Weight of Kevin's full briefcase = 16 pounds
* Weight of Kevin's work papers = 2.67 pounds
* Weight of Kevin's laptop = 16 - 2.67 = 13.33 pounds

Therefore, Kevin's laptop weighs 13.33 - 8 = 5.33 more pounds than Karen's tote.
