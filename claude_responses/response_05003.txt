Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sandra eats 3 beignets every morning
* There are 7 days in a week
* So in one week, Sandra eats 3 beignets x 7 days = 21 beignets
* There are 16 weeks in the given time period
* To find the total number of beignets Sandra will eat in 16 weeks, we multiply the number of beignets per week (21) by the number of weeks (16)
* 21 beignets per week x 16 weeks = 336 beignets

Answer: 336
