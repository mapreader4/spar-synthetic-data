Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Apples:
   - The vendor bought apples at 2 for $3, which means each apple costs $1.50.
   - The vendor plans to sell the apples at 5 for $10, which means each apple will be sold for $2.
   - If the vendor sells 5 apples, he will make:
     - 5 apples x $2 per apple = $10 in revenue
     - 5 apples x $1.50 per apple = $7.50 in cost
     - Profit on apples = $10 - $7.50 = $2.50

2. Oranges:
   - The vendor bought 3 oranges for $2.70, which means each orange costs $0.90.
   - The vendor plans to sell the oranges at $1 each.
   - If the vendor sells 5 oranges, he will make:
     - 5 oranges x $1 per orange = $5 in revenue
     - 5 oranges x $0.90 per orange = $4.50 in cost
     - Profit on oranges = $5 - $4.50 = $0.50

3. Total Profit:
   - Profit on apples = $2.50
   - Profit on oranges = $0.50
   - Total Profit = $2.50 + $0.50 = $3.00

Answer: 3
