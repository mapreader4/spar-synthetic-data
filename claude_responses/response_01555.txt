Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Miss Walter has 50 gold stickers.
2) She has twice as many silver stickers as gold stickers. So, the number of silver stickers is 2 x 50 = 100.
3) She has 20 fewer bronze stickers than silver stickers. So, the number of bronze stickers is 100 - 20 = 80.
4) The total number of stickers is the sum of the gold, silver, and bronze stickers: 50 + 100 + 80 = 230.
5) Miss Walter wants to give the same number of stickers to each of her 5 students.
6) To find the number of stickers each student will receive, we divide the total number of stickers by the number of students: 230 / 5 = 46.

Answer: 46
