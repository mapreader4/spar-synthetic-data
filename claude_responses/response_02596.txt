Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Henry's scores on the 3 tests are:
- Geography: 50 points
- Math: 70 points
- English: 66 points
2) The average of these 3 scores is his History score.
3) To find the average, we add the 3 scores and divide by 3:
- (50 + 70 + 66) / 3 = 186 / 3 = 62
4) So his History score is 62 points.
5) To find his total score across all 4 subjects, we add up the 4 scores:
- 50 + 70 + 66 + 62 = 248

Answer: 248
