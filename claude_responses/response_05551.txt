Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Delores starts with $450.
2) She buys a computer for $400.
3) She buys a printer for $40.
4) To calculate how much money Delores has left, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer and printer from her initial $450.
5) The total cost of the computer and printer is $400 + $40 = $440.
6) Subtracting $440 from $450 gives us the amount of money Delores has left.
