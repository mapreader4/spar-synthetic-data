Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each regular dinosaur weighs 800 pounds.
2) There are 5 regular dinosaurs.
3) The combined weight of the 5 regular dinosaurs is:
   5 x 800 pounds = 4,000 pounds
4) Barney the dinosaur weighs 1,500 pounds more than the 5 regular dinosaurs combined.
5) So, Barney's weight is:
   4,000 pounds + 1,500 pounds = 5,500 pounds
6) The combined weight of Barney and the 5 regular dinosaurs is:
   5,500 pounds + 4,000 pounds = 9,500 pounds

Answer: 9,500 pounds
