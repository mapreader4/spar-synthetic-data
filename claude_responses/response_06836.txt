Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Darius scored 10 points
* Marius scored 3 points more than Darius
* So Marius scored 10 + 3 = 13 points
* Darius scored 5 points less than Matt
* So Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points

Now, we can add up the points scored by all three friends:
* Darius: 10 points
* Marius: 13 points
* Matt: 15 points
* Total points scored: 10 + 13 + 15 = 38 points

Answer: 38
