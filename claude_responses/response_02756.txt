Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In 2018, Super Soup had 23 stores.
* In 2019, they opened 5 new stores, but closed 2 stores that performed the worst.
* So in 2019, the total number of stores would be:
    * 23 (from 2018) + 5 (new stores opened) - 2 (stores closed) = 26 stores
* In 2020, they opened 10 new stores, but closed 6 stores that performed the worst.
* So in 2020, the total number of stores would be:
    * 26 (from 2019) + 10 (new stores opened) - 6 (stores closed) = 30 stores

Answer: 30 stores
