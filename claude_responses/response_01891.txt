Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Xia had 100 stickers that she shared with her friends.
2) After sharing the stickers, Xia had 5 sheets of stickers left.
3) Each sheet had 10 stickers on it.
4) To find the total number of stickers Xia had at the beginning, we need to add the 100 stickers she shared with her friends to the 50 stickers (5 sheets x 10 stickers per sheet) she had left.
5) 100 stickers shared + 50 stickers left = 150 stickers total.

Answer: 150
