Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Blaine caught 5 fish
* Keith caught twice as many fish as Blaine
* To find how many fish Keith caught, we multiply Blaine's catch by 2:
  * Keith's catch = 2 x 5 = 10 fish
* To find the total number of fish they caught together, we add Blaine's catch and Keith's catch:
  * Total fish caught = Blaine's catch + Keith's catch
  * Total fish caught = 5 + 10 = 15 fish

Answer: 15
