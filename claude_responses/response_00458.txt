Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joey got 8 votes.
2) Barry got twice as many votes as 3 more than the number of votes Joey got.
   * Joey got 8 votes, so 3 more than that is 11 votes.
   * Barry got twice as many votes as 11, which is 22 votes.
3) Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry.
   * Barry got 22 votes, so Marcy got 3 times that, which is 66 votes.

Answer: 66
