Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Before breaking his arm, Cameron could type 10 words per minute
* After breaking his arm, Cameron could type 8 words per minute
* We want to find the difference in the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after breaking his arm

To find the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before breaking his arm:
* 10 words per minute x 5 minutes = 50 words

To find the number of words he could type in 5 minutes after breaking his arm:
* 8 words per minute x 5 minutes = 40 words

To find the difference:
* 50 words - 40 words = 10 words

Answer: 10
