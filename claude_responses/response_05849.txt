Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, which is a duration of 30 minutes.
* The show airs only on weekdays, which means it airs on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
* Max watches every episode during the week, except for the Friday episode.
* So, Max watched the show for 4 days (Monday through Thursday).
* Each day, he watched the show for 30 minutes.
* Therefore, the total time Max watched the show is:
4 days x 30 minutes per day = 120 minutes
* Converting this to hours:
120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
