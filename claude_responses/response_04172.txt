Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 9 adults attending the play
* Each adult ticket costs $11
* So the total cost of the adult tickets is:
    - 9 adults x $11 per ticket = $99
* There are 7 children attending the play
* Each child ticket costs $7
* So the total cost of the children's tickets is:
    - 7 children x $7 per ticket = $49
* To find the difference in cost between the adult tickets and the children's tickets, we subtract the total cost of the children's tickets from the total cost of the adult tickets:
    - $99 (adult tickets) - $49 (children's tickets) = $50

Answer: $50
