Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Richmond has 1000 more people than Victoria.
2) Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon.
3) Richmond has 3000 people.

Since Richmond has 1000 more people than Victoria, we can say that Victoria has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 people.

Since Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon, we can say that Beacon has 2000 / 4 = 500 people.

Answer: 500
