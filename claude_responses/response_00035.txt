Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that 40% of Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 students got a final grade below B.
2) This means that 60% of his Grade 5 students got a final grade of B and above.
3) We also know that Mr. Sanchez has 60 students in Grade 5.
4) To calculate the number of students who got a final grade of B and above, we take 60% of 60 students:
60% of 60 = 0.60 * 60 = 36 students.

Answer: 36 students.
