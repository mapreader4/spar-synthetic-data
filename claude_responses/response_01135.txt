Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Reggie's father gave him $48.
2) Reggie bought 5 books, each costing $2.
3) To calculate the total cost of the books, we multiply the number of books (5) by the cost of each book ($2):
5 books x $2 per book = $10 total cost of books.
4) To calculate the amount of money Reggie has left, we take the amount his father gave him ($48) and subtract the total cost of the books ($10):
$48 - $10 = $38.
Answer: 38
