Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Ines had $20 in her purse initially.
2) She bought 3 pounds of peaches at $2 per pound.
3) To calculate the total cost of the peaches, we multiply the number of pounds (3) by the price per pound ($2):
3 pounds x $2 per pound = $6
4) To calculate how much Ines had left, we subtract the cost of the peaches ($6) from the initial amount she had ($20):
$20 - $6 = $14
Answer: 14
