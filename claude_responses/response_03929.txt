Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alvin ate 4 egg rolls
* Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin
* So, if Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, Patrick ate 2 egg rolls (half of 4)
* Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick
* Since Patrick ate 2 egg rolls, Matthew ate 6 egg rolls (3 times 2)
