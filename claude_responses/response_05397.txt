Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Grant sold his baseball cards for $25.
2. He sold his baseball bat for $10.
3. He sold his baseball glove at 20% off. The original price of the glove was $30. 20% off of $30 is $6, so he sold the glove for $24.
4. He sold both pairs of his baseball cleats for $10 each, so that's $20 total.

Now, let's add up all the money he made:
$25 (baseball cards) + $10 (baseball bat) + $24 (baseball glove) + $20 (baseball cleats) = $79

Answer: $79
