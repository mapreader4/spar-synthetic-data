Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bailey bought 8 dog treats
* She also bought 2 chew toys
* She also bought 10 rawhide bones
* So the total number of items she bought is:
    - 8 dog treats + 2 chew toys + 10 rawhide bones = 20 items
* She had to split the charges equally across 4 credit cards
* To find the number of items in each charge, we divide the total number of items by 4:
    - 20 items / 4 credit cards = 5 items per charge
