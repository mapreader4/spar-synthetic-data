Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aren's flight from New York to Hawaii will take 11 hours and 20 minutes
* He spends:
    - 2 hours reading
    - 4 hours watching two movies
    - 30 minutes eating his dinner
    - 40 minutes listening to the radio
    - 1 hour and 10 minutes playing games
* To calculate the total time spent on these activities:
    - 2 hours + 4 hours + 0.5 hours + 0.67 hours + 1.17 hours = 8.33 hours
* Now, we need to subtract the total time spent on these activities from the total flight time:
    - 11 hours and 20 minutes = 11.33 hours
    - 11.33 hours - 8.33 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Aren has 3 hours left to take a nap.
