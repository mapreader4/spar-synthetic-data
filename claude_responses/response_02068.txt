Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janessa initially had 4 cards
* Her father gave her 13 cards
* So, she started with a total of 4 + 13 = 17 cards
* She then ordered a collection of 36 cards from eBay
* After inspecting the cards, she found 4 were in bad shape and threw them away
* So, the total number of cards she had after the eBay order was 17 + 36 - 4 = 49 cards
* She then gave Dexter 29 cards
* So, the number of cards Janessa kept for herself is 49 - 29 = 20 cards

Answer: 20
