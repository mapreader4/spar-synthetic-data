Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hayes does 3 loads of laundry per week
* He uses 1 detergent pod per load
* So, he uses 3 detergent pods per week
* There are 39 detergent pods in each pack
* To calculate the number of packs needed for a full year (52 weeks):
* 3 pods per week x 52 weeks = 156 pods needed per year
* 156 pods needed / 39 pods per pack = 4 packs needed

Answer: 4 packs
