Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The clown has 3 dozen balloons on a string in his hand.
* 1 dozen = 12 balloons
* 3 dozen = 3 x 12 = 36 balloons

Now, the clown sells:
* 3 balloons to the 3 boys
* 12 balloons to the 12 girls
* Total balloons sold = 3 + 12 = 15 balloons

The clown is still holding:
* 36 balloons (the original amount) - 15 balloons (sold) = 21 balloons

Answer: 21
