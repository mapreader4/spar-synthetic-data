Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vivi bought checkered fabric and plain fabric
* The checkered fabric cost $75
* The plain fabric cost $45
* Both fabrics cost $7.50 per yard

To find the total yards of fabric Vivi bought, we need to calculate the number of yards for each type of fabric and then add them together.

For the checkered fabric:
* Cost of checkered fabric = $75
* Cost per yard = $7.50
* Number of yards of checkered fabric = $75 / $7.50 = 10 yards

For the plain fabric:
* Cost of plain fabric = $45
* Cost per yard = $7.50
* Number of yards of plain fabric = $45 / $7.50 = 6 yards

Total yards of fabric bought:
* 10 yards of checkered fabric + 6 yards of plain fabric = 16 yards

Answer: 16
