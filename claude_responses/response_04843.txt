Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Josh has soccer practice on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
* Each soccer practice session lasts 2 hours (from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.)
* Josh has 3 soccer practice sessions per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday)
* So the total time spent on soccer practice per week is 3 sessions x 2 hours per session = 6 hours

* Josh has band practice on Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
* Each band practice session lasts 1.5 hours (from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.)
* Josh has 2 band practice sessions per week (Tuesday and Thursday)
* So the total time spent on band practice per week is 2 sessions x 1.5 hours per session = 3 hours

* To calculate the total time spent on extracurricular activities per week, we add the time spent on soccer practice and band practice:
* Total time = 6 hours (soccer) + 3 hours (band) = 9 hours

Answer: 9 hours
