Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The distance from where Carol is to her college is 220 miles.
2) Carol's car gets 20 miles per gallon.
3) Carol's car has a 16-gallon gas tank.
4) To calculate how many miles Carol can drive on a full tank, we multiply the tank size (16 gallons) by the miles per gallon (20 miles/gallon): 16 gallons * 20 miles/gallon = 320 miles.
5) Since Carol has driven 220 miles to get to her college, she has 320 miles - 220 miles = 100 miles left in her tank.

Answer: 100 miles
