Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cecil has $600.
2. Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil.
   * Twice Cecil's money is 2 x $600 = $1,200.
   * $1,200 - $250 = $950, so Catherine has $950.
3. Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money.
   * Twice Cecil's money is 2 x $600 = $1,200.
   * $1,200 + $50 = $1,250, so Carmela has $1,250.

Now, to find the total amount of money they have altogether, we add up the amounts:
Cecil: $600
Catherine: $950
Carmela: $1,250

Total: $600 + $950 + $1,250 = $2,800

Answer: $2,800
