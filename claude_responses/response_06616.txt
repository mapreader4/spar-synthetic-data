Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are two sections in Grade 4: Diligence and Industry
* The two sections have an equal number of students after 2 students were transferred from section Industry to Diligence
* The total number of students in both sections combined is 50

Let's call the number of students in each section before the transfer as x.

* Before the transfer, Diligence had x students and Industry had x students
* After the transfer, Diligence had x + 2 students and Industry had x - 2 students
* The total number of students in both sections is still 50, so:
    (x + 2) + (x - 2) = 50
    2x = 50
    x = 25

Therefore, the number of students in section Diligence before the transfer was:
Answer: 25
