Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Brittany got a 78 on her first test
* After her second test, her average rose to an 81
* Let's call the grade on her second test 'x'
* The average of the two tests is (78 + x) / 2 = 81
* Solving this equation:
* 78 + x = 162
* x = 162 - 78
* x = 84
Answer: 84
