Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carla originally had 400 chickens on her farm.
2) 40% of the chickens died due to a disease.
3) To find the number of chickens that died, we take 40% of the original 400 chickens:
   * 40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160 chickens died
4) Carla then bought ten times as many chickens as the number that died due to the disease.
   * 10 * 160 = 1,600 chickens bought
5) To find the total number of chickens on the farm after the disease and the new chickens bought, we take the original 400 chickens, subtract the 160 that died, and add the 1,600 new chickens:
   * 400 - 160 + 1,600 = 1,840 chickens

Answer: 1,840
