Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carson counted 6 clouds that look like funny animals
* Carson's little brother counted 3 times as many clouds that look like dragons
* To find the number of clouds the little brother counted, we multiply Carson's count by 3:
  * 6 clouds x 3 = 18 clouds
* To find the total number of clouds they counted, we add Carson's count and the little brother's count:
  * 6 clouds + 18 clouds = 24 clouds

Answer: 24
