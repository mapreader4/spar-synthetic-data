Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The video game costs $60.
2) The assortment of candy costs $5.
3) Chris agreed to babysit his little sister for $8 per hour.
4) He worked for 9 hours.
5) To calculate the total amount of money he earned, we multiply the hourly rate ($8) by the number of hours worked (9):
$8 x 9 = $72
6) To calculate the total cost of his purchases, we add the cost of the video game ($60) and the cost of the candy ($5):
$60 + $5 = $65
7) To calculate the amount of money left over, we subtract the total cost of his purchases ($65) from the total amount of money he earned ($72):
$72 - $65 = $7
