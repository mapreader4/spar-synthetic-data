Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Let's call the number of students in Elementary School 'x'
* The number of students in Middle School is 50
* The number of students in Elementary School is three less than four times the number of students in Middle School
* So, we can write this as: x = 4 * 50 - 3
* Solving for x, we get: x = 200 - 3 = 197
* Now, to find the total number of students in both levels, we add the number of students in Elementary School and Middle School:
* Total students = 197 + 50 = 247

Answer: 247
