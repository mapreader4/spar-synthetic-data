Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The chocolate factory produces 50 candies per hour
* The factory has to fulfill an order of 4000 candies
* The factory works for 10 hours every day

To calculate how many days it will take to complete the order, we need to find out how many hours it will take to produce 4000 candies.

* The factory produces 50 candies per hour
* So in 1 hour, the factory can produce 50 candies
* To produce 4000 candies, the factory will need to work for 4000 / 50 = 80 hours

Now, we know the factory works for 10 hours every day, so we can calculate the number of days it will take:
* 80 hours / 10 hours per day = 8 days

Answer: 8 days
