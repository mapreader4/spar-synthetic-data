Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Oshea has 200 basil seeds to plant.
2) He has 4 large planters that can hold 20 seeds each.
3) So the large planters can hold a total of 4 * 20 = 80 seeds.
4) That leaves 200 - 80 = 120 seeds that need to be planted in the small planters.
5) Each small planter can hold 4 seeds.
6) To calculate how many small planters are needed, we divide the remaining 120 seeds by 4 seeds per planter.
7) 120 / 4 = 30 small planters.

Answer: 30
