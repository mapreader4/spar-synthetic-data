Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 main characters and 4 minor characters
* James pays the minor characters $15,000 each episode
* James pays the major characters three times as much as the minor characters

To calculate the total amount James pays per episode:
* Minor characters: 4 characters x $15,000 = $60,000
* Major characters: 5 characters x (3 x $15,000) = $225,000
* Total amount paid per episode: $60,000 + $225,000 = $285,000

Answer: $285,000
