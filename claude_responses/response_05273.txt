Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sarah needs to make 2 copies of the contract for each of the 9 people in the meeting.
2) The contract is 20 pages long.
3) To calculate the total number of pages Sarah will copy, we need to multiply the number of copies (2) by the number of people (9), and then multiply that by the number of pages in the contract (20).
4) 2 copies x 9 people = 18 copies
5) 18 copies x 20 pages per contract = 360 pages

Answer: 360
