Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lolita has 54,000 strawberry seeds.
2) In each planting zone, 3,123 seeds will be used.
3) She will accumulate 7 planting zones.
4) To calculate the total number of seeds used, we multiply the number of seeds used per zone (3,123) by the number of zones (7):
3,123 x 7 = 21,861 seeds used
5) To calculate the number of seeds remaining, we subtract the total seeds used from the initial number of seeds:
54,000 - 21,861 = 32,139 seeds remaining

Answer: 32,139
