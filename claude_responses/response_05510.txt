Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Karl has 25 stickers.
2) Ryan has 20 more stickers than Karl, so Ryan has 25 + 20 = 45 stickers.
3) Ben has 10 fewer stickers than Ryan, so Ben has 45 - 10 = 35 stickers.
4) To find the total number of stickers they placed in the sticker book, we add up the stickers of all three:
   Karl's stickers: 25
   Ryan's stickers: 45
   Ben's stickers: 35
   Total stickers: 25 + 45 + 35 = 105

Answer: 105
