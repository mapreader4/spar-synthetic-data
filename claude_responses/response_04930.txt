Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first 2 days, James cuts down 20 trees each day.
   * So, in the first 2 days, James cuts down 20 + 20 = 40 trees.

2. For the next 3 days, James and his 2 brothers work together.
   * They cut 20% fewer trees per day than James alone.
   * So, if James cuts down 20 trees per day, his brothers will cut down 20 * (1 - 0.2) = 16 trees per day.
   * Together, they cut down 20 + 16 + 16 = 52 trees per day.
   * Over the 3 days, they cut down 52 * 3 = 156 trees.

3. To find the total number of trees cut down, we add the trees cut down in the first 2 days and the trees cut down in the next 3 days:
   * 40 + 156 = 196 trees

Answer: 196
