Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jesus has 60 squares
* Linden has 75 squares
* Pedro has 200 squares
* To find how many more squares Pedro has than both Jesus and Linden combined, we need to:
1. Add up the squares that Jesus and Linden have:
   * Jesus has 60 squares
   * Linden has 75 squares
   * 60 + 75 = 135 squares
2. Subtract the total squares that Jesus and Linden have from the squares that Pedro has:
   * Pedro has 200 squares
   * 200 - 135 = 65 squares

Answer: 65
