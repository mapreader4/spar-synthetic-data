Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps
* On Monday, she was only able to do 12 situps
* So, she still needed to do 30 - 12 = 18 situps to meet her goal
* On Tuesday, she was only able to do 19 situps
* So, she still needed to do 30 - 19 = 11 situps to meet her goal
* In total, she was unable to do 18 + 11 = 29 situps to meet her goal
* Therefore, Shawna would need to do 29 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do on Monday and Tuesday.

Answer: 29
