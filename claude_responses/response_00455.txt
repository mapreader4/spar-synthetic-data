To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the amoeba needs to divide to reach 16 amoebae.

Given information:
- An amoeba reproduces by splitting itself into two separate amoebae.
- An amoeba reproduces every two days.

Let's start with one amoeba and track the number of amoebae over time:
- Day 0: 1 amoeba
- Day 2: 1 amoeba splits into 2 amoebae
- Day 4: 2 amoebae split into 4 amoebae
- Day 6: 4 amoebae split into 8 amoebae
- Day 8: 8 amoebae split into 16 amoebae

We can see that it takes 8 days for the amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

Answer: 8 days
