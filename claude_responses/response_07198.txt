Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Betty had 60 marbles in her collection.
2) She gave 40% of her marbles to Stuart.
3) 40% of 60 is 0.4 * 60 = 24 marbles.
4) So Betty gave Stuart 24 marbles.
5) After the transfer, Stuart had 80 marbles.
6) To find how many marbles Stuart had initially, we need to subtract the 24 marbles he received from Betty from the 80 marbles he has now.
7) 80 - 24 = 56 marbles.

Answer: 56
