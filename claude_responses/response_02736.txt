Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Paul lives in a 5th story apartment
* Each story is 10 feet tall
* He makes 3 trips out from and back to his apartment each day
* This is done for 7 days in a week

To calculate the total vertical distance traveled, we need to:
1. Calculate the vertical distance traveled per trip
2. Multiply that by the number of trips per day
3. Multiply that by the number of days in a week

Vertical distance traveled per trip:
* Paul's apartment is on the 5th floor
* Each floor is 10 feet tall
* So the vertical distance traveled per trip is 5 floors x 10 feet/floor = 50 feet

Vertical distance traveled per day:
* 3 trips per day
* 50 feet per trip
* 3 trips x 50 feet/trip = 150 feet per day

Vertical distance traveled per week:
* 7 days in a week
* 150 feet per day
* 7 days x 150 feet/day = 1,050 feet

Answer: 1,050 feet
