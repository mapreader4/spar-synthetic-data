Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lisa makes breakfast for her family every weekday (Monday through Friday)
* She makes 2 eggs for each of her 4 children
* That's 2 eggs x 4 children = 8 eggs for the children
* She makes 3 eggs for her husband
* She makes 2 eggs for herself
* So the total number of eggs she makes for each day is:
  - 8 eggs for the children
  - 3 eggs for her husband
  - 2 eggs for herself
  - Total: 8 + 3 + 2 = 13 eggs per day
* There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday through Friday)
* So in a week, she makes 13 eggs x 5 days = 65 eggs
* There are 52 weeks in a year
* So in a year, she makes 65 eggs x 52 weeks = 3,380 eggs

Answer: 3,380
