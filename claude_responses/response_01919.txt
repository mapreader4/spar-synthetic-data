Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Roger bought a house for $100,000.
2) He was able to pay 20% down.
   - 20% of $100,000 is $20,000.
   - So, the initial down payment was $20,000.
3) The remaining balance after the down payment is $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000.
4) Roger's parents paid off an additional 30% of the remaining balance.
   - 30% of $80,000 is $24,000.
   - So, the amount paid off by Roger's parents is $24,000.
5) The remaining balance that Roger still owes on the house is $80,000 - $24,000 = $56,000.

Answer: $56,000
