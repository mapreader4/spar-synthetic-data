Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rohan's coconut farm is 20 square meters in size.
2) Each square meter has 2 coconut trees.
3) Each coconut tree has 6 coconuts.
4) The coconuts can be harvested every 3 months.
5) Each coconut costs $0.50.
6) We need to find Rohan's earnings after 6 months.

First, let's calculate the total number of coconuts Rohan can harvest in 6 months:
* Each square meter has 2 trees, and each tree has 6 coconuts.
* So, each square meter has 2 * 6 = 12 coconuts.
* Since the farm is 20 square meters, the total number of coconuts is 20 * 12 = 240 coconuts.
* In 6 months, Rohan can harvest the coconuts twice (every 3 months).
* So, the total number of coconuts harvested in 6 months is 240 * 2 = 480 coconuts.

Now, let's calculate Rohan's earnings:
* Each coconut costs $0.50.
* So, the total earnings from 480 coconuts is 480 * $0.50 = $240.

Answer: $240
