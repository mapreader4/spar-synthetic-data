Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We have 109 fifth graders, 115 sixth graders, and 118 seventh graders.
2) There are 4 teachers and 2 parents from each grade coming along to chaperone.
3) So the total number of people going on the field trip is:
   - 109 fifth graders + 115 sixth graders + 118 seventh graders
   - + 4 fifth grade teachers + 2 fifth grade parents
   - + 4 sixth grade teachers + 2 sixth grade parents
   - + 4 seventh grade teachers + 2 seventh grade parents
   - = 109 + 115 + 118 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2
   - = 360 people
4) Each bus has 72 seats.
5) To calculate the number of buses needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of seats per bus:
   - 360 people / 72 seats per bus = 5 buses

Answer: 5 buses
