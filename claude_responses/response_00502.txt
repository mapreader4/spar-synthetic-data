Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tish bought 4 items: a red horseshoe magnet, two stuffed animals, and a large sticker
* The magnet cost three times more than the sticker
* The magnet cost one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined
* The magnet cost $3

First, let's find the cost of the sticker:
* The magnet cost three times more than the sticker
* So the sticker cost $3 / 3 = $1

Now, let's find the cost of the two stuffed animals combined:
* The magnet cost one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined
* So the two stuffed animals combined cost $3 x 4 = $12

Finally, to find the cost of a single stuffed animal:
* The two stuffed animals combined cost $12
* So a single stuffed animal cost $12 / 2 = $6

Answer: $6
