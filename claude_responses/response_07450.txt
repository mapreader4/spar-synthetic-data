Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 96 campers at Camp Wonka.
2) Two-thirds of the campers are boys, and one-third are girls.
   * To calculate the number of boys, we take two-thirds of 96: 2/3 * 96 = 64 boys.
   * To calculate the number of girls, we take one-third of 96: 1/3 * 96 = 32 girls.
3) 50% of the boys want to toast marshmallows.
   * 50% of 64 boys = 0.5 * 64 = 32 boys want to toast marshmallows.
4) 75% of the girls want to toast marshmallows.
   * 75% of 32 girls = 0.75 * 32 = 24 girls want to toast marshmallows.
5) To find the total number of marshmallows needed, we add the number of boys and girls who want to toast marshmallows:
   * 32 boys + 24 girls = 56 marshmallows.

Answer: 56
