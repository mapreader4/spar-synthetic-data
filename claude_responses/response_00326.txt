Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Fred had 236 dollars to spend on 6 books
* After buying the books, he had 14 dollars left
* To find the average cost of each book, we need to:
  1. Calculate the total amount Fred spent on the 6 books
  2. Divide the total amount spent by the number of books (6)

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Fred spent on the 6 books
* Fred had 236 dollars to start with
* He had 14 dollars left after buying the books
* So, the total amount he spent on the 6 books is:
  * 236 dollars - 14 dollars = 222 dollars

Step 2: Divide the total amount spent by the number of books (6)
* Total amount spent: 222 dollars
* Number of books: 6
* Average cost per book = 222 dollars / 6 = 37 dollars

Answer: 37
