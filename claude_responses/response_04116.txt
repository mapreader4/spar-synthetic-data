Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pierre gets 3 scoops of ice cream
* Each scoop costs $2
* So the cost of Pierre's ice cream is:
  * 3 scoops x $2 per scoop = $6
* Pierre's mom gets 4 scoops of ice cream
* Each scoop costs $2
* So the cost of the mom's ice cream is:
  * 4 scoops x $2 per scoop = $8
* To calculate the total bill, we add the cost of Pierre's ice cream and his mom's ice cream:
  * $6 + $8 = $14
