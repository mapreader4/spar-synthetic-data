Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gina's snake eats one mouse every 4 weeks
* We want to know how many mice it will eat in a decade
* A decade is 10 years
* There are 52 weeks in a year
* So in 1 year, the snake will eat 52 / 4 = 13 mice
* In 10 years (a decade), the snake will eat 13 mice x 10 years = 130 mice

Answer: 130
