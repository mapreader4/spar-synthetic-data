To solve this problem, we need to find the boy's speed in kilometers per hour.

Given information:
- The boy runs 1.5 km in 45 minutes.

Step 1: Convert the time from minutes to hours.
45 minutes = 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours

Step 2: Calculate the boy's speed in kilometers per hour.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1.5 km / 0.75 hours
Speed = 2 km/h

Answer: 2 km/h
