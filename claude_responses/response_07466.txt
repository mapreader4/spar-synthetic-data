Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Clarinet lessons:
   * Janet pays $40 per hour
   * She has 3 hours of clarinet lessons per week
   * So, the weekly cost of clarinet lessons is:
     * $40 per hour x 3 hours per week = $120 per week

2. Piano lessons:
   * Janet pays $28 per hour
   * She has 5 hours of piano lessons per week
   * So, the weekly cost of piano lessons is:
     * $28 per hour x 5 hours per week = $140 per week

3. Calculating the yearly cost:
   * There are 52 weeks in a year
   * Clarinet lessons yearly cost:
     * $120 per week x 52 weeks = $6,240 per year
   * Piano lessons yearly cost:
     * $140 per week x 52 weeks = $7,280 per year

4. Calculating the difference:
   * Piano lessons yearly cost: $7,280
   * Clarinet lessons yearly cost: $6,240
   * Difference: $7,280 - $6,240 = $1,040

Answer: $1,040
