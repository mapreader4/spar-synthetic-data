Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There will be 30 kids playing soccer, including Katie.
2) Katie's mother wants to get 2 granola bars for each kid.
3) So the total number of granola bars needed is 30 kids * 2 bars per kid = 60 granola bars.
4) Each box of granola bars has 12 bars in it.
5) To calculate the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of granola bars needed (60) by the number of bars per box (12).
6) 60 granola bars / 12 bars per box = 5 boxes.

Answer: 5 boxes.
