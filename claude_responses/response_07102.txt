Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bob's property is 1000 feet wide and 2250 feet long.
2) He wants the width of the garden to be about an eighth of the width of his property. 
   * 1000 feet / 8 = 125 feet
3) He wants the length of the garden to be a tenth of the length of his property.
   * 2250 feet / 10 = 225 feet
4) To calculate the area of the garden, we multiply the width and length:
   * 125 feet x 225 feet = 28,125 square feet

Answer: 28,125 square feet
