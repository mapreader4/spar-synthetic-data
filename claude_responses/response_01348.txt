Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) A single kabob stick has 4 cubes of beef.
2) A slab of beef that costs $25 can be cut into 80 cubes.
3) We need to find how much Simon must spend to make 40 kabob sticks.
4) First, we need to find how many cubes of beef are needed for 40 kabob sticks. Since each kabob stick has 4 cubes, we need 40 * 4 = 160 cubes of beef.
5) Next, we need to find how many slabs of beef are needed to get 160 cubes. Since each slab has 80 cubes, we need 160 / 80 = 2 slabs of beef.
6) Finally, since each slab of beef costs $25, Simon must spend 2 * $25 = $50 to make 40 kabob sticks.

Answer: 50
