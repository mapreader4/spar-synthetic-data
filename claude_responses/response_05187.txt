Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 test tubes
* Each test tube contains 7 mL of solution
* So the total amount of solution in the 6 test tubes is:
    * 6 test tubes x 7 mL per test tube = 42 mL
* Dr. Igor then takes all 42 mL of solution and evenly distributes it into 3 beakers
* To find the amount of solution in each beaker, we divide the total amount of solution (42 mL) by the number of beakers (3)
* 42 mL รท 3 beakers = 14 mL per beaker

Answer: 14 mL
