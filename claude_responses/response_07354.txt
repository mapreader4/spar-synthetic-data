Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Helen cuts her lawn from March through October, which is 8 months total.
* In March, April, September, and October, she cuts her lawn 2 times per month.
* In May, June, July, and August, she cuts her lawn 4 times per month.
* Her lawn mower uses 2 gallons of gas every 4th time she cuts her lawn.

Let's calculate the number of times she cuts her lawn in each time period:
* March, April, September, October: 2 times per month x 4 months = 8 times
* May, June, July, August: 4 times per month x 4 months = 16 times

Now, let's calculate the total number of times she cuts her lawn:
* 8 times + 16 times = 24 times

Since her lawn mower uses 2 gallons of gas every 4th time she cuts her lawn, we can calculate the total amount of gas she will need:
* 24 times / 4 = 6 times she will need to refill her lawn mower with 2 gallons of gas
* 6 times x 2 gallons = 12 gallons of gas

Answer: 12 gallons
