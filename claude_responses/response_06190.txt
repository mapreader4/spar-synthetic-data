Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In December, Angela slept 6.5 hours per night.
* There are 31 days in December.
* So, the total amount of sleep Angela got in December was:
    * 6.5 hours per night x 31 nights = 201.5 hours

* In January, Angela slept 8.5 hours per night.
* There are 31 days in January.
* So, the total amount of sleep Angela got in January was:
    * 8.5 hours per night x 31 nights = 263.5 hours

* To calculate the difference in sleep between January and December:
    * 263.5 hours - 201.5 hours = 62 hours

Answer: 62 hours
