Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alberto spent $2457 on a new engine for his car.
* Samara spent:
  - $25 on oil
  - $467 on tires
  - $79 on detailing
* To calculate the total amount Samara spent, we add up the individual expenses:
  - $25 + $467 + $79 = $571
* To calculate the difference between what Alberto and Samara spent, we subtract Samara's total from Alberto's total:
  - $2457 - $571 = $1886

Answer: $1886
