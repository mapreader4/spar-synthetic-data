Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mandy is 3 years old
* Her brother is 4 times as old as she is
* To find her brother's age, we multiply Mandy's age by 4:
    * 3 years x 4 = 12 years
* Her sister is 5 years younger than her brother
* To find her sister's age, we subtract 5 years from her brother's age:
    * 12 years - 5 years = 7 years

Now, to find the age difference between Mandy and her sister, we subtract Mandy's age from her sister's age:
* 7 years - 3 years = 4 years

Answer: 4
