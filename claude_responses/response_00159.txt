Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mario paid $18 for his last haircut on Monday
* Haircuts are 50% more expensive during the weekends
* To find the cost of the haircut the day before (which was on the weekend), we need to increase the weekday price by 50%

To calculate the weekend price:
* Weekday price: $18
* 50% increase: $18 x 1.5 = $27

Therefore, Mario would have paid $27 for the haircut the day before.

Answer: 27
