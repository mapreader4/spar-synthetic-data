Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miguel charges each picker $4 to access the strawberry fields
* The standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20
* Sally, Jenny, and Moses paid a total of $128 for their harvest
* We need to find out how many pounds of strawberries they picked

First, we need to subtract the entrance charge from the total amount they paid:
* $128 - $4 = $124

This means that the total value of the strawberries they picked is $124.

Now, we can divide the total value of the strawberries by the standard price per pound to find the total number of pounds they picked:
* $124 / $20 = 6.2 pounds

Since we cannot have a fractional number of pounds, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 6 pounds
