Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John has 4 jars of 10 caterpillars each, so the total number of caterpillars he has is 4 x 10 = 40 caterpillars.
2) 40% of the caterpillars fail to become butterflies. This means that 40% of 40 caterpillars, which is 0.4 x 40 = 16 caterpillars, fail to become butterflies.
3) The remaining 60% of the caterpillars (60% of 40 = 0.6 x 40 = 24 caterpillars) become butterflies.
4) John sells each butterfly for $3.
5) To calculate the total amount of money he makes, we multiply the number of butterflies (24) by the price per butterfly ($3):
24 butterflies x $3 per butterfly = $72.

Answer: $72.
