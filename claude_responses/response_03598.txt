Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Emma bought 3 dozens of macarons, which is 3 x 12 = 36 pieces of macarons.
2) In addition to the 3 dozens, Emma also bought 10 pieces of macarons.
3) So the total number of macarons Emma bought is 36 + 10 = 46 pieces.
4) It is stated that 15 pieces of macarons are left over.
5) To find the number of macarons that were eaten, we subtract the number of macarons left over (15) from the total number of macarons bought (46).
6) 46 - 15 = 31 pieces of macarons were eaten.
