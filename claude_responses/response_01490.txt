Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tommy ordered a total weight of 10 kilograms of fruits
* He ordered 3 kilograms of apples, 1 kilogram of orange, and 3 kilograms of grapes
* To find the weight of strawberries, we need to subtract the weights of the other fruits from the total weight
* The weights of the other fruits are:
    - Apples: 3 kg
    - Orange: 1 kg
    - Grapes: 3 kg
* Adding these up, we get:
    - 3 kg + 1 kg + 3 kg = 7 kg
* Subtracting this from the total weight of 10 kg, we get:
    - 10 kg - 7 kg = 3 kg

Answer: 3 kilograms
