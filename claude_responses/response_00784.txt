Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brad's pumpkin weighed 54 pounds.
2) Jessica's pumpkin was half the weight of Brad's, so it weighed 54 / 2 = 27 pounds.
3) Betty's pumpkin weighed 4 times the amount of Jessica's, so it weighed 27 * 4 = 108 pounds.
4) The heaviest pumpkin was Betty's at 108 pounds.
5) The lightest pumpkin was Jessica's at 27 pounds.
6) The difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin is 108 - 27 = 81 pounds.

Answer: 81
