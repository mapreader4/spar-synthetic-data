Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We harvested 405 kg of apples.
2) 90 kg were used to make fruit juice.
3) 60 kg were given to a restaurant.
4) The remaining apples were sold in 5 kg bags.
5) The sale of the bags brought in $408.
6) To find the number of bags sold, we take the remaining apples (405 - 90 - 60 = 255 kg) and divide by 5 kg per bag:
255 kg / 5 kg per bag = 51 bags
7) The selling price per bag is the total revenue ($408) divided by the number of bags sold (51):
$408 / 51 bags = $8 per bag

Answer: $8
