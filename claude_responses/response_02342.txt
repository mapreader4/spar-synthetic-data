Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The monthly internet rate is $50
* The customer gets a 5% discount if they pay before the 25th of the month
* The customer paid every 25th of the month for 4 months

To calculate the total amount the customer paid:
1. Calculate the discounted rate for each month:
   * Regular rate: $50
   * Discounted rate: $50 - (5% of $50) = $50 - $2.50 = $47.50
2. Calculate the total amount paid for 4 months:
   * 4 months at the discounted rate of $47.50 per month = $47.50 x 4 = $190

Answer: $190
