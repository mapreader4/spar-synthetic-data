Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The store owner buys clothes wholesale and adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price.
2) The retail price of a pair of pants is $36.
3) To find the wholesale price, we need to work backwards from the retail price.
4) If the store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price, then the wholesale price is 100/180 = 5/9 of the retail price.
5) The retail price is $36, so the wholesale price is 5/9 * $36 = $20.
Answer: 20
