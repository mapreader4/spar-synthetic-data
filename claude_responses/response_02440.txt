Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wally has 400 tickets.
2) He gives 3/4 of his tickets to his two friends, Jensen and Finley.
3) The amount of tickets he gives to Jensen and Finley is 3/4 * 400 = 300 tickets.
4) Jensen and Finley share the tickets in a ratio of 4:11.
5) This means that Jensen gets 4 parts and Finley gets 11 parts.
6) The total number of parts is 4 + 11 = 15.
7) Finley gets 11/15 of the 300 tickets.
8) 11/15 * 300 = 220 tickets.

Answer: 220
