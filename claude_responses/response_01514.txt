Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carla spends 10 minutes sharpening her knife
* She spends 3 times that amount of time peeling vegetables
* To find the time spent peeling vegetables, we multiply the time spent sharpening the knife by 3:
  * 10 minutes x 3 = 30 minutes
* To find the total time spent on these activities, we add the time spent sharpening the knife and the time spent peeling the vegetables:
  * 10 minutes + 30 minutes = 40 minutes

Answer: 40
