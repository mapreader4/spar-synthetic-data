Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Thomas trained for 5 hours every day for a month (30 days)
* So, the total number of hours he trained in the first month is:
  * 5 hours per day x 30 days = 150 hours
* He will continue to train for the next 12 days
* So, the additional number of hours he will train is:
  * 5 hours per day x 12 days = 60 hours
* To find the total number of hours he will spend on training, we add the hours from the first month and the additional 12 days:
  * 150 hours + 60 hours = 210 hours

Answer: 210
