Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 6 members in the book club.
2) Each member pays $150 per year towards snacks.
3) Each member also pays $30 for 6 hardcover books.
4) Each member also pays $12 for 6 paperback books.

To calculate the total amount Niles collects:
1) Snack fees: 6 members x $150 = $900
2) Hardcover book fees: 6 members x $30 = $180
3) Paperback book fees: 6 members x $12 = $72

Adding these together:
$900 + $180 + $72 = $1,152

Answer: $1,152
