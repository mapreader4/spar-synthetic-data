Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, 10 people attended class.
* On Tuesday, 15 people attended class.
* From Wednesday through Friday, 10 people attended class each day.
* To find the average number of people who attended class each day, we need to add up the total number of people who attended class over the 5 days, and then divide that by the number of days.

The total number of people who attended class is:
* Monday: 10 people
* Tuesday: 15 people
* Wednesday through Friday: 10 people per day, so 3 * 10 = 30 people
* Total = 10 + 15 + 30 = 55 people

Now, we divide the total number of people (55) by the number of days (5) to get the average:
* 55 people / 5 days = 11 people per day on average

Answer: 11
