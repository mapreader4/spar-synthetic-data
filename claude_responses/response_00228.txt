Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The company has 200 employees.
2) 60% of the employees drive to work. To calculate this, we take 60% of 200, which is 0.6 * 200 = 120 employees who drive to work.
3) The remaining employees who don't drive to work is 200 - 120 = 80 employees.
4) Of the 80 employees who don't drive to work, half take public transportation. Half of 80 is 40 employees who take public transportation.
5) The difference between the number of employees who drive to work (120) and the number who take public transportation (40) is 120 - 40 = 80.

Answer: 80
