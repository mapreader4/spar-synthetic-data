Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The meat pie costs 2 pfennigs.
2) Gerald has 54 farthings.
3) There are 6 farthings to a pfennig.
4) To calculate how many pfennigs Gerald has, we need to divide the number of farthings by 6:
54 farthings / 6 farthings per pfennig = 9 pfennigs
5) After buying the 2 pfennig pie, Gerald will have 9 pfennigs - 2 pfennigs = 7 pfennigs left.
