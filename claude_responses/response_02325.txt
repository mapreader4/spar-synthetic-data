Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* George sold 3 little cars and a set of Legos
* Each little car was sold for $5
* The total amount earned was $45

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the 3 little cars:
* 3 little cars x $5 per car = $15

Now, we can subtract the amount earned from the little cars from the total amount earned to get the amount earned from the Legos set:
* $45 total - $15 from little cars = $30 from Legos set

Therefore, the Legos set cost $30.

Answer: $30
