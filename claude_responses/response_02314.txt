Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tyler weighs 25 pounds more than Sam.
2) Peter weighs half as much as Tyler.
3) Peter weighs 65 pounds.
4) Since Peter weighs half as much as Tyler, we can calculate Tyler's weight:
   - Tyler's weight = 2 * Peter's weight = 2 * 65 pounds = 130 pounds
5) Now that we know Tyler's weight, we can calculate Sam's weight:
   - Tyler's weight = Sam's weight + 25 pounds
   - 130 pounds = Sam's weight + 25 pounds
   - Sam's weight = 130 pounds - 25 pounds = 105 pounds

Answer: 105 pounds
