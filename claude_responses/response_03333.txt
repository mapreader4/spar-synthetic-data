Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roberta started with 8 vinyl records
* Her friends gave her 12 more records for her birthday
* She bought 30 more records at a garage sale
* So, the total number of records she has is:
  * 8 (initial) + 12 (birthday) + 30 (garage sale) = 50 records
* It takes her 2 days to listen to 1 record
* To find the total number of days it will take her to listen to all 50 records, we multiply the number of records by the number of days per record:
  * 50 records x 2 days/record = 100 days

Answer: 100 days
