Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There is a car collision every 10 seconds
* There is a big crash every 20 seconds
* We want to know the total number of accidents in 4 minutes

First, let's calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes:
* 4 minutes = 240 seconds
* 240 seconds / 10 seconds per collision = 24 car collisions

Next, let's calculate the number of big crashes in 4 minutes:
* 4 minutes = 240 seconds
* 240 seconds / 20 seconds per big crash = 12 big crashes

Finally, to get the total number of accidents, we add the car collisions and big crashes:
* 24 car collisions + 12 big crashes = 36 total accidents

Answer: 36
