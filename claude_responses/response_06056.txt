Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The party was planned to start at 8:00 a.m.
* Paul arrived at 8:25 a.m.
* Amoura arrived 30 minutes later than Paul
* Ingrid was three times later than Amoura

First, let's calculate when Amoura arrived:
* Paul arrived at 8:25 a.m.
* Amoura arrived 30 minutes later than Paul
* So Amoura arrived at 8:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate when Ingrid arrived:
* Ingrid was three times later than Amoura
* Amoura arrived at 8:55 a.m.
* So Ingrid arrived at 9:25 a.m.

Finally, let's calculate how late Ingrid was:
* The party was planned to start at 8:00 a.m.
* Ingrid arrived at 9:25 a.m.
* So Ingrid was 1 hour and 25 minutes late

Answer: 85 minutes
