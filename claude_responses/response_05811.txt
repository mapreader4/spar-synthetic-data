Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In September, Julie charged $4 per hour for mowing lawns. She worked for 25 hours, so her earnings from mowing lawns in September were:
   * 25 hours x $4 per hour = $100

2. In September, Julie charged $8 per hour for pulling weeds. She worked for 3 hours, so her earnings from pulling weeds in September were:
   * 3 hours x $8 per hour = $24

3. So, her total earnings in September were:
   * $100 (mowing lawns) + $24 (pulling weeds) = $124

4. In October, we know that Julie worked the same number of hours as in September, so:
   * Mowing lawns: 25 hours x $4 per hour = $100
   * Pulling weeds: 3 hours x $8 per hour = $24
   * Total earnings in October = $100 + $24 = $124

5. To calculate her total earnings in September and October, we add the earnings from both months:
   * $124 (September) + $124 (October) = $248

Answer: $248
