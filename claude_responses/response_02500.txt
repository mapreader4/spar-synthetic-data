Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Claire wants to make 2 cakes for her mother
* 2 packages of flour are required for making 1 cake
* So, for 2 cakes, she needs 2 x 2 = 4 packages of flour
* The cost of 1 package of flour is $3
* To calculate the total cost of the flour, we multiply the number of packages (4) by the cost per package ($3)
* 4 packages x $3 per package = $12

Answer: $12
