Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Luther made 12 pancakes for breakfast.
2) His family has 8 people.
3) Each person would need 2 pancakes to have a second pancake.
4) So the total number of pancakes needed for everyone to have a second pancake is 8 people x 2 pancakes = 16 pancakes.
5) Since Luther already made 12 pancakes, the number of additional pancakes he must make is 16 pancakes - 12 pancakes = 4 pancakes.
