Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Christine needs 1 pint of paint per door
* She has 8 doors to paint
* So, she needs 8 pints of paint to paint all 8 doors
* If she buys 8 separate pints, each pint costs $8.00
* So, the total cost of 8 pints would be 8 * $8.00 = $64.00
* If she buys a gallon of paint, which is 8 pints, it costs a flat $55.00
* To calculate the savings, we take the cost of 8 pints ($64.00) and subtract the cost of the gallon ($55.00)
* $64.00 - $55.00 = $9.00

Answer: $9.00
