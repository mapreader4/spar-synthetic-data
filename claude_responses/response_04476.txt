Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The family planted 3 times as many peaches as apricots.
2) They planted 58 apricot trees.
3) To find the number of peach trees, we multiply the number of apricot trees by 3:
   * Number of peach trees = 58 x 3 = 174
4) To find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of apricot trees and the number of peach trees:
   * Total number of trees = 58 + 174 = 232

Answer: 232
