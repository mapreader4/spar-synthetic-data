Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom has been getting 5 hours of sleep each weeknight (Monday through Friday)
* That's 5 hours x 5 nights = 25 hours of sleep during the weeknights
* Tom has been getting 6 hours of sleep each weekend night (Saturday and Sunday)
* That's 6 hours x 2 nights = 12 hours of sleep during the weekends
* So in total, Tom has been getting 25 hours + 12 hours = 37 hours of sleep in the last week
* Ideally, Tom would like to get 8 hours of sleep each night, which is 8 hours x 7 nights = 56 hours of sleep in the last week
* The difference between the ideal 56 hours and the actual 37 hours is 56 hours - 37 hours = 19 hours
* Therefore, Tom is 19 hours behind on sleep from the last week.

Answer: 19
