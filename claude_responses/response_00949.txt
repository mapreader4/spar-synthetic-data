Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently.
2) Wanda also weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago.
3) Yola currently weighs 220 pounds.
4) We can use this information to find out how much Yola weighed 2 years ago.
5) Since Wanda weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago, we can subtract 80 pounds from Wanda's weight to find Yola's weight 2 years ago.
6) Wanda's weight = Yola's current weight + 30 pounds = 220 + 30 = 250 pounds.
7) Yola's weight 2 years ago = Wanda's weight - 80 pounds = 250 - 80 = 170 pounds.

Answer: 170
