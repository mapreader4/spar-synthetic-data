Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The business was selling 25 raffle tickets, and each ticket cost $2.00.
2) To calculate the total money raised from the raffle tickets, we multiply the number of tickets (25) by the cost per ticket ($2.00):
   25 tickets x $2.00 per ticket = $50.00
3) In addition to the raffle ticket sales, the business also received 2 $15 donations and a $20 donation.
4) To calculate the total donations, we add up the individual donation amounts:
   2 x $15 = $30.00
   $20.00
   $30.00 + $20.00 = $50.00
5) To calculate the total money raised, we add the raffle ticket sales and the donations:
   $50.00 (raffle tickets) + $50.00 (donations) = $100.00

Answer: 100
