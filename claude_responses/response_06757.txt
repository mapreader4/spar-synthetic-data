Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerry is asking for damages for loss of a $50,000 annual salary for 30 years.
   - The total salary damages would be $50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000.
2) Jerry is also asking for $200,000 in medical bills.
3) The punitive damages are equal to triple the medical and salary damages.
   - The total medical and salary damages are $1,500,000 + $200,000 = $1,700,000.
   - The punitive damages would be 3 x $1,700,000 = $5,100,000.
4) The total amount Jerry is asking for is the sum of the salary damages, medical bills, and punitive damages:
   - $1,500,000 + $200,000 + $5,100,000 = $6,800,000.
5) Jerry is getting 80% of what he's asking for.
   - 80% of $6,800,000 = $5,440,000.

Answer: $5,440,000
