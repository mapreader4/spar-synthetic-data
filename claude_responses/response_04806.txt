Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Melissa is repairing two shoes
* For each shoe, it takes her:
  - 5 minutes to replace the buckle
  - 10 minutes to even out the heel
* To calculate the total time for one shoe:
  - 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes
* To calculate the total time for both shoes:
  - 15 minutes x 2 shoes = 30 minutes

Answer: 30 minutes
