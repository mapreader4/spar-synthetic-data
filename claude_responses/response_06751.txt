Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dennis bought shirts worth $27 from the store.
2) He received 2 $10 bills and $3 in loose coins for his change.
3) The total amount of change he received is:
   - 2 $10 bills = $20
   - $3 in loose coins
   - Total change = $20 + $3 = $23
4) The amount of money Dennis had initially is the sum of the cost of the shirts ($27) and the change he received ($23).
5) Therefore, the amount of money Dennis had initially is:
   - $27 + $23 = $50

Answer: 50
