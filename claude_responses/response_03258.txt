Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Mr Castiel prepared 600 boar sausages on the weekend.
2) On Monday, he ate 2/5 of the 600 sausages. 2/5 of 600 is 240 sausages.
3) After Monday, there are 600 - 240 = 360 sausages remaining.
4) On Tuesday, he ate half of the remaining 360 sausages. Half of 360 is 180 sausages.
5) After Tuesday, there are 360 - 180 = 180 sausages remaining.
6) On Friday, he ate 3/4 of the remaining 180 sausages. 3/4 of 180 is 135 sausages.
7) After Friday, there are 180 - 135 = 45 sausages remaining.

Answer: 45 sausages are left.
