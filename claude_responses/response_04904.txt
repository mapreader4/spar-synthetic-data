Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Lion King cost 10 million to make and earned 200 million at the box office.
2) The profit from The Lion King was 200 million - 10 million = 190 million.
3) The problem states that The Lion King earned a profit that was half of what Star Wars made.
4) So if The Lion King's profit was half of Star Wars' profit, then Star Wars' profit must be 2 times The Lion King's profit, which is 2 * 190 million = 380 million.
5) The problem also states that Star Wars cost 25 million to make.
6) Therefore, the total earnings for Star Wars must be 380 million + 25 million = 405 million.

Answer: 405 million
