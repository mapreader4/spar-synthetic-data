Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The aquarium has 4 dolphins
2) Each dolphin requires 3 hours of training daily
3) So the total number of hours of training required daily is 4 dolphins x 3 hours = 12 hours
4) The aquarium has 2 trainers
5) The trainers want to split the hours they spend training the dolphins equally
6) To find the number of hours each trainer will spend training the dolphins, we divide the total hours of training required (12 hours) by the number of trainers (2)
7) 12 hours / 2 trainers = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
