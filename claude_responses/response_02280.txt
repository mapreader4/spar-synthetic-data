Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Orlan has a 20-meter rope.
2) He gives one-fourth of the rope to Allan.
   * One-fourth of 20 meters is 5 meters.
   * So Orlan now has 20 - 5 = 15 meters of rope left.
3) Orlan then gives two-thirds of the remaining 15 meters to Jack.
   * Two-thirds of 15 meters is 10 meters.
   * So Orlan now has 15 - 10 = 5 meters of rope left.

Answer: 5 meters
