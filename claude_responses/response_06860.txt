Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Calvin started with a weight of 250 pounds
* He lost 8 pounds every month during the training sessions
* We want to find his weight after one year (12 months)

To calculate his weight after one year, we need to subtract the weight he lost each month from his starting weight.
* Weight lost in 1 month = 8 pounds
* Weight lost in 12 months = 8 pounds x 12 months = 96 pounds

Now, we can subtract the total weight lost from his starting weight to get his final weight:
* Starting weight = 250 pounds
* Weight lost = 96 pounds
* Final weight = 250 pounds - 96 pounds = 154 pounds

Answer: 154 pounds
