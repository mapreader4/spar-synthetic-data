Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maria's birthday is in 22 days
* Lilly saves $2 each day until Maria's birthday
* A flower costs $4

To calculate how many flowers Lilly can buy, we need to first find out how much money she will have saved up by the time of Maria's birthday.
* Lilly saves $2 per day
* She saves for 22 days
* So, the total amount she will have saved is: 
$2 per day x 22 days = $44

Now, we need to determine how many flowers she can buy with $44, given that each flower costs $4.
* $44 / $4 per flower = 11 flowers

Therefore, Lilly can buy 11 flowers for Maria's birthday.

Answer: 11
