Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jordan's dog, Max, was born on the same day that Luka turned 4 years old.
2) Luka is exactly 2 years older than Aubrey.
3) We need to find out how old Jordan's dog, Max, was on Aubrey's 8th birthday.
4) Since Luka is 2 years older than Aubrey, that means Aubrey was 6 years old when Luka turned 8.
5) Since Max was born on the same day that Luka turned 4, that means Max was 4 years old when Aubrey turned 8.

Answer: 4 years old.
