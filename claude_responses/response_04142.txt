Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The middle building is 100 feet tall.
2) The building on the left is 80% of the height of the middle one. So, the height of the building on the left is:
   80% of 100 feet = 0.8 * 100 = 80 feet
3) The building on the right is 20 feet shorter than if the building on the left and middle were stacked on top of each other. 
   The height of the building on the left and middle stacked is 100 + 80 = 180 feet.
   The height of the building on the right is 180 - 20 = 160 feet.
4) To calculate the total height, we add the heights of the three buildings:
   100 feet + 80 feet + 160 feet = 340 feet.

Answer: 340
