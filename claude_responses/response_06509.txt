Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each turtle needs 1 ounce of food per 1/2 pound of body weight.
2) Sylvie has 30 pounds of turtles.
3) To find the total amount of food needed, we first need to convert the 30 pounds of turtles to ounces.
   * 30 pounds x 16 ounces per pound = 480 ounces
4) Since each turtle needs 1 ounce of food per 1/2 pound of body weight, we need to divide the total ounces by 0.5 to get the total ounces of food needed.
   * 480 ounces / 0.5 = 960 ounces
5) Each jar of food contains 15 ounces and costs $2.
6) To find the number of jars needed, we divide the total ounces of food needed by the ounces per jar.
   * 960 ounces / 15 ounces per jar = 64 jars
7) To find the total cost, we multiply the number of jars by the cost per jar.
   * 64 jars x $2 per jar = $128

Answer: $128
