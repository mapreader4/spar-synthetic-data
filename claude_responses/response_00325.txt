Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first hour, Bob created 13 questions.
* In the second hour, Bob doubled his rate, so he created 2 x 13 = 26 questions.
* In the third hour, Bob doubled his second hour rate, so he created 2 x 26 = 52 questions.
* To find the total number of questions created in the three hours, we add the questions from each hour:
* 13 + 26 + 52 = 91 questions.

Answer: 91
