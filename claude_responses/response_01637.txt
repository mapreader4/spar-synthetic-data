Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Lennon drove 18 miles. At $0.36 per mile, his reimbursement for Monday would be:
18 miles x $0.36 per mile = $6.48

2. On Tuesday, Lennon drove 26 miles. At $0.36 per mile, his reimbursement for Tuesday would be:
26 miles x $0.36 per mile = $9.36

3. On Wednesday, Lennon drove 20 miles. At $0.36 per mile, his reimbursement for Wednesday would be:
20 miles x $0.36 per mile = $7.20

4. On Thursday, Lennon drove 20 miles. At $0.36 per mile, his reimbursement for Thursday would be:
20 miles x $0.36 per mile = $7.20

5. On Friday, Lennon drove 16 miles. At $0.36 per mile, his reimbursement for Friday would be:
16 miles x $0.36 per mile = $5.76

6. To calculate the total reimbursement, we add up the reimbursements for each day:
$6.48 + $9.36 + $7.20 + $7.20 + $5.76 = $36.00

Answer: $36
