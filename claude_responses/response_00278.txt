Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The price of the home is $98 per square foot.
2) The house is 2,400 square feet.
3) The barn out back is 1,000 square feet.
4) To calculate the total cost of the property, we need to add the cost of the house and the cost of the barn.
5) The cost of the house is 2,400 sq ft x $98 per sq ft = $235,200.
6) The cost of the barn is 1,000 sq ft x $98 per sq ft = $98,000.
7) The total cost of the property is $235,200 + $98,000 = $333,200.

Answer: $333,200
