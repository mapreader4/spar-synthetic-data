Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 60 women at the party.
2) Three-fourths of the women were married, which means 3/4 * 60 = 45 women were married.
3) Each of the 45 married women brought their husbands with them, so there were 45 men at the party.
4) In total, there were 60 women and 45 men at the party.
5) The question states that 3/4 of the men at the party were single, which means 3/4 * 45 = 33.75 men were single. Since we can't have a fractional number of people, we round this down to 33 single men.
6) Adding up the total number of people at the party, we have:
   - 60 women
   - 45 married men
   - 33 single men
   - Total = 60 + 45 + 33 = 138 people

Answer: 138
