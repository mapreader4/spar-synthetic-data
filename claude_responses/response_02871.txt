Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gloria wants to buy a mountain cabin that costs $129,000
* She only has $150 in cash
* She plans to sell her trees to raise the remaining amount
* She has:
  - 20 cypress trees, each worth $100
  - 600 pine trees, each worth $200
  - 24 maple trees, each worth $300
* To calculate the total amount she can raise from selling the trees:
  - Cypress trees: 20 x $100 = $2,000
  - Pine trees: 600 x $200 = $120,000
  - Maple trees: 24 x $300 = $7,200
  - Total from selling trees: $2,000 + $120,000 + $7,200 = $129,200
* So the total amount she can raise is $129,200
* She only needs $129,000 to buy the cabin
* Therefore, the amount of money Gloria will have left after buying the cabin is:
  - $129,200 - $129,000 = $200

Answer: $200
