Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each box of decorations contains:
  - 4 pieces of tinsel
  - 1 Christmas tree
  - 5 snow globes
* 11 families receive a box of decorations
* 1 more box is given to the community center
* To calculate the total number of decorations handed out:
  - For the 11 families:
    - 11 boxes x 4 pieces of tinsel = 44 pieces of tinsel
    - 11 boxes x 1 Christmas tree = 11 Christmas trees
    - 11 boxes x 5 snow globes = 55 snow globes
  - For the 1 box given to the community center:
    - 1 box x 4 pieces of tinsel = 4 pieces of tinsel
    - 1 box x 1 Christmas tree = 1 Christmas tree
    - 1 box x 5 snow globes = 5 snow globes
* Summing up the totals:
  - Total pieces of tinsel: 44 + 4 = 48
  - Total Christmas trees: 11 + 1 = 12
  - Total snow globes: 55 + 5 = 60

Answer: 120 decorations have been handed out.
