Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 boxes of cereal
* The first box holds 14 ounces of cereal
* The second box holds half the amount of the first box, which is 14 / 2 = 7 ounces
* The third box holds 5 ounces more than the second box, which is 7 + 5 = 12 ounces

Now, to find the total amount of cereal in all 3 boxes, we add up the amounts in each box:
* Total cereal = 14 + 7 + 12 = 33 ounces

Answer: 33
