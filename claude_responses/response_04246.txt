Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mabel planted 4 tomato plants
* One plant bore 8 tomatoes
* Another plant bore 4 more tomatoes than the first, so it bore 8 + 4 = 12 tomatoes
* The two remaining plants each bore three times the number of tomatoes as the first two plants combined
* The first two plants bore 8 + 12 = 20 tomatoes
* Each of the remaining two plants bore 3 * 20 = 60 tomatoes
* So the total number of tomatoes Mabel has is:
    - 8 + 12 + 60 + 60 = 140 tomatoes

Answer: 140
