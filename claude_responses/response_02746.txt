Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Al is 25 pounds heavier than Ben. This means that Ben's weight is 25 pounds less than Al's weight.
2) Ben is 16 pounds lighter than Carl. This means that Carl's weight is 16 pounds more than Ben's weight.
3) Ed weighs 146 pounds and is 38 pounds lighter than Al. This means that Al's weight is 38 pounds more than Ed's weight.
4) Putting this all together:
   - Al's weight = Ed's weight + 38 pounds = 146 + 38 = 184 pounds
   - Ben's weight = Al's weight - 25 pounds = 184 - 25 = 159 pounds
   - Carl's weight = Ben's weight + 16 pounds = 159 + 16 = 175 pounds
Answer: 175 pounds
