Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The package contains 20 car washes.
2) The normal cost of a car wash is $15.
3) Since Jim bought a package, he only has to pay 60% of the normal cost.
4) To calculate the total cost of the package, we first need to find the total normal cost of 20 car washes:
   - 20 car washes x $15 per car wash = $300 total normal cost
5) Since Jim only has to pay 60% of the normal cost, we calculate the discounted price:
   - $300 total normal cost x 0.60 = $180 discounted price
Therefore, the amount Jim paid for the package is:
Answer: $180
