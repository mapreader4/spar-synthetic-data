Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The minimum age required to be employed at the company is 25 years.
2) Dara will be half the age of Jane in six years.
3) Jane is currently 28 years old.
4) In six years, Jane will be 28 + 6 = 34 years old.
5) Since Dara will be half the age of Jane in six years, Dara's age in six years will be 34 / 2 = 17 years old.
6) Therefore, Dara's current age is 17 - 6 = 11 years old.
7) The minimum age required to be employed at the company is 25 years.
8) Dara's current age is 11 years old.
9) The difference between the minimum age and Dara's current age is 25 - 11 = 14 years.
