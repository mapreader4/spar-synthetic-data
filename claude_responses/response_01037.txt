Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John bought a gaming PC for $1200
* He then sold the old video card for $300
* He bought a new video card for $500
* To calculate the total amount he spent on the computer, we need to add the cost of the PC ($1200) and the cost of the new video card ($500), and then subtract the amount he received from selling the old video card ($300)
* $1200 + $500 - $300 = $1400
* Therefore, the total amount of money John spent on his computer, counting the savings from selling the old card, is:
Answer: $1400
