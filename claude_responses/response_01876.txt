Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carl knows 50 people will show up for the open house
* He's hoping another 40 people will randomly show up
* So the total number of people expected to visit is 50 + 40 = 90
* He's created 10 extravagant gift bags for the first 10 people
* He's made average gift bags for 20 people
* So the total number of gift bags he's already made is 10 + 20 = 30
* He needs to make enough gift bags for everyone who visits, which is 90 people
* Therefore, the number of additional gift bags he needs to make is 90 - 30 = 60

Answer: 60
