Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The grocery store has 4 kinds of jelly: grape, strawberry, raspberry, and plum.
2) Grape jelly sells twice as much as strawberry jelly.
3) Raspberry jelly sells twice as much as plum jelly.
4) Raspberry jelly sells a third as much as grape jelly.
5) They sold 6 jars of plum jelly today.

To find the number of jars of strawberry jelly sold, we can use the given information to work backwards.

Since raspberry jelly sells twice as much as plum jelly, and they sold 6 jars of plum jelly, that means they sold 12 jars of raspberry jelly.

Since raspberry jelly sells a third as much as grape jelly, that means they sold 36 jars of grape jelly (12 x 3 = 36).

Since grape jelly sells twice as much as strawberry jelly, that means they sold 18 jars of strawberry jelly (36 / 2 = 18).

Answer: 18
