Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first recipe calls for 2 cups of lower sodium soy sauce.
2) The second recipe calls for 1 cup of lower sodium soy sauce.
3) The third recipe calls for 3 cups of lower sodium soy sauce.
4) In total, Stephanie needs 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 cups of lower sodium soy sauce.
5) Since there are 8 ounces in 1 cup, 6 cups of lower sodium soy sauce is equivalent to 6 * 8 = 48 ounces.
6) Each bottle of lower sodium soy sauce holds 16 ounces.
7) To determine how many bottles Stephanie should buy, we divide the total ounces needed (48) by the ounces per bottle (16):
48 ounces / 16 ounces per bottle = 3 bottles.
