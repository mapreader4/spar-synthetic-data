Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each pill has 50 mg of Vitamin A
* The recommended daily serving of Vitamin A is 200 mg
* We need to find how many pills Ryan needs to hit the recommended amount for the week

First, let's calculate the recommended amount of Vitamin A for the week:
* Recommended daily serving: 200 mg
* Number of days in a week: 7
* Recommended amount for the week: 200 mg x 7 days = 1,400 mg

Now, let's calculate how many pills Ryan needs to hit the recommended amount for the week:
* Each pill has 50 mg of Vitamin A
* Recommended amount for the week: 1,400 mg
* Number of pills needed: 1,400 mg / 50 mg per pill = 28 pills

Answer: 28 pills
