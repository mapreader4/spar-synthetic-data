Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* For a normal car:
  - 4 minutes for washing the windows
  - 7 minutes for washing the car body
  - 4 minutes for cleaning the tires
  - 9 minutes for waxing the car
  - Total time for a normal car = 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 24 minutes
* For the big SUV:
  - Since it took twice as long as a normal car, the total time for the big SUV = 2 * 24 = 48 minutes
* William washed 2 normal cars and 1 big SUV this morning
  - Time for 2 normal cars = 2 * 24 = 48 minutes
  - Time for 1 big SUV = 48 minutes
  - Total time = 48 + 48 = 96 minutes

Answer: 96 minutes
