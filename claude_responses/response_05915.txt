Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael bought 6 crates of eggs on Tuesday
* Each crate holds 30 eggs
* So, the total number of eggs he bought on Tuesday is:
6 crates x 30 eggs/crate = 180 eggs
* He then gave 2 crates to Susan
* 2 crates x 30 eggs/crate = 60 eggs given to Susan
* So, the number of eggs Michael had left after giving 2 crates to Susan is:
180 eggs - 60 eggs = 120 eggs
* On Thursday, Michael bought another 5 crates of eggs
* 5 crates x 30 eggs/crate = 150 more eggs
* So, the total number of eggs Michael has now is:
120 eggs + 150 eggs = 270 eggs

Answer: 270
