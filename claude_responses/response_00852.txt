Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Initially, there are 50 ants in the jar.
* The number of ants in the jar doubles each hour.
* After 1 hour, the number of ants will be 50 x 2 = 100 ants.
* After 2 hours, the number of ants will be 100 x 2 = 200 ants.
* After 3 hours, the number of ants will be 200 x 2 = 400 ants.
* After 4 hours, the number of ants will be 400 x 2 = 800 ants.
* After 5 hours, the number of ants will be 800 x 2 = 1600 ants.

Answer: 1600
