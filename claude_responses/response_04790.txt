Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) In five years, Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe.
2) Rehana is currently 25 years old.
3) In five years, Rehana will be 25 + 5 = 30 years old.
4) Since Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe in five years, we can say that Phoebe's age in five years will be 30 / 3 = 10 years old.
5) Therefore, Phoebe's current age is 10 - 5 = 5 years old.
6) Jacob, Rehana's brother, is 3/5 of Phoebe's current age.
7) Phoebe's current age is 5 years old.
8) 3/5 of 5 is 3 * 5 / 5 = 3 years old.
