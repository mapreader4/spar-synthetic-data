Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Isabel had some amount of money in her piggy bank to start with.
2) She spent half of that amount on a toy.
3) After buying the toy, she had the remaining half of the original amount left.
4) She then spent half of the remaining amount on a book for her brother.
5) After buying the book, she had $51 left.

Let's call the original amount of money in the piggy bank 'x'.

Step 1: She spent half of x on the toy, so she had x/2 left.
Step 2: She then spent half of x/2 on the book, so she had (x/2)/2 = x/4 left.
Step 3: We know she has $51 left, so x/4 = $51.
Step 4: Solving for x, we get x = $204.

Answer: $204
