Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Genevieve picked some cherries that cost $8 per kilogram
* She was $400 short of the total price
* Genevieve had $1600 on her

To find the total price of the cherries, we can add the $400 she was short to the $1600 she had:
* Total price = $1600 + $400 = $2000

Now, we can find the number of kilograms of cherries she bought by dividing the total price by the price per kilogram:
* Kilograms of cherries = $2000 / $8 per kilogram = 250 kilograms

Answer: 250
