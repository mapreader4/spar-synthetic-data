To solve this problem, we need to find the total duration of the video and then divide it by the number of players to get the average time for each player.

Given information:
- Point guard: 130 seconds
- Shooting guard: 145 seconds
- Small forward: 85 seconds
- Power forward: 60 seconds
- Center: 180 seconds

Step 1: Calculate the total duration of the video.
Total duration = Point guard (130 seconds) + Shooting guard (145 seconds) + Small forward (85 seconds) + Power forward (60 seconds) + Center (180 seconds)
Total duration = 130 + 145 + 85 + 60 + 180 = 600 seconds

Step 2: Convert the total duration from seconds to minutes.
Total duration in minutes = 600 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 10 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the average time for each player.
Average time per player = Total duration in minutes / Number of players
Average time per player = 10 minutes / 5 players = 2 minutes

Answer: 2 minutes
