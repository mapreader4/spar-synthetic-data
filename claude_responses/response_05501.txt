Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Originally, there were 32 green apples in the store.
2) There are 200 more red apples than green apples in the store.
3) This means that the original number of red apples was 32 + 200 = 232 red apples.
4) A truck then delivered 340 more green apples.
5) So the new total number of green apples is 32 + 340 = 372 green apples.
6) The new total number of red apples is still 232.
7) The difference between the green apples and red apples is now 372 - 232 = 140 more green apples than red apples.

Answer: 140
