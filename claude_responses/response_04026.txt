Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung.
2) Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu.
3) Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.
4) So, Mr. Phung has 56 + 16 = 72 silver dollars.
5) Mr. Ha has 72 + 5 = 77 silver dollars.
6) The total number of silver dollars the three have is:
56 + 72 + 77 = 205.
