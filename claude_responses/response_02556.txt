Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 1 white rhino weighs 5100 pounds
* 7 white rhinos would weigh 7 * 5100 = 35,700 pounds
* 1 black rhino weighs 1 ton
* 1 ton = 2,000 pounds
* 8 black rhinos would weigh 8 * 2,000 = 16,000 pounds
* To find the total weight, we add the weights of the white rhinos and black rhinos:
* 35,700 pounds + 16,000 pounds = 51,700 pounds

Answer: 51,700 pounds
