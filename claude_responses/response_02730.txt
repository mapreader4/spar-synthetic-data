Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers
* In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers
* Each of them planted the same number of flowers

To find the number of flowers James planted in a day, we need to:
1. Find the total number of people who planted the flowers
2. Divide the total number of flowers planted by the total number of people
3. Divide the result by the number of days

Step 1: The total number of people who planted the flowers is 5 (James and 4 of his friends).

Step 2: The total number of flowers planted is 200. Dividing this by the total number of people (5), we get 40 flowers per person.

Step 3: Since they planted the flowers in 2 days, we divide the number of flowers per person (40) by the number of days (2) to get the number of flowers James planted in a day.

Answer: 20 flowers
