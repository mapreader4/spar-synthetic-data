Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Annie bought 5 televisions, each costing $50.
2) The total cost of the televisions is 5 x $50 = $250.
3) Annie spent a total of $260.
4) The remaining amount spent is $260 - $250 = $10.
5) Annie also bought 10 figurines.
6) The cost of a single figurine is the remaining amount spent ($10) divided by the number of figurines (10).
7) Therefore, the cost of a single figurine is $10 / 10 = $1.
