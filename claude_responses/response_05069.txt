Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jake buys 2-pound packages of sausages
* He buys 3 of these packages
* Each package costs $4 per pound

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the total weight of the sausages:
   * 3 packages x 2 pounds per package = 6 pounds of sausages
2. Calculate the total cost:
   * 6 pounds of sausages x $4 per pound = $24

Therefore, the total amount Jake pays is:
Answer: $24
