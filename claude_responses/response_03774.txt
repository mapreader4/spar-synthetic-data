Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James's bag weighs 18kg.
2) Each of Oliver's bags weighs 1/6 as much as James's bag.
3) To find the weight of each of Oliver's bags, we divide James's bag weight (18kg) by 6:
18kg / 6 = 3kg
4) Oliver has two bags, so the combined weight of both of his bags is:
2 x 3kg = 6kg
Answer: 6kg
