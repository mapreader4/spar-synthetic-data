Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We are given that Felipe and Emilio needed a combined time of 7.5 years to build their homes.
2) We are also given that Felipe finished in half the time of Emilio.
3) Let's say Emilio took x years to build his house.
4) Then, Felipe took x/2 years to build his house.
5) The combined time is 7.5 years, so we can write the equation:
x + x/2 = 7.5
6) Solving for x, we get:
3x/2 = 7.5
x = 5 years
7) Since Felipe took half the time of Emilio, it took him 5/2 = 2.5 years to build his house.
8) To convert this to months, we multiply by 12:
2.5 years * 12 months/year = 30 months.

Answer: 30 months.
