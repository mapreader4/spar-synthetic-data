Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John is allowed to watch cartoons for 2 hours on Sundays
* For every 10 minutes of cartoons, he has to do 8 minutes of chores
* To find the total minutes of chores, we need to first find the total minutes of cartoons

First, we convert the 2 hours of cartoons to minutes:
* 2 hours = 120 minutes

Now, we can use the ratio of 10 minutes of cartoons to 8 minutes of chores to find the total minutes of chores:
* 120 minutes of cartoons / 10 minutes = 12 sets of 10 minutes
* 12 sets of 10 minutes x 8 minutes of chores = 96 minutes of chores

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 96 minutes
