Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Randolph is 5 years older than Sydney.
2) Sydney is twice as old as Sherry.
3) Sherry is 25 years old.

First, let's find Sydney's age:
* Since Sydney is twice as old as Sherry, and Sherry is 25, then Sydney must be 2 x 25 = 50 years old.

Now, let's find Randolph's age:
* Randolph is 5 years older than Sydney, and Sydney is 50 years old.
* Therefore, Randolph must be 50 + 5 = 55 years old.

Answer: 55
