Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bryan bought 5 t-shirts and 4 pairs of pants
* The total cost for the 5 t-shirts and 4 pairs of pants is $1500
* We know that each t-shirt costs $100
* To find the cost of each pair of pants, we need to first find the total cost of the t-shirts
* The total cost of the 5 t-shirts is 5 * $100 = $500
* Now we can subtract the cost of the t-shirts from the total cost to find the cost of the pants:
* $1500 - $500 = $1000
* Since there are 4 pairs of pants, we can divide the cost of the pants by 4 to find the cost of each pair:
* $1000 / 4 = $250

Answer: $250
