To solve this problem, we need to find the total increase in population from 2000 to 2005, and then divide it by the number of years to get the average number of people added each year.

Given information:
- In 2000, the population of Maryville was about 450,000 people.
- In 2005, the population of Maryville was about 467,000 people.

Step 1: Find the total increase in population from 2000 to 2005.
Total increase in population = 2005 population - 2000 population
Total increase in population = 467,000 - 450,000 = 17,000 people

Step 2: Find the number of years between 2000 and 2005.
Number of years = 2005 - 2000 = 5 years

Step 3: Calculate the average number of people added each year.
Average number of people added each year = Total increase in population / Number of years
Average number of people added each year = 17,000 / 5 = 3,400 people

Answer: 3,400 people
