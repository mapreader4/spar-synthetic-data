Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harper drinks 1/2 bottle of mineral water per day
* Each case contains 24 bottles
* The cases are currently on sale for $12.00 each
* Harper wants to buy enough cases to last her 240 days

First, we need to calculate how many bottles Harper will need for 240 days:
* 1/2 bottle per day x 240 days = 120 bottles

Next, we need to determine how many cases she needs to buy to get 120 bottles:
* 120 bottles / 24 bottles per case = 5 cases

Finally, we can calculate the total cost:
* 5 cases x $12.00 per case = $60.00

Answer: $60.00
