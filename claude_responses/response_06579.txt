Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Megan participated in a total of 100 plays
* She was the lead actress in 80% of her work
* To find the number of times she was not the lead actress, we need to find the number of plays where she was not the lead actress

First, let's find the number of plays where she was the lead actress:
* 80% of 100 plays = 0.80 * 100 = 80 plays

Now, we can find the number of plays where she was not the lead actress:
* Total plays - Plays where she was the lead actress = 100 - 80 = 20 plays

Answer: 20
