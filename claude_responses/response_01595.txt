Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* With 40 seconds left in the game, the Dunkinville Hornets were leading the Fredingo Fireflies by a score of 86 to 74.
* In the remaining 40 seconds, the Fireflies scored 7 three-point baskets.
* 7 three-point baskets = 7 x 3 = 21 points for the Fireflies.
* The Hornets scored 2 two-point baskets in the remaining 40 seconds.
* 2 two-point baskets = 2 x 2 = 4 points for the Hornets.
* The final score was Fireflies 74 + 21 = 95 and Hornets 86 + 4 = 90.
* Therefore, the Fireflies scored 95 - 90 = 5 more points than the Hornets.
