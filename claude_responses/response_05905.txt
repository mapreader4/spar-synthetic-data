Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 10 dishes on the menu
* 2 dishes have beans and lentils
* 2 dishes have beans and seitan
* The remaining 6 dishes have only one kind of protein
* Half of the remaining 6 dishes have only beans
* There are three times as many dishes with only beans as with only seitan

First, let's find out how many dishes have only beans:
* 6 remaining dishes
* Half of 6 is 3
* So there are 3 dishes with only beans

Now, let's find out how many dishes have only seitan:
* There are three times as many dishes with only beans as with only seitan
* So if there are 3 dishes with only beans, there must be 1 dish with only seitan

Finally, we can calculate the number of dishes that include lentils:
* 2 dishes have beans and lentils
* Therefore, the answer is 2

Answer: 2
