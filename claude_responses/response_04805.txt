Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 40 chess players on the island of Castor
* A quarter of the island's chess players have never lost to an AI
* To find the number of people who have lost to a computer at least once, we need to find the number of people who have not lost to an AI, and then subtract that from the total number of chess players

First, let's find the number of people who have never lost to an AI:
* A quarter of 40 is 40 * 1/4 = 10
* So, 10 people on the island have never lost to an AI

Now, to find the number of people who have lost to a computer at least once, we subtract the number of people who have never lost to an AI from the total number of chess players:
* 40 - 10 = 30

Answer: 30
