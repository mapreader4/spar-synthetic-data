Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The drive to the beach takes 2 hours.
2) The drive back from the beach also takes 2 hours.
3) The total driving time is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.
4) Jake spends 2.5 times as long at the beach as his total driving time.
5) The time spent at the beach is 2.5 * 4 hours = 10 hours.
6) The total time for the trip is the driving time plus the time spent at the beach.
7) The total time for the trip is 4 hours + 10 hours = 14 hours.
