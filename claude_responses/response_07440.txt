Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes, with 65 cupcakes in each batch
* So the total number of cupcakes Carla made is 45 * 65 = 2,925 cupcakes
* Carla then took 5 cupcakes from each batch and fed them to her dogs
* So the number of cupcakes Carla fed to her dogs is 45 * 5 = 225 cupcakes
* The remaining number of cupcakes is 2,925 - 225 = 2,700 cupcakes
* Carla's daughter had 19 friends, and they shared the remaining cupcakes equally among them, including the daughter
* So the number of people sharing the remaining cupcakes is 20 (19 friends + 1 daughter)
* The number of cupcakes each person ate is 2,700 / 20 = 135 cupcakes

Answer: 135
