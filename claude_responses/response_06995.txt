Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Bill thought he bought 70 chihuahuas
2) Some of them turned out to be rats
3) The number of rats was 6 times the number of chihuahuas
4) Let's call the number of chihuahuas x
5) Then the number of rats is 6x
6) The total number of animals Bill bought is 70
7) So x + 6x = 70
8) 7x = 70
9) x = 10
10) Therefore, the number of rats Bill bought is 6 * 10 = 60

Answer: 60
