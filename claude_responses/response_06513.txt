Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Julio can catch 7 fish every hour.
2) He goes fishing for 9 hours.
3) So, in 9 hours, he would have caught 7 fish x 9 hours = 63 fish.
4) However, he loses 15 fish in the process.
5) So, the total number of fish Julio has is 63 fish - 15 fish = 48 fish.

Answer: 48
