Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roger rode his bike for 2 miles in the morning
* In the evening, he rode 5 times that amount
* To calculate the evening distance, we take the morning distance (2 miles) and multiply it by 5:
  * 2 miles x 5 = 10 miles
* To find the total distance Roger rode his bike, we add the morning and evening distances:
  * 2 miles + 10 miles = 12 miles

Answer: 12
