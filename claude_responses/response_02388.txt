Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Apples cost $40 per dozen
* Hank bought 14 dozen apples
* So the cost of the apples is:
    - 14 dozen x $40 per dozen = $560
* Pears cost $50 per dozen
* Hank bought 14 dozen pears
* So the cost of the pears is:
    - 14 dozen x $50 per dozen = $700
* To calculate the total amount Hank spent, we add the cost of the apples and the cost of the pears:
    - $560 + $700 = $1,260

Answer: 1260
