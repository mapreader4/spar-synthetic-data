Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Friday, Tameka sold 40 boxes.
2. On Saturday, she sold 10 fewer than twice the number she sold on Friday.
   - Twice the number she sold on Friday is 2 x 40 = 80.
   - 10 fewer than 80 is 80 - 10 = 70.
   - So on Saturday, she sold 70 boxes.
3. On Sunday, she sold half as many as she sold on Saturday.
   - On Saturday, she sold 70 boxes.
   - Half of 70 is 70 / 2 = 35.
   - So on Sunday, she sold 35 boxes.

Now, to find the total number of boxes she sold over the three days, we add up the boxes sold on each day:
Friday: 40 boxes
Saturday: 70 boxes
Sunday: 35 boxes

Total boxes sold = 40 + 70 + 35 = 145 boxes

Answer: 145
