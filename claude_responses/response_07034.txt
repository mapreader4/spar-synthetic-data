Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emily caught 4 trout, each weighing 2 pounds. So the total weight of the trout is:
4 trout x 2 pounds per trout = 8 pounds
2) Emily caught 3 catfish, each weighing 1.5 pounds. So the total weight of the catfish is:
3 catfish x 1.5 pounds per catfish = 4.5 pounds
3) Emily caught 5 bluegills, each weighing 2.5 pounds. So the total weight of the bluegills is:
5 bluegills x 2.5 pounds per bluegill = 12.5 pounds
4) To find the total pounds of fish caught, we add up the weights of the trout, catfish, and bluegills:
8 pounds + 4.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds = 25 pounds

Answer: 25 pounds
