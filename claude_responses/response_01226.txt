Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Nina charges $25.00 for each necklace, and she sold 5 necklaces.
   * Revenue from necklaces: 5 x $25.00 = $125.00

2. Nina charges $15.00 for each bracelet, and she sold 10 bracelets.
   * Revenue from bracelets: 10 x $15.00 = $150.00

3. Nina charges $10.00 for a pair of earrings, and she sold 20 pairs of earrings.
   * Revenue from earrings: 20 x $10.00 = $200.00

4. Nina charges $45.00 for a complete jewelry ensemble, and she received 2 orders.
   * Revenue from jewelry ensembles: 2 x $45.00 = $90.00

5. To calculate the total revenue, we add up the revenue from each item:
   * Total revenue = $125.00 + $150.00 + $200.00 + $90.00 = $565.00

Answer: $565.00
