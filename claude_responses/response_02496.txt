Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The swag bag includes:
  - 2 diamond earrings that cost $6,000 each
  - 1 new iPhone that costs $2,000
  - Some designer scarves that each cost $1,500
* The total value of the swag bag is $20,000
* To find the number of scarves, we need to first calculate the total value of the other items in the bag:
  - 2 diamond earrings at $6,000 each = $12,000
  - 1 new iPhone at $2,000 = $2,000
  - Total value of the earrings and iPhone = $12,000 + $2,000 = $14,000
* Now we can subtract the value of the earrings and iPhone from the total value of the swag bag to get the value of the scarves:
  - Value of the scarves = $20,000 - $14,000 = $6,000
* Since each scarf costs $1,500, we can divide the total value of the scarves by the cost of each scarf to get the number of scarves:
  - Number of scarves = $6,000 / $1,500 = 4
