Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. There are 4 people total (Bret and his 3 co-workers)
2. Each main meal costs $12.00
3. They ordered 4 main meals, so the total cost of the main meals is 4 * $12.00 = $48.00
4. They also ordered 2 appetizers at $6.00 each, so the total cost of the appetizers is 2 * $6.00 = $12.00
5. The total cost of the food is $48.00 + $12.00 = $60.00
6. They added a 20% tip, which is 0.20 * $60.00 = $12.00
7. They also added an extra $5.00 for a rush order
8. The total amount Bret spent on dinner is $60.00 + $12.00 + $5.00 = $77.00

Answer: $77
