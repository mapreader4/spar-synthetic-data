Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The initial ride fee is $2.
2) The distance of the ride is 4 miles.
3) The taxi charge per mile is $2.5.
4) To calculate the total cost, we need to add the initial ride fee and the charge for the 4 miles.
5) The charge for the 4 miles is 4 * $2.5 = $10.
6) The total cost is the initial ride fee ($2) plus the charge for the 4 miles ($10).
7) Therefore, the total amount Michelle paid for her ride is $2 + $10 = $12.
