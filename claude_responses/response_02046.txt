Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each bank teller has 10 rolls of coins
* Each roll has 25 coins
* We want to find the total number of coins that 4 bank tellers have

First, let's find the total number of coins that one bank teller has:
* 10 rolls x 25 coins per roll = 250 coins per teller

Now, to find the total number of coins that 4 bank tellers have, we multiply the number of coins per teller by the number of tellers:
* 250 coins per teller x 4 tellers = 1,000 coins

Answer: 1,000
