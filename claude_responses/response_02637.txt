Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sheena can sew one dress in 12 hours.
2) There are 5 bridesmaids, so she needs to sew 5 dresses.
3) Sheena sews the dresses 4 hours each week.
4) To calculate the total time it will take her to complete the 5 dresses, we need to find how many hours it will take her in total.
5) Since she can sew one dress in 12 hours, it will take her 5 * 12 = 60 hours to sew all 5 dresses.
6) Since she sews 4 hours per week, it will take her 60 / 4 = 15 weeks to complete the dresses.
