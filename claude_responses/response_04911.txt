Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ajax's current weight is 80 kilograms
* 1 kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds
* Exercising for 1 hour will help him lose 1.5 pounds
* He plans to exercise for 2 hours every day for two weeks (14 days)

First, we need to convert Ajax's weight from kilograms to pounds:
* 80 kilograms x 2.2 pounds/kilogram = 176 pounds

Now, we can calculate how much weight he will lose by exercising for 2 hours per day for 14 days:
* 1.5 pounds lost per hour of exercise
* 2 hours of exercise per day
* 14 days of exercise
* 1.5 pounds/hour x 2 hours/day x 14 days = 42 pounds lost

Finally, we can subtract the weight he lost from his original weight to get his new weight:
* 176 pounds - 42 pounds = 134 pounds

Answer: 134 pounds
