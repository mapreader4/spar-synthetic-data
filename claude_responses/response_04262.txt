Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Day 1:
* Barry and Jim traveled at 5 miles per hour for 7 hours
* So, on the first day, they traveled 5 miles per hour x 7 hours = 35 miles

Day 2:
* They traveled at 6 miles per hour for 6 hours, which is 6 miles per hour x 6 hours = 36 miles
* Then they traveled at half that speed (3 miles per hour) for 3 hours, which is 3 miles per hour x 3 hours = 9 miles
* So, on the second day, they traveled 36 miles + 9 miles = 45 miles

Day 3:
* They traveled for 5 hours at 7 miles per hour
* So, on the third day, they traveled 7 miles per hour x 5 hours = 35 miles

Now, to calculate the total distance traveled:
* Day 1: 35 miles
* Day 2: 45 miles
* Day 3: 35 miles
* Total distance traveled = 35 miles + 45 miles + 35 miles = 115 miles

Answer: 115 miles
