Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We have 2 dogs that each bark 30 times per minute.
2) To find the total number of barks in 10 minutes, we need to multiply the number of barks per minute by the number of minutes.
3) Each dog barks 30 times per minute, so the total number of barks per minute for the 2 dogs is 2 * 30 = 60 barks per minute.
4) In 10 minutes, the total number of barks would be 60 barks per minute * 10 minutes = 600 barks.

Answer: 600
