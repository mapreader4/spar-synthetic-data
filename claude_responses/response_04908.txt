Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Ali's closet can fit 200 pairs of jeans.
2) Each of Noah's closets can fit 1/4 as much as Ali's closet.
3) Since Ali's closet can fit 200 pairs of jeans, each of Noah's closets can fit 1/4 of 200, which is 50 pairs of jeans.
4) Noah has two closets, so the total number of jeans that can fit in both of Noah's closets is 50 + 50 = 100.

Answer: 100
