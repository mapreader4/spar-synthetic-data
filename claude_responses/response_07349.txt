Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kara mixes cups of sugar and water in the ratio of 1:2 to make one liter of lemonade
* This means that for every 1 cup of sugar, she uses 2 cups of water
* The total number of cups used is 84 cups
* We need to find the number of cups of sugar used
* Since the ratio of sugar to water is 1:2, we can set up the following equation:
* Let x = number of cups of sugar
* Then 2x = number of cups of water
* The total number of cups is 84, so:
* x + 2x = 84
* 3x = 84
* x = 28

Answer: 28 cups of sugar were used.
