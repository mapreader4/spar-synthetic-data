Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) John invests $1000 in the bank.
2) The bank offers a simple interest rate of 10% per year.
3) Simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * r * t, where I is the interest earned, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.
4) In this case, P = $1000, r = 0.10 (10%), and t = 3 years.
5) Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
I = $1000 * 0.10 * 3 = $300
6) The total amount John has after 3 years is the principal amount plus the interest earned:
$1000 + $300 = $1300
Answer: $1300
