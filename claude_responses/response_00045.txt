Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The unicorn piñata cost $13.
2. They bought 4 bags of Reese's at $9 per bag. So the total cost of the Reese's is 4 * $9 = $36.
3. They bought 3 bags of Snickers at $5 per bag. So the total cost of the Snickers is 3 * $5 = $15.
4. They bought 5 bags of Skittles at $7 per bag. So the total cost of the Skittles is 5 * $7 = $35.

Now, to find the total cost, we add up the cost of the piñata and the treats:
$13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99

Answer: 99
