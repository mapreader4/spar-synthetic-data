Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lucille's house is 80 feet tall.
2) The first neighbor's house is 70 feet tall.
3) The second neighbor's house is 99 feet tall.
4) To find the average height of the houses, we add up the heights and divide by the number of houses:
   (80 + 70 + 99) / 3 = 249 / 3 = 83 feet
5) To find how much shorter Lucille's house is than the average, we subtract Lucille's house height from the average height:
   83 feet - 80 feet = 3 feet
