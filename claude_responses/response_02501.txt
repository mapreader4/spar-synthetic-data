Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Ann is currently 6 years old.
2) Tom is currently two times older than Ann, so Tom is 6 x 2 = 12 years old.
3) 10 years later, Ann will be 6 + 10 = 16 years old.
4) 10 years later, Tom will be 12 + 10 = 22 years old.
5) The sum of their ages 10 years later will be 16 + 22 = 38.

Answer: 38
