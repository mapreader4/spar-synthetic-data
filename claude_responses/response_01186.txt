Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John needs to get permits, which cost $250.

2. He hires a contractor who charges $150 per hour, and the contractor works for 3 days at 5 hours per day.
   * 3 days x 5 hours per day = 15 hours
   * 15 hours x $150 per hour = $2,250

3. He also pays an inspector, who is paid 80% less than the contractor.
   * Contractor's hourly rate: $150
   * Inspector's hourly rate: $150 x (1 - 0.8) = $30 per hour

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = Permits + Contractor cost + Inspector cost
Total cost = $250 + $2,250 + ($30 per hour x 15 hours)
Total cost = $250 + $2,250 + $450
Total cost = $2,950

Answer: $2,950
