Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lexie picked 12 apples
* Tom picked twice as many apples as Lexie
* To find how many apples Tom picked, we multiply Lexie's 12 apples by 2:
* Tom picked 12 x 2 = 24 apples
* Now, to find the total number of apples they collected, we add Lexie's 12 apples and Tom's 24 apples:
* 12 + 24 = 36 apples

Answer: 36
