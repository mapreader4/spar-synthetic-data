Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Blanche found 12 pieces of green and 3 pieces of red sea glass.
2. Rose found 9 pieces of red and 11 pieces of blue sea glass.
3. Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose, and three times as much blue sea glass as Rose.

First, let's calculate the total number of red glass pieces that Blanche and Rose found:
* Blanche found 3 pieces of red glass
* Rose found 9 pieces of red glass
* Total red glass pieces found by Blanche and Rose = 3 + 9 = 12 pieces

Now, Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose, so:
* Dorothy found 2 x 12 = 24 pieces of red glass

Next, let's calculate the total number of blue glass pieces that Rose found:
* Rose found 11 pieces of blue glass

Dorothy found three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, so:
* Dorothy found 3 x 11 = 33 pieces of blue glass

Therefore, the total number of pieces of sea glass that Dorothy found is:
* 24 pieces of red glass + 33 pieces of blue glass = 57 pieces

Answer: 57
