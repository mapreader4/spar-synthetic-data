Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Normally, Ann can frost a cake in 5 minutes
* With her sprained wrist, it takes her 8 minutes to frost a cake
* We need to find how much longer it would take her to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist

First, let's calculate how long it would normally take her to frost 10 cakes:
* 10 cakes x 5 minutes per cake = 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate how long it would take her with her sprained wrist:
* 10 cakes x 8 minutes per cake = 80 minutes

To find the difference in time:
* 80 minutes - 50 minutes = 30 minutes

Answer: 30
