Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Robert buys 4 pens
* Julia buys three times as many pens as Robert, so Julia buys 3 x 4 = 12 pens
* Dorothy buys half as many pens as Julia, so Dorothy buys 12 / 2 = 6 pens
* Each pen costs $1.50
* To calculate the total amount spent:
    - Robert spent 4 x $1.50 = $6
    - Julia spent 12 x $1.50 = $18
    - Dorothy spent 6 x $1.50 = $9
* Adding up the amounts spent by each person:
    - Total spent = $6 + $18 + $9 = $33

Answer: $33
