Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Louise has 20 red pencils
* She has twice as many blue pencils as red pencils, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 blue pencils
* She has 40 yellow pencils
* She has as many green pencils as she has red and blue pencils combined, so that's 20 + 40 = 60 green pencils

Now, we need to calculate the total number of pencils:
* Total pencils = 20 red + 40 blue + 40 yellow + 60 green = 160 pencils

Each box holds 20 pencils, so to calculate the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the capacity of each box:
* Number of boxes needed = 160 pencils / 20 pencils per box = 8 boxes

Answer: 8
