Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Sarah buys 20 pencils.
* On Tuesday, she buys 18 more pencils.
* On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she bought on Tuesday.
* The number of pencils she bought on Tuesday was 18.
* So on Wednesday, she bought 3 x 18 = 54 pencils.
* To find the total number of pencils she has, we add up the pencils she bought on each day:
* Monday: 20 pencils
* Tuesday: 18 pencils
* Wednesday: 54 pencils
* Total: 20 + 18 + 54 = 92 pencils

Answer: 92
