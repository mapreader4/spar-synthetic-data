Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sally gave Don 10oz of rum on his pancakes
* Don can consume a maximum of 3 times that amount of rum for a healthy diet
* 3 times 10oz is 30oz
* Don had already consumed 12oz of rum earlier that day
* To find the amount of rum Don can have after eating all the rum and pancakes, we need to subtract the 12oz he had earlier from the maximum of 30oz he can have:
* 30oz - 12oz = 18oz

Answer: 18oz
