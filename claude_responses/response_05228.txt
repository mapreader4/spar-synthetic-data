Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There are 42 apples in each crate.
2) 12 crates of apples were delivered to the factory.
3) To find the total number of apples delivered, we multiply the number of apples per crate (42) by the number of crates (12):
42 apples per crate x 12 crates = 504 total apples delivered.
4) 4 apples were rotten and had to be thrown away, so the number of good apples is 504 - 4 = 500 apples.
5) The boxes can fit 10 apples each.
6) To find the number of boxes, we divide the total number of good apples (500) by the number of apples per box (10):
500 apples / 10 apples per box = 50 boxes.

Answer: 50
