Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The original price of the laptop is $800.
2) The laptop has a 15% reduction in price.
3) To calculate the new price, we need to find 15% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.
4) 15% of $800 is 0.15 * $800 = $120.
5) Subtracting $120 from the original price of $800 gives us the new price of $680.

Answer: $680
