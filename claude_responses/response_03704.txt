Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* This year, the store sold 327 televisions on Black Friday
* Last year, they sold 50 fewer televisions, so 327 - 50 = 277 televisions
* The trend is that they sell 50 more televisions each year
* So, in one year, they will sell 327 + 50 = 377 televisions
* In two years, they will sell 377 + 50 = 427 televisions
* In three years, they will sell 427 + 50 = 477 televisions

Answer: 477 televisions
