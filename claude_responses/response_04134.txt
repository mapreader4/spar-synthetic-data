Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The triangle is a right-angle triangle, which means one of the angles is a 90-degree angle.
2) The base of the triangle is 4 inches, and the height is 3 inches.
3) To find the length of the hypotenuse, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angle triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
4) So, the length of the hypotenuse is given by the formula: hypotenuse^2 = base^2 + height^2
5) Plugging in the values, we get: hypotenuse^2 = 4^2 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25
6) Taking the square root of both sides, we get: hypotenuse = âˆš25 = 5 inches.
7) The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, so the perimeter is 4 inches + 3 inches + 5 inches = 12 inches.

Answer: 12 inches.
