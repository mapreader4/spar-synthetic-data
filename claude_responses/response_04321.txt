Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee.
2) Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee.
3) Arnold has 5 jellybeans.
4) Since Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee, we can say that Lee has 2 * 5 = 10 jellybeans.
5) If Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee, and Lee has 10 jellybeans, then Tino has 10 + 24 = 34 jellybeans.

Answer: 34
