Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janice had 3 dozens of pebbles
* 1 dozen = 12 pebbles
* So, Janice had 3 x 12 = 36 pebbles in total
* Each of her friends received 4 pebbles
* To find the number of friends, we need to divide the total number of pebbles (36) by the number of pebbles each friend received (4)
* 36 รท 4 = 9

Therefore, the number of friends who received pebbles is:
