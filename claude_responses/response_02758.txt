Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mohammad has 80 bags of chips in total
* One quarter of the bags of chips are Doritos
* To find the number of Doritos bags, we take one quarter of the total bags:
* 1/4 of 80 = 80 * 1/4 = 20 bags of Doritos
* Mohammad wants to split the 20 bags of Doritos into 4 equal piles
* To find the number of bags in each pile, we divide the total number of Doritos bags by 4:
* 20 bags / 4 piles = 5 bags per pile
