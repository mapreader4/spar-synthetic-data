Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adah practiced the cello for a total of 7.5 hours last week.
2) He practiced for 86 minutes on each of 2 days.
   * 86 minutes x 2 days = 172 minutes
3) To find the total minutes he practiced on the other days, we need to subtract the minutes he practiced on the 2 days from the total minutes he practiced last week.
   * 7.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 450 minutes
   * 450 minutes - 172 minutes = 278 minutes

Answer: 278 minutes
