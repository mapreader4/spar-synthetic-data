Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) John bought a vacuum cleaner for $250 and a dishwasher for $450.
2) The total cost of the vacuum cleaner and dishwasher is $250 + $450 = $700.
3) John has a $75 off coupon, which means he gets a $75 discount on the total cost.
4) To calculate the amount John spent, we take the total cost of $700 and subtract the $75 discount.
5) $700 - $75 = $625.

Answer: $625.
