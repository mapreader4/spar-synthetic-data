Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Amaya scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts. This means that if her Arts score is x, then her Maths score is x - 20.

2. Amaya got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music. This means that if her Music score is 70, then her Social Studies score is 70 + 10 = 80.

3. Amaya scored 1/10 less in Maths than her Arts score. This means that if her Arts score is x, then her Maths score is x - (x/10) = 9x/10.

Now, let's calculate the total marks Amaya scored in all the subjects:
* Arts: x
* Maths: 9x/10
* Social Studies: 80
* Music: 70

Total marks = x + 9x/10 + 80 + 70
= x + 0.9x + 80 + 70
= 1.9x + 150

To find the value of x, we can use the information that Amaya scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts:
* x - (9x/10) = 20
* 0.1x = 20
* x = 200

Therefore, the total number of marks Amaya scored in all the subjects is:
* 1.9(200) + 150 = 530

Answer: 530
