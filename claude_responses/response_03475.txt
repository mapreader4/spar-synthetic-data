Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kim has 12 nail polishes
* Heidi has 5 more nail polishes than Kim
* To find how many nail polishes Heidi has, we add 5 to Kim's 12 nail polishes:
    - Heidi's nail polishes = 12 + 5 = 17
* Karen has 4 fewer nail polishes than Kim
* To find how many nail polishes Karen has, we subtract 4 from Kim's 12 nail polishes:
    - Karen's nail polishes = 12 - 4 = 8
* To find the total number of nail polishes that Karen and Heidi have together, we add their individual totals:
    - Karen's nail polishes + Heidi's nail polishes = 8 + 17 = 25

Answer: 25
