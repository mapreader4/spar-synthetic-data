Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The ages of the three brothers are consecutive integers, meaning they are 3 numbers in a row, such as 10, 11, and 12.
2) The sum of their ages is 96.
3) Let's represent the ages as x, x+1, and x+2, where x is the age of the youngest brother.
4) The sum of their ages is 96, so we can write the equation:
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96
5) Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 3 = 96
6) Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:
3x = 93
7) Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 31
8) Therefore, the youngest brother is 31 years old.

Answer: 31
