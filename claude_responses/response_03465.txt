Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wyatt's mother gave him $74 to go to the store.
2) Wyatt bought 5 loaves of bread, and each loaf costs $5.
   * So the total cost of the bread is 5 x $5 = $25.
3) Wyatt also bought 4 cartons of orange juice, and each carton costs $2.
   * So the total cost of the orange juice is 4 x $2 = $8.
4) To find the total amount Wyatt spent, we add the cost of the bread and the orange juice:
   * $25 + $8 = $33.
5) To find how much money Wyatt has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original $74 that his mother gave him:
   * $74 - $33 = $41.
