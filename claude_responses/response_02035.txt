Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We are told that there are 14 more kittens than two times the number of puppies at the animal shelter.
2) We are also told that there are 32 puppies at the shelter.
3) So, two times the number of puppies is 2 * 32 = 64.
4) We know that the number of kittens is 14 more than two times the number of puppies, so the number of kittens is 64 + 14 = 78.

Answer: 78
