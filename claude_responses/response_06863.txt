Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Each tree the lumberjack chops down produces 4 logs.
2) Each log is then chopped into 5 pieces of firewood.
3) So, each tree produces 4 logs x 5 pieces of firewood per log = 20 pieces of firewood.
4) The lumberjack has chopped 500 pieces of firewood.
5) To find the number of trees he chopped down, we need to divide the total pieces of firewood (500) by the number of pieces of firewood per tree (20).
6) 500 pieces of firewood / 20 pieces of firewood per tree = 25 trees.

Answer: 25
