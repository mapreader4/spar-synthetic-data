Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farm has 2 fields growing corn
* One field has 13 full rows of corn cobs
* The other field has 16 full rows of corn cobs
* Each row contains 4 corn cobs

To find the total number of corn cobs grown, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of corn cobs in the first field:
   * 13 rows x 4 cobs per row = 52 corn cobs
2. Calculate the number of corn cobs in the second field:
   * 16 rows x 4 cobs per row = 64 corn cobs
3. Add the number of corn cobs from both fields:
   * 52 + 64 = 116 corn cobs

Answer: 116
