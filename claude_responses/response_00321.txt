Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred.
2) Fred's salary five months ago was $1000.
3) Therefore, Mike's salary five months ago was 10 times $1000, which is $10,000.
4) Mike's salary has now increased by 40 percent.
5) To calculate the 40 percent increase, we take 40% of $10,000, which is $4,000.
6) So Mike's new salary is $10,000 + $4,000 = $14,000.

Answer: $14,000
