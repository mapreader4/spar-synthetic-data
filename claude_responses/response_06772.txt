Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The group spent a total of $94 on fruit juice
* Some ordered mango juice at $5 per glass
* Others ordered pineapple juice at $6 per glass
* $54 was spent on pineapple juice

First, let's find out how much was spent on pineapple juice:
* $54 was spent on pineapple juice
* Since pineapple juice costs $6 per glass, we can divide $54 by $6 to find the number of pineapple juice glasses ordered:
* $54 / $6 = 9 pineapple juice glasses

Now, let's find the total number of glasses ordered:
* The total amount spent was $94
* We know that $54 was spent on pineapple juice
* So the remaining amount, $94 - $54 = $40, was spent on mango juice
* Since mango juice costs $5 per glass, we can divide $40 by $5 to find the number of mango juice glasses ordered:
* $40 / $5 = 8 mango juice glasses
* Therefore, the total number of glasses ordered is 9 (pineapple) + 8 (mango) = 17 glasses

Answer: 17 people were in the group.
