Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jim has 200g of flour in the cupboard, 100g of flour on the kitchen counter, and 100g in the pantry.
2) In total, Jim has 200g + 100g + 100g = 400g of flour.
3) Each loaf of bread requires 200g of flour.
4) To find the number of loaves Jim can bake, we divide the total amount of flour by the amount required per loaf:
400g / 200g per loaf = 2 loaves.
