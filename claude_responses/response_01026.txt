Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Mr. Martinez is 2 feet taller than his daughter, Chiquita.
2) We also know that Chiquita is 5 feet tall.
3) To find Mr. Martinez's height, we add 2 feet to Chiquita's height:
   Chiquita's height: 5 feet
   Mr. Martinez's height: 5 feet + 2 feet = 7 feet
4) To find their combined height, we add Chiquita's height and Mr. Martinez's height:
   Chiquita's height: 5 feet
   Mr. Martinez's height: 7 feet
   Combined height: 5 feet + 7 feet = 12 feet

Answer: 12
