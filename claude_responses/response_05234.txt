Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Milena is 7 years old.
2) Milena's grandmother is 9 times older than her, so the grandmother's age is 7 x 9 = 63 years old.
3) Milena's grandfather is two years older than her grandmother, so the grandfather's age is 63 + 2 = 65 years old.
4) The age difference between Milena and her grandfather is 65 - 7 = 58 years.

Answer: 58
