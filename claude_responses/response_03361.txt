Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Agnes is currently 25 years old
* Jane is currently 6 years old
* We want to find out how many years from now Agnes will be twice as old as Jane

To do this, we need to find out how old Agnes and Jane will be in the future when Agnes is twice as old as Jane.

Let's call the number of years from now "x".

* In x years, Agnes will be 25 + x years old
* In x years, Jane will be 6 + x years old

We want Agnes to be twice as old as Jane, so:
* (25 + x) = 2 * (6 + x)
* 25 + x = 12 + 2x
* 13 = x
* So in 13 years, Agnes will be twice as old as Jane.

Answer: 13
