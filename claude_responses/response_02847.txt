Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* GiGi cut each mushroom into 4 pieces
* Kenny sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza
* Karla sprinkled 42 mushroom pieces on her pizza
* There were 8 pieces of mushrooms remaining on the cutting board

To find the total number of mushrooms GiGi cut up, we need to add up the number of mushroom pieces used by Kenny and Karla, as well as the remaining 8 pieces.

Kenny used 38 mushroom pieces, and Karla used 42 mushroom pieces. So the total number of mushroom pieces used is:
* 38 + 42 = 80 mushroom pieces

There were also 8 remaining pieces on the cutting board.
* 80 + 8 = 88 mushroom pieces

Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4 to find the original number of mushrooms:
* 88 / 4 = 22 mushrooms

Answer: 22
