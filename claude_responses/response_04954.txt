Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jangshe spent a total of $610 on 7 pieces of clothing
* One piece was $49 and another piece was $81
* The remaining 5 pieces were all the same price

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two pieces that were $49 and $81:
* $49 + $81 = $130

Now, we can subtract the cost of those two pieces from the total amount spent ($610) to get the total cost of the remaining 5 pieces:
* $610 - $130 = $480

Since the remaining 5 pieces were all the same price, we can divide the total cost of those pieces ($480) by the number of pieces (5) to get the price of one of the other pieces:
* $480 / 5 = $96

Answer: $96
