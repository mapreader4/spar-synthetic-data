Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of apples was $1.6 per pound.
2) The price was raised by 25%. To calculate the new price, we take the original price and add 25% of the original price:
   * 25% of $1.6 = 0.4
   * New price = $1.6 + $0.4 = $2 per pound
3) The family has 4 members, and each person wants to buy 2 pounds of apples.
4) To calculate the total cost, we multiply the new price per pound ($2) by the total number of pounds (4 people x 2 pounds = 8 pounds):
   * 8 pounds x $2 per pound = $16

Answer: $16
