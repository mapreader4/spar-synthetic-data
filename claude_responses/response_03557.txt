Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The pool holds 2000 L of water
* Each time someone jumps in, 400 ml of water splashes out and evaporates
* We need to find how many times people can jump in before the pool gets below 80% full

First, let's convert the pool capacity to milliliters:
* 2000 L = 2,000,000 ml

Now, let's calculate 80% of the pool capacity:
* 80% of 2,000,000 ml = 0.8 * 2,000,000 ml = 1,600,000 ml

So, the pool needs to be refilled when it gets below 1,600,000 ml.

Now, let's calculate how many times people can jump in before the pool gets below 1,600,000 ml:
* Each jump causes 400 ml of water to be lost
* To get below 1,600,000 ml, the pool needs to lose 2,000,000 ml - 1,600,000 ml = 400,000 ml
* 400,000 ml / 400 ml per jump = 1,000 jumps

Answer: 1,000
