Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Hilary bought 3 samosas at $2 each, so the cost of the samosas is:
   3 x $2 = $6

2. Hilary bought 4 orders of pakoras at $3 each, so the cost of the pakoras is:
   4 x $3 = $12

3. Hilary bought 1 mango lassi for $2

4. The total cost of the food and drink is:
   $6 + $12 + $2 = $20

5. Hilary left a 25% tip, which is calculated as:
   $20 x 0.25 = $5

6. The total cost of the meal, including the tip, is:
   $20 + $5 = $25

Therefore, the total cost of the meal, with tax, is $25.

Answer: 25
