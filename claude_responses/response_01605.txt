Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 92 students altogether.
2) 20 of them ride the school bus home together.
3) The remaining students are either riding their bikes or walking home.
4) 5/8 of the remaining students ride their bikes home.
5) To calculate the number of students riding their bikes, we first need to find the number of students remaining after the 20 bus riders are subtracted:
92 - 20 = 72 students remaining
6) 5/8 of 72 is:
5/8 * 72 = 45 students riding their bikes
7) The remaining students are walking home.
8) To find the number of students walking home, we subtract the bus riders and bike riders from the total:
92 - 20 - 45 = 27 students walking home

Answer: 27
