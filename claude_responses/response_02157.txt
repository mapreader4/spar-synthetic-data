Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rona is 8 years old.
2) Rachel is twice as old as Rona, so Rachel's age is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.
3) Collete's age is half the age of Rona's, so Collete's age is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.
4) The difference between the age of Collete and Rachel is 16 - 4 = 12 years.

Answer: 12
