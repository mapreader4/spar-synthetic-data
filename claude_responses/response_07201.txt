Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 200 people visit the museum in one day
* Half of the visitors are residents of New York City
* 30% of the NYC residents are college students
* The cost of a college student ticket is $4

First, we need to find out how many NYC residents visited the museum:
* 50% of 200 people = 100 NYC residents

Next, we need to find out how many of those NYC residents are college students:
* 30% of 100 people = 30 college students

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money the museum gets from the college students who are NYC residents:
* 30 college students x $4 per ticket = $120

Answer: $120
