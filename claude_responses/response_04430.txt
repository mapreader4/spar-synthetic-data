Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barbara wants to save up for a wristwatch that costs $100
* Her parents give her an allowance of $5 a week
* After 10 weeks, she has only saved up $20
* This means she has spent $30 of her allowance on other things (like ice cream)
* Now, she wants to save the remaining $80 for the watch
* She gets $5 per week from her allowance
* So, to save the remaining $80, she needs to save for:
    * $80 / $5 per week = 16 more weeks

Answer: 16 more weeks
