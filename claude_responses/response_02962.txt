Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hayden's hourly wage is $15
* He drove for 8 hours today
* So his base pay for the day is 8 hours x $15/hour = $120
* He gets $5 for each ride he gives
* He gave rides to 3 groups today
* So he gets an additional 3 x $5 = $15 for the rides
* He had to put 17 gallons of gas in the limo at $3 per gallon
* So the gas reimbursement is 17 gallons x $3/gallon = $51
* He also got 2 good reviews, which gives him a $20 bonus for each review
* So the bonus is 2 x $20 = $40

Adding up all the components:
Base pay: $120
Ride pay: $15
Gas reimbursement: $51
Bonus: $40
Total owed: $120 + $15 + $51 + $40 = $226

Answer: $226
