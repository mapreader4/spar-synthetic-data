Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John books 3 nights at a hotel room.
2) The cost per night is $250.
3) The total cost for the 3 nights would be:
   3 nights x $250 per night = $750
4) John has a $100 discount.
5) To calculate the final amount John pays, we take the total cost of $750 and subtract the $100 discount:
   $750 - $100 = $650
Answer: $650
