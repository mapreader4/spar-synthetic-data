Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jar A has 28 marbles.
2) Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A, so Jar B has 28 + 12 = 40 marbles.
3) Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B, so Jar C has 2 * 40 = 80 marbles.
4) To find the total number of marbles, we add the number of marbles in each jar:
28 + 40 + 80 = 148 marbles.

Answer: 148
