Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Amanda started with 7 candy bars.
2) She gave 3 of them to her sister.
3) So, she had 7 - 3 = 4 candy bars left.
4) The next day, Amanda won some prize money and bought 30 more candy bars.
5) So, now she has 4 + 30 = 34 candy bars.
6) She then gave her sister 4 times as many candy bars as she did the first time, which is 4 x 3 = 12 candy bars.
7) So, she has 34 - 12 = 22 candy bars left for herself.
