Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The total number of chips is 100.
2) The ratio of chips between Ian and Lyle is 4:6.
3) This means that Ian gets 4 parts and Lyle gets 6 parts.
4) The total number of parts is 4 + 6 = 10.
5) Lyle's share is 6 parts out of the total 10 parts.
6) To find the percentage of chips Lyle has, we need to divide Lyle's share by the total and multiply by 100.
7) 6/10 * 100 = 60%

Answer: 60
