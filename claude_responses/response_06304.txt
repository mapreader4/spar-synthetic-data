Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joshua collected 80 rocks.
2) Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua, so Jose collected 80 - 14 = 66 rocks.
3) Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose, so Albert collected 66 + 20 = 86 rocks.
4) To find how many more rocks Albert collected than Joshua, we subtract Joshua's rocks from Albert's rocks:
86 - 80 = 6.

Answer: 6
