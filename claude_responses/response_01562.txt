Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Each candy necklace is made up of 10 pieces of candy
* Each block of candy produces 30 pieces of candy
* Jan breaks down 3 blocks of candy

First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy that Jan has:
* 3 blocks of candy x 30 pieces per block = 90 pieces of candy

Now, we need to figure out how many candy necklaces can be made with 90 pieces of candy:
* 90 pieces of candy / 10 pieces per necklace = 9 candy necklaces

Since Jan is making a necklace for herself, the remaining 8 necklaces are for her friends.

Answer: 8
