Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The final score was 37-23, with the Seattle Seahawks winning
* A touchdown is worth 7 points
* A field goal is worth 3 points
* The Seattle Seahawks scored 3 field goals

To find the number of touchdowns the Seattle Seahawks scored, we need to subtract the points from the field goals from the total points scored by the Seattle Seahawks.

The total points scored by the Seattle Seahawks is 37.
The points from the 3 field goals is 3 x 3 = 9 points.
So the remaining points must have come from touchdowns.

37 total points - 9 points from field goals = 28 points from touchdowns.
Since each touchdown is worth 7 points, we can divide the remaining 28 points by 7 to find the number of touchdowns.

28 points / 7 points per touchdown = 4 touchdowns.
