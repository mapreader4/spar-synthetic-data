Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bag has 80 pistachios total
* 95% of the pistachios have shells
* To find the number of pistachios with shells, we take 95% of 80:
    * 95% of 80 = 0.95 * 80 = 76 pistachios have shells
* 75% of the pistachios with shells have opened shells
* To find the number of pistachios with opened shells, we take 75% of the 76 pistachios with shells:
    * 75% of 76 = 0.75 * 76 = 57 pistachios have opened shells

Answer: 57
