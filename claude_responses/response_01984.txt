Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jacob is trying to eat less than 1800 calories a day
* For breakfast, he ate 400 calories
* For lunch, he ate 900 calories
* For dinner, he ate 1100 calories
* To find the total calories he ate, we add up the calories from each meal:
* 400 + 900 + 1100 = 2400 calories
* Now, to find how many more calories he ate than he planned, we subtract the target of 1800 calories from the total calories he ate:
* 2400 - 1800 = 600 calories

Answer: 600
