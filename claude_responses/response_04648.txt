Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vince earns $18 per head
* He serves 80 customers a month
* His monthly expenses are $280 for rent and electricity
* 20% of his earnings are allocated for recreation and relaxation

First, let's calculate his total earnings for the month:
* Total earnings = $18 per head x 80 customers = $1,440

Next, let's calculate the amount allocated for recreation and relaxation:
* Recreation and relaxation = 20% of $1,440 = 0.20 x $1,440 = $288

Now, let's calculate his total expenses:
* Total expenses = $280 (rent and electricity) + $288 (recreation and relaxation) = $568

Finally, to calculate the amount he saves, we take his total earnings and subtract his total expenses:
* Amount saved = $1,440 - $568 = $872

Answer: $872
