Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* June had a total of 76 cat stickers in her collection
* Bonnie had a total of 63 cat stickers in her collection
* For their birthday, their grandparents gave them 25 cat stickers each

To find the total number of combined stickers they had, we need to:
1. Add the number of stickers June and Bonnie had before their birthday
2. Add the number of stickers they each received for their birthday

Step 1:
* June had 76 stickers
* Bonnie had 63 stickers
* Total before birthday = 76 + 63 = 139 stickers

Step 2:
* Each of them received 25 stickers for their birthday
* Total additional stickers = 25 + 25 = 50 stickers

Now we add the total before their birthday and the additional stickers they received:
* 139 + 50 = 189 stickers

Answer: 189
