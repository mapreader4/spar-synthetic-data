Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Each bedroom takes 4 hours to renovate.
2. There are 3 bedrooms, so the total time for the bedrooms is:
   3 bedrooms x 4 hours per bedroom = 12 hours

3. The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom, so:
   4 hours per bedroom + 50% = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours

4. The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined, so:
   Time for bedrooms + time for kitchen = 12 hours + 6 hours = 18 hours
   Time for living room = 2 x 18 hours = 36 hours

5. To find the total time, we add up the time for the bedrooms, kitchen, and living room:
   12 hours + 6 hours + 36 hours = 54 hours

Answer: 54 hours
