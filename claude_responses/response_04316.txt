Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cloud 9 Diving Company has taken individual bookings worth $12,000.
2) They have also taken group bookings worth $16,000.
3) Some people have cancelled at the last minute, and $1,600 has had to be returned to them.
4) To calculate the total money the company has taken, we need to add the individual bookings and group bookings, and then subtract the amount that had to be returned.
5) $12,000 (individual bookings) + $16,000 (group bookings) = $28,000
6) $28,000 - $1,600 (amount returned) = $26,400

Answer: $26,400
