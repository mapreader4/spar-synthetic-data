Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The original flock size is 100 ducks
* Every year, 20 ducks are killed, but 30 are born
* So, the net change in the flock size each year is an increase of 10 ducks (30 born - 20 killed)
* After 5 years, the flock size has increased by 5 * 10 = 50 ducks
* So, the flock size after 5 years is 100 + 50 = 150 ducks
* The flock then joins with another flock of 150 ducks
* Therefore, the combined flock size is 150 + 150 = 300 ducks

Answer: 300
