Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chance boarded a plane from London to New York at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday.
* He arrived in New York 18 hours later.
* This means he arrived in New York at 12:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
* He then took another plane from New York to Cape Town, and arrived in Cape Town at 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
* To calculate the number of hours his flight took from New York to Cape Town, we need to find the difference between his arrival time in Cape Town (10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday) and his arrival time in New York (12:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday).
* The difference between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. is 10 hours.
* Therefore, the flight from New York to Cape Town took 10 hours.
