Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jamie had a cup of milk at lunch, which is 8 ounces.
* She also had a pint of grape juice at recess, which is 16 ounces.
* So the total amount of liquid she has consumed is 8 ounces (milk) + 16 ounces (grape juice) = 24 ounces.
* Jamie can only have up to 32 ounces of liquid before she has to use the bathroom.
* Therefore, the amount of water she can drink from her water bottle during the test is 32 ounces - 24 ounces = 8 ounces.

Answer: 8 ounces.
