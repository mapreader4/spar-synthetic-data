Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Annalise was sent to buy 10 boxes of Kleenex Ultra Soft Facial Tissues
* Each box has 20 packs of tissues
* Each pack contains 100 tissues
* Each tissue is sold at 5 cents

To calculate the total amount of money Annalise spent, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of tissues in 10 boxes:
   * 10 boxes x 20 packs per box x 100 tissues per pack = 20,000 tissues
2. Calculate the total cost of the 20,000 tissues:
   * 20,000 tissues x $0.05 per tissue = $1,000

Therefore, the total amount of money Annalise spent to buy the ten boxes is:

Answer: $1,000
