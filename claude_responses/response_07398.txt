Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The boy squirrel gathers 6 walnuts and carries them to his burrow, which already had 12 walnuts.
2) However, the boy squirrel drops 1 walnut on the way, so the total number of walnuts in the burrow is 6 + 12 - 1 = 17.
3) The girl squirrel then brings 5 more walnuts to the burrow.
4) But the girl squirrel also eats 2 walnuts.
5) So the total number of walnuts left in the burrow is 17 + 5 - 2 = 20.

Answer: 20
