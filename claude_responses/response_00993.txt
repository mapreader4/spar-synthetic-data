Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Rick started with 130 cards
* He decided to keep 15 cards for himself
* He gave 12 cards each to 8 friends
* The remaining cards were given equally to his 2 sisters, and each sister got 3 cards

First, let's calculate how many cards Rick gave to his 8 friends:
* 8 friends x 12 cards each = 96 cards

Now, let's calculate the remaining cards after giving 15 to himself and 96 to his friends:
* 130 cards - 15 cards - 96 cards = 19 cards

Since each of his 2 sisters got 3 cards, that means:
* 2 sisters x 3 cards each = 6 cards

The remaining cards were given to Miguel, so:
* 19 cards - 6 cards = 13 cards

Answer: 13 cards
