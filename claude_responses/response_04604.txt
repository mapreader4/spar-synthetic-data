Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that Mr. Gordon has taken 2/5 times more girls than boys on the trip.
2) The total number of boys on the trip is 50.
3) To find the number of girls, we can use the ratio of girls to boys, which is 2/5 more girls than boys.
4) The number of girls = 50 + (2/5 * 50) = 50 + 20 = 70.
5) The total number of students on the bus is the sum of the boys and girls, which is 50 + 70 = 120.
6) In addition to the students, there is a driver and an assistant, so the total number of people on the bus is 120 + 2 = 122.
7) Finally, the teacher also drives together with the students on the bus, so the total number of people on the bus is 122 + 1 = 123.

Answer: 123
