Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 18 contestants in total
* One-third of the contestants are female
* The remaining contestants are male

To find the number of male contestants, we first need to find the number of female contestants.

Since one-third of the contestants are female, we can calculate the number of female contestants as:
* 1/3 of 18 = 6 female contestants

Now, to find the number of male contestants, we subtract the number of female contestants from the total number of contestants:
* 18 total contestants - 6 female contestants = 12 male contestants

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 12
