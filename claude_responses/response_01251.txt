Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Josh bought 9 films, and each film cost $5. So the total cost of the films is:
9 films x $5 per film = $45

2) Josh bought 4 books, and each book cost $4. So the total cost of the books is:
4 books x $4 per book = $16

3) Josh bought 6 CDs, and each CD cost $3. So the total cost of the CDs is:
6 CDs x $3 per CD = $18

4) To calculate the total amount Josh spent, we add up the costs of the films, books, and CDs:
$45 + $16 + $18 = $79

Answer: 79
