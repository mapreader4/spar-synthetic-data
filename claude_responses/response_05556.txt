Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Delores buys a computer for $400 and a printer for $40.
2) The total cost of the computer and printer is $400 + $40 = $440.
3) Delores has $10 left after making the purchases.
4) To find how much money Delores had at first, we need to add the $10 she has left to the $440 she spent on the computer and printer.
5) $10 + $440 = $450.

Answer: $450
