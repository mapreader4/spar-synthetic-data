Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bar of chocolate has 60 pieces total.
* Michael takes half of the bar, which is 60 / 2 = 30 pieces.
* That leaves 60 - 30 = 30 pieces remaining.
* Paige takes half of the remaining 30 pieces, which is 30 / 2 = 15 pieces.
* That leaves 30 - 15 = 15 pieces remaining.
* Mandy is left with the remaining 15 pieces.

Answer: 15
