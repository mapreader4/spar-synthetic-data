Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The store sold 19 bikes in the morning
* For each of those 19 bikes, the customer received 2 bike clamps for free
* So for the morning sales, the store gave away 19 * 2 = 38 bike clamps
* The store sold 27 bikes in the afternoon
* For each of those 27 bikes, the customer received 2 bike clamps for free
* So for the afternoon sales, the store gave away 27 * 2 = 54 bike clamps
* To find the total number of bike clamps given away, we add the morning and afternoon totals:
* 38 + 54 = 92 bike clamps

Answer: 92
