Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The monitor is 21 inches by 12 inches.
2) There are 100 dots per inch.
3) To calculate the total number of pixels, we need to multiply the number of dots in the horizontal direction by the number of dots in the vertical direction.
4) The number of dots in the horizontal direction is 21 inches * 100 dots/inch = 2,100 dots.
5) The number of dots in the vertical direction is 12 inches * 100 dots/inch = 1,200 dots.
6) The total number of pixels is 2,100 dots * 1,200 dots = 2,520,000 pixels.

Answer: 2,520,000
