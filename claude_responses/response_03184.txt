Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) You bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns.
2) Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies.
3) Rick bought 30 guppies.

First, let's find out how many clowns Tim bought:
* Rick bought 30 guppies
* Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies
* So, Tim bought 2 * 30 = 60 clowns

Now, let's find out how many tetras you bought:
* You bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns
* Tim bought 60 clowns
* So, you bought 4 * 60 = 240 tetras

Finally, let's add up the total number of animals bought:
* Rick bought 30 guppies
* Tim bought 60 clowns
* You bought 240 tetras
* Total animals bought = 30 + 60 + 240 = 330

Answer: 330
