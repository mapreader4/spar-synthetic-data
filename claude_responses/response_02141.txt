Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry mows 8 acres of lawn each week
* He mows ¾ of it with a riding mower
* The riding mower can cut 2 acres per hour
* He mows the remaining ¼ with a push mower
* The push mower can cut 1 acre per hour

First, let's calculate how much of the 8 acres he mows with the riding mower:
* ¾ of 8 acres = 6 acres

Now, let's calculate how long it takes him to mow the 6 acres with the riding mower:
* 6 acres / 2 acres per hour = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate how much of the 8 acres he mows with the push mower:
* ¼ of 8 acres = 2 acres

Now, let's calculate how long it takes him to mow the 2 acres with the push mower:
* 2 acres / 1 acre per hour = 2 hours

Finally, to get the total time Jerry spends mowing each week, we add the time for the riding mower and the push mower:
* 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours

Answer: 5 hours
