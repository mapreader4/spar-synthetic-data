Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We have 30 apple trees, and each apple tree gives 150 kg of apples.
2. To find the total mass of apples harvested, we multiply the number of apple trees (30) by the amount of apples each tree gives (150 kg):
   30 apple trees x 150 kg per tree = 4,500 kg of apples

3. We have 45 peach trees, and each peach tree produces an average of 65 kg of fruit.
4. To find the total mass of peaches harvested, we multiply the number of peach trees (45) by the average amount of fruit each tree produces (65 kg):
   45 peach trees x 65 kg per tree = 2,925 kg of peaches

5. To find the total mass of fruit harvested in the orchard, we add the total mass of apples (4,500 kg) and the total mass of peaches (2,925 kg):
   4,500 kg + 2,925 kg = 7,425 kg

Answer: 7,425
