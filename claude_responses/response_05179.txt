Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The water tank can hold 200 gallons.
2) The tank weighs 80 pounds when empty.
3) The tank is filled to 80% of its capacity during the rainstorm.
4) A gallon of water weighs 8 pounds.

To calculate the weight of the tank when it is 80% full:
* 80% of 200 gallons = 0.8 * 200 = 160 gallons
* 160 gallons * 8 pounds/gallon = 1,280 pounds of water
* The empty tank weighs 80 pounds
* Therefore, the total weight of the tank when it is 80% full is 80 pounds + 1,280 pounds = 1,360 pounds

Answer: 1,360 pounds
