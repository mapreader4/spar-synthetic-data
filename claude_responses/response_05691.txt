Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Arthur ordered:
  - Appetizer: $8
  - Entrée (ribeye steak): $20
  - 2 glasses of wine: $3 each, so $6 total
  - Dessert (cheesecake): $6
* He used a voucher for 50% off the entrée, so the discounted price of the entrée was $10 (half of $20).
* The total cost of the meal before tip was:
  - Appetizer: $8
  - Discounted Entrée: $10
  - Wine: $6
  - Dessert: $6
  - Total: $8 + $10 + $6 + $6 = $30
* He tipped 20% of the full cost of the meal, which would have been $40 (without the discount). 20% of $40 is $8.
* Therefore, the total amount Arthur spent on dinner, including the tip, is:
Answer: $30 + $8 = $38
