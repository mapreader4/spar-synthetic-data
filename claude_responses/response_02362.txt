Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John releases 3 videos per day
* 2 of the videos are 2 minutes long
* 1 of the videos is 6 times as long as the 2-minute videos
* We want to find the total minutes of video released per week

First, let's calculate the length of the longer video:
* The longer video is 6 times as long as the 2-minute videos
* So the longer video is 6 x 2 = 12 minutes long

Now, let's calculate the total minutes of video released per day:
* 2 videos at 2 minutes each = 4 minutes
* 1 video at 12 minutes = 12 minutes
* Total minutes per day = 4 + 12 = 16 minutes

Finally, let's calculate the total minutes of video released per week:
* 16 minutes per day x 7 days per week = 112 minutes per week

Answer: 112
