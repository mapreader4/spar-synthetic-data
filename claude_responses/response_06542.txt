Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The house has 3 bedrooms.
2) There are twice as many other rooms as bedrooms, so there are 2 x 3 = 6 other rooms.
3) In total, there are 3 bedrooms + 6 other rooms = 9 rooms.
4) Each room takes 2 gallons of paint.
5) Therefore, the total amount of paint needed is 9 rooms x 2 gallons per room = 18 gallons.
6) Color paint comes in 1-gallon cans, so Bill will need to buy 18 cans of color paint.
7) White paint comes in 3-gallon cans, so Bill will need to buy 18 gallons / 3 gallons per can = 6 cans of white paint.
8) In total, Bill will need 18 cans of color paint and 6 cans of white paint.

Answer: 24 cans of paint.
