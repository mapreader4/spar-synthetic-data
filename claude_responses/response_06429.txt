Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Arnold's collagen powder has 18 grams of protein for every 2 scoops
* This means that 1 scoop of collagen powder has 18 / 2 = 9 grams of protein
* Arnold's protein powder has 21 grams of protein per scoop
* Arnold is having 1 scoop of collagen powder and 1 scoop of protein powder
* The collagen powder provides 9 grams of protein
* The protein powder provides 21 grams of protein
* Arnold is also having a steak that has 56 grams of protein
* To calculate the total grams of protein consumed:
* Collagen powder: 9 grams
* Protein powder: 21 grams
* Steak: 56 grams
* Total grams of protein consumed: 9 + 21 + 56 = 86 grams

Answer: 86 grams
