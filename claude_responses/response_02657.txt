Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The box holds 2 dozen doughnuts, which means it holds 2 x 12 = 24 doughnuts.
2) The family ate 8 doughnuts.
3) To find the number of doughnuts left, we need to subtract the number of doughnuts eaten from the total number of doughnuts in the box.
4) 24 doughnuts - 8 doughnuts = 16 doughnuts.

Answer: 16
