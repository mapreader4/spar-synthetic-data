Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Samuel swept the porch and cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from it.
2) This means that one-tenth of the original dust particles remained on the porch after he swept.
3) After Samuel walked across the porch, there were 331 dust particles on the porch.
4) Of those 331 dust particles, 223 were left by his shoes.
5) So the number of dust particles that were on the porch before Samuel walked across it was 331 - 223 = 108.
6) Since one-tenth of the original dust particles remained on the porch after he swept, we can calculate the original number of dust particles as follows:
   * 108 is one-tenth of the original number
   * So the original number of dust particles was 108 * 10 = 1080.

Answer: 1080
