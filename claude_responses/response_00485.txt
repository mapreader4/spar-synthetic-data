Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lance works 35 hours per week
* He spreads his work equally over 5 workdays
* So, he works 35 hours / 5 days = 7 hours per workday
* Lance earns $9 per hour
* To calculate his earnings per workday, we multiply his hours per workday (7 hours) by his hourly rate ($9 per hour)
* 7 hours per workday x $9 per hour = $63 per workday

Answer: $63
