Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The pool is rectangular, with dimensions of 10 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep.
2) To calculate the volume of the pool, we multiply the length, width, and depth:
   Volume = 10 feet x 8 feet x 6 feet = 480 cubic feet
3) Gary needs to buy 1 quart of chlorine for every 120 cubic feet of water in the pool.
4) To calculate the number of quarts of chlorine needed, we divide the total volume of the pool by 120:
   Number of quarts = 480 cubic feet / 120 cubic feet per quart = 4 quarts
5) Chlorine costs $3 per quart.
6) To calculate the total cost, we multiply the number of quarts by the cost per quart:
   Total cost = 4 quarts x $3 per quart = $12

Answer: $12
