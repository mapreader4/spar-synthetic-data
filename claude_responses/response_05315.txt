Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sam went for a morning run
* In the afternoon, he went grocery shopping and walked twice the distance through the store as he had run that morning
* In the evening, he went on a bike ride with his family and biked for 12 miles
* In total, he went 18 miles that day

We know that the distance he walked in the grocery store was twice the distance of his morning run. Let's call the distance of his morning run 'x'.

So, the distance he walked in the grocery store was 2x.

We also know that the total distance he traveled that day was 18 miles. This includes:
* His morning run (x miles)
* His grocery store walk (2x miles)
* His evening bike ride (12 miles)

Therefore, the total distance is:
x + 2x + 12 = 18

Solving for x:
3x + 12 = 18
3x = 6
x = 2

Therefore, the distance of Sam's morning run was 2 miles.
