Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total bill was $140.
2) The sales tax in the city is 10%.
3) The NY Striploin cost $80.
4) The glass of wine cost $10.

To calculate the gratuities charged:
1) First, we need to calculate the total before tax:
   - Total before tax = $140 / 1.1 = $127.27
2) Next, we need to calculate the cost of the food and drink items:
   - NY Striploin: $80
   - Glass of wine: $10
   - Total cost of food and drink: $80 + $10 = $90
3) The gratuities charged would be the difference between the total before tax and the cost of the food and drink:
   - Gratuities charged = $127.27 - $90 = $37.27

Answer: $37
