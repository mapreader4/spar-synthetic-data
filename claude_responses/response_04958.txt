Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The flower shop sells 20 bouquets in total today
* 10 of these bouquets are rose bouquets, and each rose bouquet contains 12 roses
* The remaining 10 bouquets are daisy bouquets, and each daisy bouquet contains an equal amount of daisies
* The total number of flowers sold is 190

First, let's calculate the number of roses sold:
* 10 rose bouquets x 12 roses per bouquet = 120 roses

Now, we can calculate the number of daisies sold:
* Total flowers sold = 190
* Roses sold = 120
* Daisies sold = 190 - 120 = 70

Since there are 10 daisy bouquets, each daisy bouquet must contain 7 daisies (70 daisies / 10 bouquets = 7 daisies per bouquet).
