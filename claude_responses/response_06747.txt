Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carson runs a carpool for 5 of his friends
* The total commute is 21 miles one way
* Gas costs $2.50 per gallon
* Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon
* They commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per month:
* 21 miles one way x 2 (round trip) = 42 miles per day
* 42 miles per day x 5 days per week = 210 miles per week
* 210 miles per week x 4 weeks per month = 840 miles per month

Next, let's calculate the amount of gas needed per month:
* 840 miles per month / 30 miles per gallon = 28 gallons of gas per month

Now, let's calculate the total cost of gas per month:
* 28 gallons of gas per month x $2.50 per gallon = $70 per month

Finally, to calculate how much each person pays toward gas monthly:
* $70 per month / 6 people (Carson and his 5 friends) = $11.67 per person per month
