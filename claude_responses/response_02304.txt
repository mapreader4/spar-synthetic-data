Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Amy's grandfather gave her $100 for her birthday
* Amy bought 3 dolls
* Each doll cost $1

To calculate the amount of money Amy has left, we need to subtract the total cost of the dolls from the amount of money she received from her grandfather.

The total cost of the 3 dolls is:
* 3 dolls x $1 per doll = $3

Now, we subtract the total cost of the dolls from the $100 she received:
* $100 - $3 = $97

Therefore, the amount of money Amy has left is:
Answer: 97
