Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store.
2) You walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris, which means it would take you 1 hour to walk the same distance that Mr. Harris walked in 2 hours.
3) Your destination is 3 times further away than the store Mr. Harris walked to.
4) Since your destination is 3 times further away, it will take you 3 times longer to get there.
5) If it takes you 1 hour to walk the same distance as Mr. Harris, then it will take you 3 hours to walk 3 times that distance.

Answer: 3 hours
