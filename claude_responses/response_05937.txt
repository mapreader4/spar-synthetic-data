Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beth has 72 marbles in total.
2) The marbles are in three colors, and each color has the same amount.
3) So, if we divide 72 by 3, we get the number of marbles of each color: 72 / 3 = 24 marbles of each color.
4) Beth loses 5 red marbles, so she has 24 - 5 = 19 red marbles left.
5) She loses twice as many blue marbles as red marbles, which is 2 * 5 = 10 blue marbles. So, she has 24 - 10 = 14 blue marbles left.
6) She loses three times as many yellow marbles as red marbles, which is 3 * 5 = 15 yellow marbles. So, she has 24 - 15 = 9 yellow marbles left.
7) Adding up the remaining marbles: 19 red + 14 blue + 9 yellow = 42 marbles.

Answer: 42
