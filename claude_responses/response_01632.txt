Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The rectangle is 7 inches wide.
2) The rectangle is 4 times as long as it is wide.
3) To find the length of the rectangle, we multiply the width by 4:
   * Width = 7 inches
   * Length = 7 inches x 4 = 28 inches
4) To find the area of the rectangle, we multiply the length by the width:
   * Area = Length x Width
   * Area = 28 inches x 7 inches = 196 square inches

Answer: 196
