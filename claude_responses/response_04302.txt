Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The restaurant makes 40 more pizzas than hot dogs every day
* The restaurant makes 60 hot dogs every day
* To find the number of pizzas made every day, we can add 40 to the number of hot dogs made:
    - Number of pizzas made per day = 60 + 40 = 100
* June has 30 days
* To find the total number of pizzas and hot dogs made in June, we multiply the daily amounts by 30:
    - Total pizzas made in June = 100 pizzas per day x 30 days = 3,000 pizzas
    - Total hot dogs made in June = 60 hot dogs per day x 30 days = 1,800 hot dogs

Answer: The restaurant will make 3,000 pizzas and 1,800 hot dogs in June.
