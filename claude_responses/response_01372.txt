Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Micah can type 20 words per minute
* Isaiah can type 40 words per minute
* We want to know how many more words Isaiah can type than Micah in an hour

First, let's calculate how many words Micah can type in an hour:
* 20 words per minute x 60 minutes = 1,200 words per hour

Next, let's calculate how many words Isaiah can type in an hour:
* 40 words per minute x 60 minutes = 2,400 words per hour

Now, to find the difference between how many words Isaiah and Micah can type in an hour, we subtract Micah's total from Isaiah's total:
* 2,400 words - 1,200 words = 1,200 words

Answer: 1,200
