Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dante needs half as many cups of flour as he needs eggs
* He uses 60 eggs in his recipe
* To find the number of cups of flour, we can divide the number of eggs by 2
* 60 eggs / 2 = 30 cups of flour
* Now, to find the total number of cups of flour and eggs, we add the number of cups of flour and the number of eggs:
* 30 cups of flour + 60 eggs = 90 total

Answer: 90
