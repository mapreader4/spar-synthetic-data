Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Owen bought 12 boxes of face masks at $9 per box. So the total cost of the 12 boxes is:
12 boxes x $9 per box = $108
2) Each box has 50 pieces of masks, so the total number of masks he bought is:
12 boxes x 50 pieces per box = 600 masks
3) He repacked 6 of these boxes and sold them for $5 per 25 pieces. So the revenue from selling these 6 boxes is:
(6 boxes x 50 pieces per box) / 25 pieces per sale x $5 per sale = $60
4) He sold the remaining 300 face masks in baggies at the rate of 10 pieces of mask for $3. So the revenue from selling these 300 masks is:
300 masks / 10 masks per sale x $3 per sale = $90
5) The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the 6 repacked boxes and the 300 masks in baggies:
$60 + $90 = $150
6) The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$150 - $108 = $42

Answer: $42
