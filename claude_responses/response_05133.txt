Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total amount of money raised at the fair is the sum of the entrance tickets, the raffle, and the sale of cakes and drinks.
2) Entrance tickets: $368
3) Raffle: $343
4) Cakes and drinks: $279
5) Total money raised = $368 + $343 + $279 = $990
6) The money raised needs to be shared among 5 classes.
7) To find the amount each class received, we divide the total money raised ($990) by the number of classes (5).
8) $990 / 5 = $198

Answer: $198
