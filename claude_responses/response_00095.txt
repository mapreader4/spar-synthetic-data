Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Alice has 20 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25.
2) She exchanges her 20 quarters for nickels at the bank.
3) Each nickel is worth $0.05.
4) To find the number of nickels she received, we divide the total value of her quarters ($0.25 x 20 = $5) by the value of each nickel ($0.05).
5) $5 / $0.05 = 100 nickels.
6) 20% of the 100 nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each.
7) 20% of 100 is 20 nickels.
8) The value of the 20 iron nickels is 20 x $3 = $60.
9) The remaining 80 nickels are worth 80 x $0.05 = $4.
10) The total value of Alice's money is $60 + $4 = $64.

Answer: 64
