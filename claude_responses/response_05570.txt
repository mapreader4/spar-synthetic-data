Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A small bonsai costs $30
* Lowry sold 3 small bonsai
* So the total revenue from the small bonsai is 3 x $30 = $90
* A big bonsai costs $20
* Lowry sold 5 big bonsai
* So the total revenue from the big bonsai is 5 x $20 = $100
* To calculate the total revenue, we add the revenue from the small bonsai and the big bonsai:
* $90 + $100 = $190

Answer: $190
