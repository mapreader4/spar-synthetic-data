Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pirates plan to explore 4 islands total
* 2 of the islands require walking 20 miles per day
* The other 2 islands require walking 25 miles per day
* It takes 1.5 days to explore each island

For the 2 islands that require 20 miles per day:
* 20 miles per day x 1.5 days = 30 miles per island
* 30 miles per island x 2 islands = 60 miles

For the 2 islands that require 25 miles per day:
* 25 miles per day x 1.5 days = 37.5 miles per island
* 37.5 miles per island x 2 islands = 75 miles

Now we add the total miles for all 4 islands:
* 60 miles + 75 miles = 135 miles

Answer: 135
