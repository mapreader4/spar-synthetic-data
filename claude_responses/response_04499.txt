Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Current job:
* 8 hours per week
* $10 per hour
* Weekly earnings = 8 hours x $10 per hour = $80 per week

New job:
* 4 hours per week
* $15 per hour
* $35 per week bonus for exceeding quota
* Weekly earnings = 4 hours x $15 per hour + $35 bonus = $95 per week

To calculate the difference in earnings:
* New job weekly earnings - Current job weekly earnings = $95 - $80 = $15 per week

Therefore, Maisy will earn $15 more per week at her new job.
