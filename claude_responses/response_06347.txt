Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rottweilers take 20 minutes to groom
* Karen has to groom 6 Rottweilers
* So, for the 6 Rottweilers, it will take 6 * 20 = 120 minutes

* Border collies take 10 minutes to groom
* Karen has to groom 9 border collies
* So, for the 9 border collies, it will take 9 * 10 = 90 minutes

* Chihuahuas take 45 minutes to groom
* Karen has to groom 1 chihuahua
* So, for the 1 chihuahua, it will take 45 minutes

* To calculate the total time, we add up the time for each type of dog:
* 120 minutes + 90 minutes + 45 minutes = 255 minutes
