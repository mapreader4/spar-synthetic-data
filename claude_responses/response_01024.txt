Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rafael works 10 hours on Monday
* Rafael works 8 hours on Tuesday
* So, in the first two days, Rafael has worked 10 + 8 = 18 hours
* Rafael has 20 hours left to work in the week
* So, the total number of hours Rafael will work in the week is 18 + 20 = 38 hours
* Rafael is paid $20 per hour
* To calculate his total earnings, we multiply the total hours worked (38) by the hourly rate ($20)
* 38 hours x $20 per hour = $760

Answer: $760
