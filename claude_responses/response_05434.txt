Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Kylie and Kayla picked a total of 340 apples together.
2) Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked.
3) Let's call the number of apples Kylie picked as x.
4) Then, the number of apples Kayla picked is 4x + 10.
5) We know that the total number of apples picked is 340, so we can write the equation:
x + (4x + 10) = 340
6) Solving for x, we get:
5x + 10 = 340
5x = 330
x = 66
7) So Kylie picked 66 apples.
8) Kayla picked 4 * 66 + 10 = 274 apples.

Answer: 274
