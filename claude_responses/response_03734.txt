Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry needs 500 cherries per quart of syrup
* It takes him 2 hours to pick 300 cherries
* It takes him 3 hours to make the syrup
* He needs to make 9 quarts of syrup

First, we need to calculate how many cherries he needs for 9 quarts of syrup:
* 500 cherries per quart x 9 quarts = 4,500 cherries

Next, we need to calculate how long it will take him to pick 4,500 cherries:
* 2 hours to pick 300 cherries
* 4,500 cherries / 300 cherries per 2 hours = 30 * 2 hours = 60 hours

Finally, we need to add the time it takes to make the syrup:
* 3 hours per quart x 9 quarts = 27 hours

The total time it will take Jerry to make 9 quarts of syrup is:
* 60 hours + 27 hours = 87 hours

Answer: 87
