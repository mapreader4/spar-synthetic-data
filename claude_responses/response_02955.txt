Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 30 students in the class
2) Mo wants to give a Valentine to 60% of the students
3) To calculate 60% of 30 students, we do: 0.6 * 30 = 18 students
4) Each Valentine card costs $2
5) To calculate the total cost of the 18 Valentine cards, we do: 18 * $2 = $36
6) Mo has $40 to spend
7) To calculate the percentage of his money he will spend, we do: ($36 / $40) * 100 = 90%

Answer: 90%
