Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John skateboarded for 10 miles to the park.
2) He then walked another 4 miles to the park.
3) So the total distance he traveled to the park was 10 miles + 4 miles = 14 miles.
4) He then skated all the way back home, which is another 14 miles.
5) Therefore, the total distance John skateboarded is 10 miles + 14 miles = 24 miles.
