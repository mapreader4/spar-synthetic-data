Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have the following distances traveled:
- Monday: 12 miles
- Tuesday: 18 miles
- Wednesday: 21 miles
2) To calculate the average distance traveled per day, we need to add up the total distance traveled and divide it by the number of days.
3) The total distance traveled is 12 miles + 18 miles + 21 miles = 51 miles.
4) The number of days is 3 (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).
5) To find the average, we divide the total distance by the number of days:
51 miles / 3 days = 17 miles per day.

Answer: 17
