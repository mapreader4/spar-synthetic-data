Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sammy can eat 15 pickle slices.
2) Tammy can eat twice as much as Sammy, so Tammy can eat 2 * 15 = 30 pickle slices.
3) Ron eats 20% fewer pickle slices than Tammy.
4) 20% of 30 is 0.2 * 30 = 6.
5) So Ron eats 30 - 6 = 24 pickle slices.

Answer: 24
