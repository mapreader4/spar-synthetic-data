Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marla has to drive 20 minutes one way to her son's school.
2) She then spends 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night.
3) After that, she has to drive the same amount of time (20 minutes) back home.
4) To calculate the total time spent on this errand, we add up the time for the three parts:
   - Driving to the school: 20 minutes
   - Attending parent-teacher night: 70 minutes
   - Driving back home: 20 minutes
5) The total time is 20 + 70 + 20 = 110 minutes.

Answer: 110
