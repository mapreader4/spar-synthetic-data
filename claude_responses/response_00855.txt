Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Noemi lost $400 on roulette
* Noemi lost $500 on blackjack
* Noemi still had $800 in her purse

To find out how much money Noemi began with, we need to add up the total amount of money she lost and the amount she still has in her purse.

The total amount of money she lost is:
* $400 (on roulette) + $500 (on blackjack) = $900

Now, we add the $900 she lost to the $800 she still has in her purse:
* $900 + $800 = $1,700

Therefore, Noemi began with $1,700.

Answer: 1,700
