Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gnuff charges a flat rate of $20 per tutoring session
* Gnuff also charges $7 per minute
* The total amount paid for one tutoring session is $146

To find the number of minutes Gnuff tutored for, we need to set up an equation:
* Total amount paid = Flat rate + (Rate per minute * Number of minutes)
* $146 = $20 + ($7 * Number of minutes)
* $146 - $20 = $7 * Number of minutes
* $126 = $7 * Number of minutes
* Number of minutes = $126 / $7
* Number of minutes = 18

Therefore, the number of minutes Gnuff tutored for is 18 minutes.

Answer: 18
