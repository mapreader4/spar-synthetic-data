Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lucy started with a 500g bag of flour
* On Tuesday, she used 240g of flour to bake cookies
* So, the amount of flour left after baking the cookies is 500g - 240g = 260g
* She then accidentally spilled half of the remaining 260g
* The amount of flour she spilled is 260g / 2 = 130g
* The amount of flour left in the cupboard is 260g - 130g = 130g
* Lucy wants a full 500g bag of flour in the cupboard
* To get a full 500g bag, she needs to buy 500g - 130g = 370g of flour

Answer: 370g
