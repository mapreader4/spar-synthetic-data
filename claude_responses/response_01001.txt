Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The plant supplier sold:
   - 20 pieces of orchids for $50 each
   - 15 pieces of potted Chinese money plant for $25 each

2. To calculate the total earnings from the sales:
   - Orchids: 20 x $50 = $1,000
   - Chinese money plant: 15 x $25 = $375
   - Total earnings = $1,000 + $375 = $1,375

3. The plant supplier then paid his two workers $40 each, which is:
   - 2 workers x $40 = $80

4. The plant supplier also bought new pots worth $150.

5. To calculate the money left from the plant supplier's earnings:
   - Total earnings: $1,375
   - Payments to workers: $80
   - Cost of new pots: $150
   - Money left = $1,375 - $80 - $150 = $1,145

Answer: $1,145
