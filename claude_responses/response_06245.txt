Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Shawna has 7 acorns.
2) Sheila has 5 times as many acorns as Shawna. So, Sheila has 5 x 7 = 35 acorns.
3) Danny has 3 more acorns than Sheila. So, Danny has 35 + 3 = 38 acorns.

Now, to find the total number of acorns they have altogether, we add up the acorns of Shawna, Sheila, and Danny:
7 + 35 + 38 = 80 acorns

Answer: 80
