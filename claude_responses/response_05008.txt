Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The machine has 16 red gumballs.
2) The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. So, if the machine has 16 red gumballs, it has 8 blue gumballs (half of 16).
3) For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. So, if the machine has 8 blue gumballs, it has 32 green gumballs (8 x 4).
4) To find the total number of gumballs in the machine, we add the number of red, blue, and green gumballs:
   Red gumballs: 16
   Blue gumballs: 8
   Green gumballs: 32
   Total gumballs: 16 + 8 + 32 = 56

Answer: 56
