Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 140 kids in the junior prom
* A fourth of them were dancers
* To find the number of dancers, we take 140 and divide it by 4:
    * 140 / 4 = 35 dancers
* Of the 35 dancers, 25 danced the slow dance
* To find the number of dancers who did not slow dance, we subtract the number of dancers who did slow dance from the total number of dancers:
    * 35 - 25 = 10 dancers did not slow dance

Answer: 10
