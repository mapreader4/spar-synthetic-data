Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The box has two long sides that measure 8 inches by 6 inches. The area of each long side is 8 inches * 6 inches = 48 square inches.
2) The box has two short sides that measure 5 inches by 6 inches. The area of each short side is 5 inches * 6 inches = 30 square inches.
3) The box has a top and a bottom that each measure 40 square inches.
4) To calculate the total area of velvet needed, we add up the areas of the two long sides, the two short sides, and the top and bottom:
48 square inches + 48 square inches + 30 square inches + 30 square inches + 40 square inches + 40 square inches = 236 square inches.

Answer: 236
