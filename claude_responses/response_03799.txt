Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Suzy is 20 years old now
* In four years, Suzy will be 24 years old
* In four years, Suzy will be twice Mary's age then
* So, if Suzy is 24 in four years, and she will be twice Mary's age, that means Mary's age in four years will be 24 / 2 = 12
* Therefore, Mary's current age is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.
