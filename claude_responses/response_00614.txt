Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maisie dropped off 33 flyers on the shorter left street
* Donna dropped off five more than twice as many flyers as Maisie
* To find how many flyers Donna dropped off, we need to:
    1. Calculate twice the number of flyers Maisie dropped off
    2. Add 5 to that number

Step 1: Calculate twice the number of flyers Maisie dropped off
* Maisie dropped off 33 flyers
* Twice the number of flyers Maisie dropped off is 2 x 33 = 66

Step 2: Add 5 to that number
* 66 + 5 = 71

Therefore, Donna dropped off 71 flyers.

Answer: 71
