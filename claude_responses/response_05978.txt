Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each bracelet uses 12 large beads
* Each bracelet uses twice as many small beads as large beads
* So, each bracelet uses 24 small beads (2 x 12)
* Caitlin has 528 beads in total, with equal amounts of large and small beads
* Since each bracelet uses 12 large beads, Caitlin has 528 / 2 = 264 large beads
* This means she has 264 small beads as well
* To find the number of bracelets she can make, we need to find the limiting factor - either the number of large beads or the number of small beads
* With 264 large beads, she can make 264 / 12 = 22 bracelets
* With 264 small beads, she can make 264 / 24 = 11 bracelets
* The limiting factor is the small beads, so she can make 11 bracelets.
