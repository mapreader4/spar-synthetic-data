Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Rangers Apprentice series has 14 books
* Each book has 200 pages
* In the first month, Sabrina read 4 books
* In the second month, Sabrina read half the remaining books

First, let's calculate the number of pages Sabrina read in the first month:
* 4 books x 200 pages per book = 800 pages

Now, let's calculate the number of books remaining after the first month:
* 14 books - 4 books = 10 books

In the second month, Sabrina read half the remaining books:
* 10 books / 2 = 5 books

So, the total number of pages Sabrina read in the second month is:
* 5 books x 200 pages per book = 1,000 pages

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages Sabrina has left to read to finish the series:
* 14 books x 200 pages per book = 2,800 pages
* Pages read in first month: 800 pages
* Pages read in second month: 1,000 pages
* Pages remaining: 2,800 - 800 - 1,000 = 1,000 pages

Answer: 1,000 pages
