Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that the ratio of goats to sheep on the farm is 5:7. This means that the total number of animals is 12 (5 + 7).
2) Since the total number of animals is 360, we can calculate the number of goats and sheep:
* Total animals = 360
* Ratio of goats to sheep = 5:7
* Number of goats = (5/12) * 360 = 150
* Number of sheep = (7/12) * 360 = 210
3) Mr. Mathews decides to sell half of the goats at $40 each. So, he sells 75 goats (half of 150) at $40 each, making $3,000.
4) He also decides to sell 2/3 of the sheep at $30 each. So, he sells 140 sheep (2/3 of 210) at $30 each, making $4,200.
5) The total money he makes from the sale of the animals is the sum of the money made from selling the goats and the sheep:
* Total money = $3,000 + $4,200 = $7,200

Answer: $7,200
