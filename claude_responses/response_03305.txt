Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Du Chin bakes 200 meat pies in a day.
2) He sells them for $20 each.
3) The total sales from the 200 meat pies is:
   * 200 meat pies x $20 per pie = $4,000
4) He uses 3/5 of the sales to buy ingredients for the next day.
   * 3/5 of $4,000 = $2,400
5) The amount of money Du Chin remains with after setting aside the money for buying ingredients is:
   * $4,000 - $2,400 = $1,600

Answer: $1,600
