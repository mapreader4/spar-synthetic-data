Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mark started the day with 14 buttons.
2) His friend Shane gave him 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 buttons.
3) So now Mark has 14 + 42 = 56 buttons.
4) Then, his other friend Sam asked for half of Mark's buttons. Half of 56 is 56 / 2 = 28 buttons.
5) So Mark ended up with 56 - 28 = 28 buttons.

Answer: 28
