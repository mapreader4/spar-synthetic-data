Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jacob earns $6 per hour.
2) Jake earns thrice what Jacob does, so Jake earns $18 per hour (3 x $6 = $18).
3) Jacob works 8 hours per day.
4) Therefore, Jacob earns $48 per day (8 hours x $6 per hour = $48).
5) Jake also works 8 hours per day.
6) Therefore, Jake earns $144 per day (8 hours x $18 per hour = $144).
7) Jake works for 5 days.
8) Therefore, Jake earns $720 in 5 days (5 days x $144 per day = $720).

Answer: $720
