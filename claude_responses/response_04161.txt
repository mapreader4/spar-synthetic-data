Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Wells has a garden with 50 rows of flowers.
2) Each row has 400 flowers.
3) To find the total number of flowers in the garden, we multiply the number of rows (50) by the number of flowers per row (400):
50 rows x 400 flowers/row = 20,000 total flowers
4) Mr. Wells cuts 60% of the flowers.
5) To find the number of flowers remaining, we need to find 40% of the total flowers (100% - 60% = 40%).
6) 40% of 20,000 flowers = 0.40 x 20,000 = 8,000 flowers remaining.

Answer: 8,000
