Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Donna bought 3 times as many pencils as Marcia did. So if Marcia bought x pencils, then Donna bought 3x pencils.
2) Marcia bought double the number of pencils as Cindi did. So if Cindi bought y pencils, then Marcia bought 2y pencils.
3) Cindi spent $30 on $0.50 pencils. So Cindi bought 60 pencils (since $30 / $0.50 = 60).
4) Therefore, Marcia bought 2 * 60 = 120 pencils.
5) And Donna bought 3 * 120 = 360 pencils.
6) The total number of pencils bought by Donna and Marcia is 360 + 120 = 480 pencils.

Answer: 480
