Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The red notes were in 5 rows with 6 notes in each row.
   * So the total number of red notes is 5 rows x 6 notes per row = 30 red notes.

2. There are 2 blue notes under each of the red notes.
   * Since there are 30 red notes, there are 30 x 2 = 60 blue notes under the red notes.

3. There are another 10 blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board.
   * So the total number of blue notes is 60 + 10 = 70 blue notes.

4. The total number of notes put into the complaints bin is the number of red notes, which is 30.
5. The total number of notes put into the compliments bin is the number of blue notes, which is 70.
