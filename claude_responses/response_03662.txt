Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tory needs to sell 50 packs of cookies for the fundraiser
* So far, he has sold:
    - 12 packs to his grandmother
    - 7 packs to his uncle
    - 5 packs to a neighbor
* To calculate the total number of packs he has sold so far, we add these up:
    - 12 + 7 + 5 = 24 packs
* To find how many more packs he needs to sell, we subtract the number of packs he has already sold from the total he needs to sell:
    - 50 - 24 = 26 packs

Answer: 26
