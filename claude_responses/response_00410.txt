Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The current record for most consecutive ropes jumped is 54,000
* Mark can jump 3 times per second
* To find the number of hours needed, we need to first find the total number of seconds it would take to jump 54,000 ropes
* 54,000 ropes / 3 jumps per second = 18,000 seconds
* Now, to convert seconds to hours, we divide 18,000 seconds by 3,600 seconds per hour (since there are 3,600 seconds in an hour)
* 18,000 seconds / 3,600 seconds per hour = 5 hours

Answer: 5 hours
