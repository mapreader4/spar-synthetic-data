Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Lisa bought a new iPhone for $1000.
2. She bought a phone contract that costs $200 per month.
3. She bought a case that costs 20% of the cost of the phone.
   * The cost of the case is 20% of $1000, which is $200.
4. She bought headphones that cost half as much as the case.
   * The cost of the headphones is half of $200, which is $100.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lisa will spend in the first year:
* Phone cost: $1000
* Phone contract for 12 months: $200 x 12 = $2400
* Case: $200
* Headphones: $100
* Total cost in the first year: $1000 + $2400 + $200 + $100 = $3700

Answer: $3700
