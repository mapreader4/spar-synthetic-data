Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Delaney has to catch a bus that leaves at 8:00 a.m. every day
* It takes him 30 minutes to reach the pick-up point from his home
* One day, he woke up late and left his home at 7:50 a.m.

To calculate how much time he missed the bus by, we need to find the difference between the time he reached the pick-up point and the time the bus left.

* Delaney left his home at 7:50 a.m.
* It takes him 30 minutes to reach the pick-up point
* So, he would have reached the pick-up point at 8:20 a.m.
* The bus left at 8:00 a.m.
* Therefore, Delaney missed the bus by 20 minutes.

Answer: 20
