Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mitch has saved $20,000 to finance his boating hobby.
2) A new boat costs $1,500 per foot in length.
3) Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration.
4) Mitch also needs to keep three times that amount for docking fees, which is $1,500.
5) So, the total amount Mitch needs to keep for license, registration, and docking fees is $500 + $1,500 = $2,000.
6) The remaining amount Mitch has to spend on the boat is $20,000 - $2,000 = $18,000.
7) To find the longest boat Mitch can buy, we divide the remaining amount ($18,000) by the cost per foot ($1,500):
18,000 / 1,500 = 12 feet.

Answer: 12 feet.
