Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Alice is planting bushes around three sides of her yard.
2) Each side of the yard is 16 feet long.
3) Each bush fills 4 feet.
4) To calculate the number of bushes needed, we need to find the total length of the three sides and divide it by the length of each bush.
5) The total length of the three sides is 16 feet + 16 feet + 16 feet = 48 feet.
6) Since each bush fills 4 feet, we divide the total length of 48 feet by 4 feet per bush.
7) 48 feet / 4 feet per bush = 12 bushes.

Answer: 12
