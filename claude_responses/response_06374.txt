Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jen did 16 triple-flips during practice
* A triple-flip is 3 flips in the air
* So, the total number of flips Jen did is 16 * 3 = 48 flips
* Tyler flipped in the air half the number of times Jen did
* Since Jen did 48 flips, Tyler did half of that, which is 48 / 2 = 24 flips
* A double-flip is 2 flips in the air
* Therefore, the number of double-flips Tyler did is 24 / 2 = 12 double-flips

Answer: 12
