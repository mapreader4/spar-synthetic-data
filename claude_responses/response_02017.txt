Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jed's family wants to buy 6 different board games.
2) Each board game costs $15.
3) To calculate the total cost of the 6 board games, we multiply the number of board games (6) by the cost of each board game ($15):
6 x $15 = $90
4) Jed paid using a $100 bill.
5) To calculate the change Jed received, we subtract the total cost ($90) from the amount Jed paid ($100):
$100 - $90 = $10
6) The cashier gave Jed the change in $5 bills.
7) To calculate the number of $5 bills Jed received, we divide the change ($10) by the value of each bill ($5):
$10 / $5 = 2 bills

Answer: 2 bills
