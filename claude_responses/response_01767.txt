Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Juvy's garden has 20 rows with 10 plants in each row
* That means the total number of plants in the garden is 20 rows x 10 plants per row = 200 plants
* Juvy plants parsley in the first 3 rows, which is 3 rows x 10 plants per row = 30 plants
* Juvy plants rosemary in the last 2 rows, which is 2 rows x 10 plants per row = 20 plants
* The remaining rows are planted with chives
* The number of rows planted with chives is the total rows (20) minus the rows planted with parsley (3) and rosemary (2), which is 20 - 3 - 2 = 15 rows
* So the number of chives Juvy will plant is 15 rows x 10 plants per row = 150 plants

Answer: 150
