Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 24 students in the class
* One-third of the students are in the after-school chess program
* To find one-third of 24, we can divide 24 by 3:
* 24 / 3 = 8 students are in the after-school chess program
* Half of the 8 students in the chess program will be absent for the regional chess tournament
* To find half of 8, we can divide 8 by 2:
* 8 / 2 = 4 students will be going to the regional chess tournament
