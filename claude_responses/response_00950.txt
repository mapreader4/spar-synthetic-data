Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Theodore can craft 10 stone statues and 20 wooden statues every month.
2. A stone statue costs $20 and a wooden statue costs $5.
3. To calculate his total earnings before taxes, we need to find the total revenue from selling the statues:
   * Revenue from stone statues: 10 statues x $20 per statue = $200
   * Revenue from wooden statues: 20 statues x $5 per statue = $100
   * Total revenue = $200 + $100 = $300

4. He pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes.
   * Total earnings = $300
   * Taxes = 10% of $300 = $30

5. His total earnings after taxes is:
   * Total earnings = $300 - $30 = $270

Answer: $270
