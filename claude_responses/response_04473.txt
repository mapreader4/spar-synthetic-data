Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony read 23 books
* Dean read 12 books
* Breanna read 17 books
* Tony and Dean read 3 of the same books
* All three (Tony, Dean, and Breanna) read 1 of the same book

To find the total number of different books read, we need to add up the number of books read by each person, and then subtract the number of books that were read by more than one person.

* Total books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna: 23 + 12 + 17 = 52
* Books read by both Tony and Dean: 3
* Books read by all three: 1

So the total number of different books read is:
* 52 - 3 - 1 = 48

Answer: 48
