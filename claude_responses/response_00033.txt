Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kimber needs 10 cups of water to make the pizza.
2) Kimber needs 16 cups of flour to make the pizza.
3) Kimber needs 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour.
   * The number of cups of flour is 16.
   * 1/2 times 16 is 8 teaspoons of salt.
4) To calculate the combined total, we add up the cups of water, cups of flour, and teaspoons of salt:
   * 10 cups of water
   * 16 cups of flour
   * 8 teaspoons of salt
