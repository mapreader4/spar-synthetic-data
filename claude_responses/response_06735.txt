Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Avery puts 4 shirts in the donation box
* He adds twice as many pants as shirts in the box
* So, the number of pants is 2 x 4 = 8 pants
* He throws in half as many shorts as pants in the box
* So, the number of shorts is 1/2 x 8 = 4 shorts
* In total, the number of pieces of clothes Avery is donating is:
* 4 shirts + 8 pants + 4 shorts = 16 pieces of clothes

Answer: 16
