Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Calum needs to buy 4 disco balls and 10 boxes of food
* Each box of food costs $25
* Calum's budget for the disco balls and food is $330

First, let's calculate the total cost of the food:
* 10 boxes of food x $25 per box = $250

Now, we can subtract the cost of the food from the total budget to get the amount left for the disco balls:
* $330 - $250 = $80

Since Calum needs to buy 4 disco balls, we can divide the remaining budget by 4 to get the amount he can afford to spend on each disco ball:
* $80 / 4 = $20

Answer: $20
