Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bakery makes 3 batches of baguettes a day.
2) Each batch has 48 baguettes.
3) After the first batch, he sold 37 baguettes.
4) After the second batch, he sold 52 baguettes.
5) After the third batch, he sold 49 baguettes.
6) To calculate the total number of baguettes made, we multiply the number of batches (3) by the number of baguettes per batch (48): 3 * 48 = 144 baguettes.
7) To calculate the total number of baguettes sold, we add up the number of baguettes sold after each batch: 37 + 52 + 49 = 138 baguettes.
8) To calculate the number of baguettes left, we subtract the total number of baguettes sold (138) from the total number of baguettes made (144): 144 - 138 = 6 baguettes.
