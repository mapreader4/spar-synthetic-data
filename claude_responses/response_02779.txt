Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Olaf's dad scored 7 points
* Olaf scored three times more points than his dad
* To find Olaf's score, we multiply his dad's score by 3:
  * Olaf's score = 3 x 7 = 21 points
* To find the total points scored, we add Olaf's score and his dad's score:
  * Total points = Olaf's score + Dad's score
  * Total points = 21 + 7 = 28 points

Answer: 28
