Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Hajar's score in the game is 24 points.
2) The difference in the scores between Hajar and Farah's score is 21.
3) Since the question states that Farah's score is higher than Hajar's, we can deduce that Farah's score is 24 + 21 = 45 points.
4) The sum of Hajar and Farah's scores is Hajar's score (24) plus Farah's score (45), which is 24 + 45 = 69.

Answer: 69
