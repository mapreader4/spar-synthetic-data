Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Louie scored 4 goals in the last match of the season
* His brother scored twice as many goals as Louie in each game he's played
* His brother has been on the team for 3 seasons
* Each season has 50 games

First, let's calculate the number of goals Louie's brother scored:
* Louie's brother scored twice as many goals as Louie in each game
* Louie scored 4 goals in the last match
* So Louie's brother scored 2 x 4 = 8 goals in the last match

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals Louie's brother scored over the 3 seasons:
* Louie's brother scored 8 goals in each of the 50 games per season
* So in each season, Louie's brother scored 8 x 50 = 400 goals
* Over 3 seasons, Louie's brother scored 3 x 400 = 1,200 goals

Finally, let's calculate the total number of goals the brothers have scored:
* Louie scored 40 goals in previous matches
* Louie scored 4 goals in the last match
* So Louie scored a total of 40 + 4 = 44 goals
* Louie's brother scored 1,200 goals
* The total number of goals the brothers have scored is 44 + 1,200 = 1,244

Answer: 1,244
