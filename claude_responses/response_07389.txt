Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Teresa is currently 59 years old
* Morio is currently 71 years old
* Michiko was born when Morio was 38 years old
* To find Teresa's age when she gave birth to Michiko, we need to calculate the difference between Morio's age when Michiko was born (38) and Morio's current age (71)
* 71 - 38 = 33 years
* This means that Michiko is currently 33 years old
* Since Teresa is currently 59 years old, and Michiko is 33 years old, that means Teresa was 26 years old when she gave birth to Michiko.

Answer: 26
