Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Donny's truck holds 150 liters of fuel.
2) His truck already contained 38 liters of fuel.
3) So, the amount of fuel he needs to add is 150 liters - 38 liters = 112 liters.
4) Each liter of fuel costs $3.
5) The total cost of 112 liters of fuel is 112 liters * $3/liter = $336.
6) Donny paid with $350.
7) The change he will get is $350 - $336 = $14.
