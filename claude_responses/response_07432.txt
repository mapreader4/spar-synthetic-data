Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes 10 minutes to wash a car
* Mike washes 9 cars
* So the total time to wash 9 cars is 9 * 10 minutes = 90 minutes
* It takes 15 minutes to change the oil on one car
* Mike changes the oil on 6 cars
* So the total time to change the oil on 6 cars is 6 * 15 minutes = 90 minutes
* It takes 30 minutes to change a set of tires
* Mike changes 2 sets of tires
* So the total time to change 2 sets of tires is 2 * 30 minutes = 60 minutes
* To calculate the total time worked, we add up the times for each task:
* 90 minutes + 90 minutes + 60 minutes = 240 minutes
* To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
* 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Answer: 4 hours
