Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lidia's collection is 4 times bigger than Susan's collection.
2) The total number of books between Susan and Lidia is 3000.
3) Let's represent Susan's collection as x.
4) Since Lidia's collection is 4 times bigger than Susan's, Lidia's collection can be represented as 4x.
5) The total number of books is the sum of Susan's and Lidia's collections: x + 4x = 3000
6) Simplifying the equation: 5x = 3000
7) Solving for x: x = 3000/5 = 600

Answer: 600
