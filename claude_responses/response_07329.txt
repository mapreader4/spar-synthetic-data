Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The shoebox is 4 inches tall and 6 inches wide.
2) The square block inside the box is 4 inches per side.
3) To find the area of the box that is left uncovered, we need to subtract the area of the square block from the area of the box.
4) The area of the box is 4 inches x 6 inches = 24 square inches.
5) The area of the square block is 4 inches x 4 inches = 16 square inches.
6) The area of the box left uncovered is 24 square inches - 16 square inches = 8 square inches.
