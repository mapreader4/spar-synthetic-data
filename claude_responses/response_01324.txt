Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adam spends two-thirds as much money on lunch as Rick.
2) Rick and Jose eat lunch of the same price.
3) Jose ate lunch worth $45.

Since Rick and Jose eat lunch of the same price, and Jose's lunch cost $45, then Rick's lunch also cost $45.

Now, we know that Adam spends two-thirds as much money on lunch as Rick. So, we can calculate Adam's lunch cost as:
* Adam's lunch cost = 2/3 * Rick's lunch cost
* Adam's lunch cost = 2/3 * $45 = $30

Therefore, the total cost of lunch for all three friends is:
* Total cost = Adam's lunch cost + Rick's lunch cost + Jose's lunch cost
* Total cost = $30 + $45 + $45 = $120

Answer: $120
