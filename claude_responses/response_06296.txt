Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The craftsman made 16 jars.
2) This is exactly twice the number of clay pots he made. So, if he made 16 jars, he must have made half that number of clay pots, which is 8 clay pots.
3) Each jar has 5 marbles.
4) Each clay pot has three times as many marbles as each jar, which means each clay pot has 15 marbles.
5) To find the total number of marbles, we add the number of marbles in the jars and the number of marbles in the clay pots:
   * Marbles in jars: 16 jars x 5 marbles per jar = 80 marbles
   * Marbles in clay pots: 8 clay pots x 15 marbles per clay pot = 120 marbles
6) The total number of marbles is 80 + 120 = 200 marbles.

Answer: 200
