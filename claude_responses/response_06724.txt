Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first 3 baskets contain:
  - 9 apples
  - 15 oranges
  - 14 bananas
* The fourth basket contains:
  - 9 - 2 = 7 apples
  - 15 - 2 = 13 oranges
  - 14 - 2 = 12 bananas
* To find the total number of fruits, we add up the fruits in all 4 baskets:
  - Apples: 9 + 9 + 9 + 7 = 34
  - Oranges: 15 + 15 + 15 + 13 = 58
  - Bananas: 14 + 14 + 14 + 12 = 54
* The total number of fruits is the sum of the apples, oranges, and bananas:
  - 34 + 58 + 54 = 146

Answer: 146
