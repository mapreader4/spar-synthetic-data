Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The factory produces 90 refrigerators per hour
* The factory produces 70 more coolers than refrigerators per hour
* So, the factory produces 90 + 70 = 160 coolers per hour
* The factory works 9 hours per day
* The factory works for 5 days

To find the total number of products produced, we need to calculate the number of refrigerators and coolers produced per day, and then multiply that by the number of days.

Refrigerators produced per day:
* 90 refrigerators per hour x 9 hours per day = 810 refrigerators per day

Coolers produced per day:
* 160 coolers per hour x 9 hours per day = 1,440 coolers per day

Total products produced in 5 days:
* (810 refrigerators per day + 1,440 coolers per day) x 5 days = 11,250 total products

Answer: 11,250
