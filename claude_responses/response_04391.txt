Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Libby has 160 quarters in her piggy bank.
2) 1 quarter is worth $0.25.
3) To calculate the total amount of money Libby has in her piggy bank, we multiply the number of quarters (160) by the value of each quarter ($0.25):
160 quarters x $0.25 per quarter = $40
4) Libby needs to pay $35 to replace her sister's dress.
5) To calculate the number of quarters Libby will have left, we subtract the amount she needs to pay ($35) from the total amount she has in her piggy bank ($40):
$40 - $35 = $5
6) Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can divide the remaining $5 by $0.25 to get the number of quarters Libby will have left:
$5 / $0.25 = 20 quarters

Answer: 20
