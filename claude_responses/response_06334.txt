Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jaydee can type 38 words per minute.
2) The research paper has 4560 words.
3) To find the time it will take Jaydee to type the entire paper, we need to divide the total number of words by the number of words he can type per minute.
4) 4560 words / 38 words per minute = 120 minutes.
5) To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60.
6) 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours.

Answer: 2 hours
