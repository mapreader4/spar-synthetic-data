Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anya washes 32 hairs down the drain when she washes her hair
* She brushes out half that amount when she brushes it
* To find how many hairs she brushed out, we take half of 32, which is 16
* So, in total, Anya lost 32 + 16 = 48 hairs
* To always have one more hair than she started with, she needs to grow back 49 hairs

Answer: 49
