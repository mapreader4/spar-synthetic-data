Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jaylen's dog eats 1 cup of dog food in the morning and 1 cup in the evening
* So the dog eats a total of 2 cups of dog food per day (1 cup in the morning + 1 cup in the evening)
* Jaylen buys a bag that has 32 cups of dog food
* To find how many days she can feed her dog with the 32 cups of dog food, we divide the total cups of dog food (32) by the amount the dog eats per day (2 cups)

Answer: 16 days
