Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak and a $5 drink, so the total bill before tip is:
   2 x ($20 + $5) = 2 x $25 = $50
2) The total tip is 20% of $50, which is 0.20 x $50 = $10
3) Billy wants to cover 80% of the $10 tip, which is 0.80 x $10 = $8
Answer: $8
