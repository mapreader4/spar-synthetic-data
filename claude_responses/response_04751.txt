Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Billy made 49 sandwiches
2) Katelyn made 47 more sandwiches than Billy, so Katelyn made 49 + 47 = 96 sandwiches
3) Chloe made a quarter of the amount that Katelyn made, so Chloe made 96 / 4 = 24 sandwiches
4) To find the total number of sandwiches made, we add up the sandwiches made by Billy, Katelyn, and Chloe:
49 + 96 + 24 = 169

Answer: 169
