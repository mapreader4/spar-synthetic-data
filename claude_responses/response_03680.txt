Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tirzah has a total of 26 purses and 24 handbags
* Half of the purses are fake, so the number of genuine purses is 26 - (26 / 2) = 13 genuine purses
* 1/4 of the handbags are fake, so the number of genuine handbags is 24 - (24 / 4) = 18 genuine handbags
* The total number of genuine purses and handbags is 13 + 18 = 31

Answer: 31
