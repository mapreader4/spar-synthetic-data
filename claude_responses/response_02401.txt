Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The tiger escapes at 1 AM and is not noticed missing until 4 AM. That means he had a 3-hour head start.
2. During this 3-hour head start, he was running at a speed of 25 mph.
3. So in the first 3 hours, the tiger covered a distance of 25 mph x 3 hours = 75 miles.
4. It then takes 2 more hours to find him. During this time, he is still running at 25 mph.
5. So in the additional 2 hours, he covers a distance of 25 mph x 2 hours = 50 miles.
6. The total distance covered so far is 75 miles + 50 miles = 125 miles.
7. After 4 hours of running, the tiger slows his speed to 10 mph.
8. He then gets chased for half an hour going 50 mph.
9. The distance covered in the final half hour is 50 mph x 0.5 hours = 25 miles.
10. The total distance the tiger was caught from the zoo is 125 miles + 25 miles = 150 miles.

Answer: 150 miles
