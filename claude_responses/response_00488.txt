Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mrs. Smith wanted to buy wears worth $500.
2) She realized she would need two-fifths more money than she had.
   * Two-fifths of $500 is $200.
   * So, the total cost of the wears she picked out is $500 + $200 = $700.
3) The shop owner gave her a 15% discount.
   * 15% of $700 is 0.15 * $700 = $105.
   * So, the discounted price is $700 - $105 = $595.
4) Mrs. Smith had $500 to start with.
   * The amount she still needs is $595 - $500 = $95.

Answer: $95
