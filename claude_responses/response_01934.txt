Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeff rented the apartment for 5 years
* For the first 3 years, he paid $300 per month
* For the remaining 2 years, he paid $350 per month

First, let's calculate the total amount he paid for the first 3 years:
* 3 years x 12 months per year x $300 per month = $10,800

Then, let's calculate the total amount he paid for the remaining 2 years:
* 2 years x 12 months per year x $350 per month = $8,400

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount Jeff paid for the apartment throughout the 5 years:
* $10,800 + $8,400 = $19,200

Answer: 19,200
