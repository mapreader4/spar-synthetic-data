Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cafe initially has 16 chefs and 16 waiters
* 6 chefs and 3 waiters drop out
* To find the number of chefs and waiters left, we need to subtract the number of chefs and waiters who dropped out from the initial numbers
* For the chefs:
  * Initial number of chefs: 16
  * Number of chefs who dropped out: 6
  * Number of chefs left: 16 - 6 = 10
* For the waiters:
  * Initial number of waiters: 16
  * Number of waiters who dropped out: 3
  * Number of waiters left: 16 - 3 = 13

Answer: 10 chefs and 13 waiters are left.
