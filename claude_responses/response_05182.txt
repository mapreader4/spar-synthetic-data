Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kate bought 3 magic wands
* She bought one for herself and two for her friends
* She sold the two wands to her friends for $5 more than she paid
* She collected a total of $130 after the sale

To find the cost of each wand, we need to set up an equation:
* Let x = the cost of each wand
* Kate collected $130 in total
* She sold the two wands to her friends for $5 more than she paid, so each wand was sold for x + $5
* Therefore, the total amount she collected was: 2 * (x + $5) = $130

Solving for x:
* 2x + $10 = $130
* 2x = $120
* x = $60

Therefore, each wand cost $60.

Answer: $60
