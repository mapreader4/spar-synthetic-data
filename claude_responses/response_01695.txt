Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In Tara's first year playing soccer, she played 20 games.
2. Tara's dad attended 90% of the games in the first year.
3. To calculate the number of games Tara's dad attended in the first year, we multiply the total number of games (20) by the percentage (90%):
   20 games x 0.90 = 18 games

4. In Tara's second year playing soccer, she also played 20 games.
5. In the second year, Tara's dad attended 4 fewer games than he did in the previous year.
6. So, to calculate the number of games Tara's dad attended in the second year, we take the number of games he attended in the first year (18) and subtract 4:
   18 games - 4 games = 14 games

Answer: 14 games
