Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt takes 2 minutes per problem with a calculator
* Matt takes 5 minutes per problem without a calculator
* The assignment has 20 problems

First, let's calculate the total time it would take Matt to complete the assignment with a calculator:
* 2 minutes per problem x 20 problems = 40 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time it would take Matt to complete the assignment without a calculator:
* 5 minutes per problem x 20 problems = 100 minutes

To find the time saved by using a calculator, we subtract the time with a calculator from the time without a calculator:
* 100 minutes - 40 minutes = 60 minutes

Answer: 60 minutes
