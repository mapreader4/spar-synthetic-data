Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that it takes David 10 minutes to wash 4 windows.
2) This means that it takes David 2.5 minutes to wash 1 window (10 minutes / 4 windows = 2.5 minutes per window).
3) David's house has 64 windows.
4) To find the total time it will take David to wash all 64 windows, we multiply the time it takes to wash 1 window (2.5 minutes) by the total number of windows (64).
5) 2.5 minutes per window x 64 windows = 160 minutes.

Answer: 160 minutes
