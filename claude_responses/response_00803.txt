Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The teacher has 25 students total
* 11 students want the vampire-themed bag
* 14 students want the pumpkin-themed bag
* The store sells packs of 5 of each theme at $3 per package
* The store also sells individual bags of each theme at $1 each

To get the least amount of money spent, we need to determine the most efficient way to buy the bags.

First, let's calculate the number of packs of each theme the teacher needs to buy:
* For the vampire-themed bags, the teacher needs 11 bags. Since the packs are sold in sets of 5, the teacher needs to buy 3 packs (3 x 5 = 15 bags).
* For the pumpkin-themed bags, the teacher needs 14 bags. Since the packs are sold in sets of 5, the teacher needs to buy 3 packs (3 x 5 = 15 bags).

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
* 3 packs of vampire-themed bags at $3 per pack = $9
* 3 packs of pumpkin-themed bags at $3 per pack = $9
* Total cost of packs = $9 + $9 = $18

Since the teacher needs to buy every student the theme they requested, the teacher will need to buy 1 individual bag for the remaining 2 vampire-themed bags (2 x $1 = $2).

Therefore, the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags is:
Answer: $18 + $2 = $20
