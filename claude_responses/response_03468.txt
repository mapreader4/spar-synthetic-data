Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pepe is 4 feet 6 inches tall
* Frank is half a foot taller than Pepe
* Frank's height = Pepe's height + 0.5 feet = 4.5 feet
* Larry is 1 foot taller than Frank
* Larry's height = Frank's height + 1 foot = 5.5 feet
* Ben is 1 foot taller than Larry
* Ben's height = Larry's height + 1 foot = 6.5 feet
* Big Joe is 1 foot taller than Ben
* Big Joe's height = Ben's height + 1 foot = 7.5 feet

Answer: 7.5 feet
