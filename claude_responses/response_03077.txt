Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Tracy initially had 300 book donations
* In a week, 10 people came and donated 5 books each
* To calculate the number of books added from the 10 people:
  * 10 people x 5 books each = 50 books added
* So the total number of books in the store before borrowing is:
  * 300 (initial) + 50 (added) = 350 books
* Then, 140 books were borrowed by other people
* To calculate the number of books remaining, we take the total number of books and subtract the number of books borrowed:
  * 350 (total) - 140 (borrowed) = 210 books remaining

Answer: 210
