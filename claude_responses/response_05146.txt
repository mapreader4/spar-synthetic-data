Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The cost of a single bagel is $2.25.
2) The cost of a dozen bagels is $24.
3) To find the cost per bagel when buying a dozen, we divide $24 by 12, which gives us $2 per bagel.
4) The difference between the cost of a single bagel ($2.25) and the cost per bagel when buying a dozen ($2) is $0.25.
5) Converting this to cents, the amount saved per bagel by buying a dozen is 25 cents.

Answer: 25
