Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The distance from Anthony's apartment to work is 10 miles.
2) The distance from Anthony's apartment to the gym is 2 miles more than half the distance from his apartment to work.
3) To find half the distance from his apartment to work, we divide 10 miles by 2, which is 5 miles.
4) The distance from Anthony's apartment to the gym is 2 miles more than 5 miles, which is 7 miles.
