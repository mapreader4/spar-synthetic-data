Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sara bakes 10 cakes per day for 5 days
* So, the total number of cakes Sara bakes is 10 cakes per day x 5 days = 50 cakes
* Carol then eats 12 of the cakes
* So, the number of cakes remaining is 50 cakes - 12 cakes = 38 cakes
* It takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake
* Therefore, to frost the remaining 38 cakes, Bob needs 38 cakes x 2 cans of frosting per cake = 76 cans of frosting
