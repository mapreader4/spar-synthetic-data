Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Sally would have $80 if she had $20 less. This means that Sally currently has $100.
2) Jolly would have $70 if she had $20 more. This means that Jolly currently has $50.
3) To find the total amount of money that Sally and Jolly have altogether, we add their individual amounts:
Sally's money: $100
Jolly's money: $50
Total money: $100 + $50 = $150

Answer: 150
