Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rachel weighs 75 pounds
* Rachel weighs 6 pounds less than Jimmy
* So, Jimmy's weight is 75 + 6 = 81 pounds
* Rachel weighs 15 pounds more than Adam
* So, Adam's weight is 75 - 15 = 60 pounds

Now, to find the average weight of the three people, we add up their weights and divide by 3:
* (75 + 81 + 60) / 3 = 216 / 3 = 72

Answer: 72 pounds
