Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A notebook costs three times as much as a pen
* A pen costs $1.50
* So, a notebook must cost 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
* Lyle wants to buy 4 notebooks
* To calculate the total cost, we multiply the cost of one notebook ($4.50) by the number of notebooks (4)
* $4.50 x 4 = $18.00

Answer: $18.00
