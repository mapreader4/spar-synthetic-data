Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches for the 20 students in her class
* Each lunch bag included a pack of animal crackers with 10 animal crackers
* 2 students did not eat their animal crackers

First, we need to calculate the total number of animal crackers that were brought:
* 20 lunch bags x 10 animal crackers per pack = 200 animal crackers

Next, we need to subtract the number of animal crackers that were not eaten:
* 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, so 2 x 10 = 20 animal crackers were not eaten

Finally, we can calculate the total number of animal crackers that were eaten:
* 200 animal crackers - 20 animal crackers not eaten = 180 animal crackers eaten

Answer: 180
