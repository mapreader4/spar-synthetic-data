Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Irene shares half of a small apple with her dog every day
* A small apple weighs about 1/4 of a pound
* Irene and her dog consume 1/2 of a small apple per day
* In 1 day, they consume 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8 of a pound of apple
* In 2 weeks (14 days), they will consume 1/8 * 14 = 1.75 pounds of apple
* Apples cost $2.00 per pound
* To calculate the total cost:
* 1.75 pounds of apple * $2.00 per pound = $3.50

Answer: $3.50
