Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sab and Dane sold 6 pairs of shoes that cost $3 each.
   * 6 pairs of shoes x $3 per pair = $18 from the shoes.

2. Sab and Dane sold 18 shirts that cost $2 each.
   * 18 shirts x $2 per shirt = $36 from the shirts.

3. The total earnings from the shoes and shirts is:
   * $18 (from the shoes) + $36 (from the shirts) = $54 total.

4. Since Sab and Dane are dividing the total earnings, each of them will earn:
   * $54 total earnings / 2 people = $27 each.

Answer: 27
