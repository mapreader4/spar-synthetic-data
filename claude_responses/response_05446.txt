Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The building has 10 floors
* It takes 15 seconds to go up the stairs to the even-numbered floors
* It takes 9 seconds to go up the stairs to the odd-numbered floors
* This includes getting to the first floor

To get to the 10th floor, we need to go through the following floors:
* 1st floor (9 seconds)
* 3rd floor (9 seconds)
* 5th floor (9 seconds)
* 7th floor (9 seconds)
* 9th floor (9 seconds)
* 10th floor (15 seconds)

Adding up the time for each floor:
* 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 15 = 60 seconds

To convert to minutes:
* 60 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 1 minute

Answer: 1 minute
