Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tod drives 55 miles to the north
* Then he drives 95 miles to the west
* He drives at a constant speed of 25 miles per hour

To calculate the total distance traveled, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
* Distance = sqrt((55 miles)^2 + (95 miles)^2)
* Distance = sqrt(3,025 + 9,025)
* Distance = sqrt(12,050)
* Distance = 109.7 miles

Now, to calculate the total time it took Tod to drive this distance, we divide the total distance by his speed:
* Time = 109.7 miles / 25 miles per hour
* Time = 4.39 hours

Answer: 4 hours
