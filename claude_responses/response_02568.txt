Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The carton contains 12 eggs
* 5 of those eggs have double yolks
* For the 5 eggs with double yolks, there are 10 yolks (5 eggs x 2 yolks per egg)
* For the remaining 7 eggs with single yolks, there are 7 yolks
* To find the total number of yolks in the carton, we add the yolks from the double-yolk eggs and the single-yolk eggs:
* 10 yolks (from the double-yolk eggs) + 7 yolks (from the single-yolk eggs) = 17 yolks

Answer: 17
