Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Bertolli Farm grows 2073 tomatoes.
2) The Bertolli Farm grows 4112 cobs of corn.
3) The total number of tomatoes and corn grown is 2073 + 4112 = 6185.
4) The Bertolli Farm grows 985 onions.
5) To find how many fewer onions are grown than tomatoes and corn together, we subtract the number of onions from the total number of tomatoes and corn:
6185 - 985 = 5200.

Answer: 5200
