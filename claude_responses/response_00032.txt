Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The car travels through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns
* After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters
* After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters
* After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further
* At the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel
* The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring

To find the distance the car traveled after the 3rd turn, we can use the following equation:
Total distance traveled = Distance after 1st turn + Distance after 2nd turn + Distance after 3rd turn
23 meters = 5 meters + 8 meters + Distance after 3rd turn
Distance after 3rd turn = 23 meters - 5 meters - 8 meters
Distance after 3rd turn = 10 meters

Answer: 10 meters
