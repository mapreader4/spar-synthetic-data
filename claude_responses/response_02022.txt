To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days the 2-liter bottle of soda will last.

Given information:
- Dana normally drinks a 500 ml bottle of soda each day.
- The 2-liter bottle of soda contains 2,000 ml (2 liters Ã— 1,000 ml/liter).
- Dana continues to drink 500 ml of soda each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days the 2-liter bottle of soda will last.
Total volume of the 2-liter bottle of soda / Daily consumption of soda = Number of days the bottle will last
2,000 ml / 500 ml = 4 days

Therefore, the 2-liter bottle of soda will last 4 days.
