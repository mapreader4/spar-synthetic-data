Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* New York is two-thirds as populated as all of New England
* New England has a population of 2,100,000 people
* To find the population of New York, we need to take two-thirds of New England's population:
* Two-thirds of 2,100,000 = (2/3) * 2,100,000 = 1,400,000
* Therefore, the population of New York is 1,400,000 people
* To find the combined population of New York and New England, we add their individual populations:
* 2,100,000 (New England) + 1,400,000 (New York) = 3,500,000

Answer: 3,500,000
