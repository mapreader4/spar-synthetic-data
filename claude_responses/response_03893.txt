Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rocco has 4 piles of quarters, where each pile contains 10 quarters
* 4 piles x 10 quarters per pile = 40 quarters
* 40 quarters x $0.25 per quarter = $10.00 in quarters

* Rocco has 6 piles of dimes, where each pile contains 10 dimes
* 6 piles x 10 dimes per pile = 60 dimes
* 60 dimes x $0.10 per dime = $6.00 in dimes

* Rocco has 9 piles of nickels, where each pile contains 10 nickels
* 9 piles x 10 nickels per pile = 90 nickels
* 90 nickels x $0.05 per nickel = $4.50 in nickels

* Rocco has 5 piles of pennies, where each pile contains 10 pennies
* 5 piles x 10 pennies per pile = 50 pennies
* 50 pennies x $0.01 per penny = $0.50 in pennies

Now, to calculate the total amount of money Rocco has:
$10.00 (quarters) + $6.00 (dimes) + $4.50 (nickels) + $0.50 (pennies) = $21.00

Answer: $21.00
