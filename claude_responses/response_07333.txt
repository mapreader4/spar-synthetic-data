Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John has other Star Wars toys that cost $1000 in total.
2) The lightsaber toy is twice as expensive as all his other Star Wars toys combined.
3) To find the cost of the lightsaber toy, we take the cost of the other toys ($1000) and multiply it by 2.
4) $1000 x 2 = $2000
5) Therefore, the total amount of money John has spent is the cost of the other toys ($1000) plus the cost of the lightsaber toy ($2000).
6) $1000 + $2000 = $3000

Answer: $3000
