Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats.
2. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane.
3. Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats.
4. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.

Let's start with Wanda's information:
* Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread
* Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats
* So, the number of treats Wanda brings is 90 / 3 = 30 treats

Now, let's look at Jane's information:
* Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats
* So, if Wanda brings 30 treats, Jane brings 75% of 30, which is 0.75 * 30 = 22.5 treats
* Since Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, she brings 0.75 * 22.5 = 16.875 pieces of bread

Now, we can add up the total number of pieces of bread and treats that Wanda and Jane brought:
* Wanda brought 90 pieces of bread and 30 treats
* Jane brought 16.875 pieces of bread and 22.5 treats
* Total pieces of bread = 90 + 16.875 = 106.875
* Total treats = 30 + 22.5 = 52.5
* Total pieces of bread and treats = 106.875 + 52.5 = 159.375
