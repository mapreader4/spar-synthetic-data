Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Taipei 101 is 1,673 feet tall with 101 floors.
2) The first to 100th floors each have a height of 16.5 feet.
3) To find the height of the 101st floor, we need to subtract the total height of the first 100 floors from the total height of Taipei 101.
4) The total height of the first 100 floors is 100 * 16.5 = 1,650 feet.
5) The height of the 101st floor is the total height of Taipei 101 (1,673 feet) minus the total height of the first 100 floors (1,650 feet).
6) 1,673 feet - 1,650 feet = 23 feet.

Answer: 23 feet.
