Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Leticia's dish costs $10, Scarlett's dish costs $13, and Percy's dish costs $17.
2) The total cost of the three dishes is $10 + $13 + $17 = $40.
3) The tip is 10% of the total cost.
4) To calculate the tip, we take 10% of $40, which is 0.10 * $40 = $4.
Answer: $4
