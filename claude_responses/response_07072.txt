Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that in 5 years, Nacho will be three times older than Divya.
2) We are also given that Divya is currently 5 years old.
3) So in 5 years, Divya will be 5 + 5 = 10 years old.
4) Since Nacho will be three times older than Divya in 5 years, that means Nacho will be 3 * 10 = 30 years old in 5 years.
5) Therefore, Nacho's current age is 30 - 5 = 25 years old.
6) The sum of their ages now is Divya's current age (5) plus Nacho's current age (25).

Answer: 30
