Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The rancher has 8 sheep and 5 cattle
* Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month
* Each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month
* The pasture contains 144 acres of grass
* A bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months
* Feed corn costs $10 per bag

First, let's calculate how much grass the animals will consume per month:
* Cows: 5 cows x 2 acres/month = 10 acres/month
* Sheep: 8 sheep x 1 acre/month = 8 acres/month
* Total grass consumed per month = 10 + 8 = 18 acres/month

Now, let's calculate how long the pasture will last:
* Pasture contains 144 acres of grass
* Animals consume 18 acres/month
* 144 acres / 18 acres/month = 8 months

So, the pasture will last for 8 months. After that, the rancher will need to buy feed corn.

Next, let's calculate how much feed corn the rancher will need to buy:
* Cows: 5 cows x (12 months - 8 months) = 20 bags of feed corn
* Sheep: 8 sheep x (12 months - 8 months) / 2 = 8 bags of feed corn
* Total bags of feed corn needed = 20 + 8 = 28 bags

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the feed corn:
* 28 bags x $10/bag = $280

Answer: $280
