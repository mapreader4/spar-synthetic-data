Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each yogurt is topped with 8 banana slices
* One banana will yield 10 slices
* Vivian needs to make 5 yogurts

First, we need to find the total number of banana slices needed for 5 yogurts:
* 8 slices per yogurt x 5 yogurts = 40 banana slices

Next, we need to find how many bananas are required to get 40 banana slices:
* 1 banana yields 10 slices
* 40 slices / 10 slices per banana = 4 bananas

Therefore, Vivian needs to buy 4 bananas to make 5 yogurts.
