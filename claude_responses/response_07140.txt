Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marissa's sister is 4 feet 3 inches tall.
2) We need to convert 4 feet 3 inches to inches to work with the same unit.
3) 4 feet = 48 inches, and 3 inches = 3 inches.
4) So Marissa's sister is 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall.
5) Marissa's sunflower is 21 inches taller than her sister.
6) So the sunflower's height in inches is 51 + 21 = 72 inches.
7) To convert 72 inches to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot.
8) 72 inches / 12 inches per foot = 6 feet.

Answer: 6 feet.
