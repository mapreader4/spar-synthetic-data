Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roger had a 6-hour drive planned out
* He downloaded several podcasts to listen to during the drive
* The first podcast was 45 minutes long
* The second podcast was twice as long as the first, so it was 90 minutes long
* The third podcast was 1 hour and 45 minutes long
* The fourth podcast was 1 hour long

Now, let's calculate the total time of the first four podcasts:
* 45 minutes + 90 minutes + 105 minutes + 60 minutes = 300 minutes
* 300 minutes = 5 hours

So, the total time of the first four podcasts is 5 hours.

To fill up the full 6 hours, Roger will need an additional 1 hour of podcast.

Answer: 1 hour
