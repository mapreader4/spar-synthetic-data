Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lexi wants to run a total of three and one-fourth miles
* One lap on the outdoor track measures a quarter of a mile around
* To find the number of complete laps she must run, we need to divide the total distance she wants to run by the distance of one lap

First, let's convert the total distance of three and one-fourth miles to a decimal:
* 3.25 miles

Now, we divide the total distance by the distance of one lap:
* 3.25 miles / 0.25 miles per lap = 13 laps

Therefore, Lexi must run 13 complete laps on the outdoor track.

Answer: 13
