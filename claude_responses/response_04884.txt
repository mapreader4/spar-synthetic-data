Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The adoption fee for the puppy is $200
* James' friend agrees to pay 25% of the adoption fee
* To calculate the amount James' friend will pay:
    - 25% of $200 = 0.25 x $200 = $50
* Therefore, the amount James has to pay is the total adoption fee minus the amount his friend will pay:
    - $200 - $50 = $150

Answer: $150
