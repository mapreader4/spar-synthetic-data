Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Susie babysits for 3 hours a day at a rate of $10 per hour.
2) So, her daily earnings are 3 hours x $10 per hour = $30 per day.
3) She worked for 1 week, which is 7 days.
4) So, her total earnings for the week are 7 days x $30 per day = $210.
5) She spent 3/10 of her earnings on a make-up set.
6) 3/10 of $210 is 0.3 x $210 = $63.
7) She then spent 2/5 of her remaining money on skincare products.
8) The remaining money after the make-up set purchase is $210 - $63 = $147.
9) 2/5 of $147 is 0.4 x $147 = $58.80.
10) The amount left from her earnings last week is $147 - $58.80 = $88.20.

Answer: $88
