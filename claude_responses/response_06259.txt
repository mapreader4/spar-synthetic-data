Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John is half times younger than his father.
2) John's father is 40 years old.
3) Therefore, John's age is half of his father's age, which is 40/2 = 20 years old.
4) John's father is 4 years older than John's mother.
5) Therefore, John's mother's age is 40 - 4 = 36 years old.
6) The age difference between John and his mother is John's age (20 years) subtracted from his mother's age (36 years).

Answer: 16 years
