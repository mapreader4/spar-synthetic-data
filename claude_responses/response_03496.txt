Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farmer planted 30 rows of tomatoes
* Each row has 10 plants
* So the total number of tomato plants is 30 rows x 10 plants per row = 300 plants
* Each tomato plant yields 20 pieces of tomatoes
* To find the total number of tomatoes, we multiply the total number of plants (300) by the number of tomatoes per plant (20)
* 300 plants x 20 tomatoes per plant = 6,000 tomatoes

Answer: 6,000
