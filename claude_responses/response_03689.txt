Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Johnny has 3 colors of guitar picks: red, blue, and yellow
* Half of his picks are red
* One-third of his picks are blue
* The remaining picks are yellow
* We know that he has 12 blue picks

First, let's find the total number of picks he has:
* We know that one-third of his picks are blue, and he has 12 blue picks
* So, the total number of picks = 12 / (1/3) = 36 picks

Now, let's find the number of red picks:
* We know that half of his picks are red
* So, the number of red picks = 36 / 2 = 18 picks

Finally, we can find the number of yellow picks:
* We know the total number of picks is 36
* We know the number of red picks is 18
* We know the number of blue picks is 12
* So, the number of yellow picks = 36 - 18 - 12 = 6 picks

Answer: 6
