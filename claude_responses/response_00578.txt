Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bucky wants to save up $60 for a new video game
* Last weekend he earned $35
* This Sunday, he caught 5 fish
* 60% of the fish were trout, and the rest were blue-gill
* Trout earn $5 each, and blue-gill earn $4 each

First, let's calculate how much he earned this Sunday:
* 60% of 5 fish were trout, which is 3 trout
* 3 trout at $5 each is $15
* The remaining 2 fish were blue-gill, which at $4 each is $8
* Total earned this Sunday: $15 + $8 = $23

Now, let's add up his total earnings so far:
* Last weekend: $35
* This Sunday: $23
* Total earned so far: $35 + $23 = $58

Finally, we can calculate how much more he needs to save:
* Total cost of the video game: $60
* Total earned so far: $58
* Amount still needed to save: $60 - $58 = $2

Answer: $2
