Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom Sawyer needs 10 yellow tickets to win a new Bible
* He has 8 yellow tickets already
* So he needs 2 more yellow tickets (10 - 8 = 2)
* Each yellow ticket is obtained by trading in 10 red tickets
* He has 3 red tickets
* So he needs 7 more red tickets (2 yellow tickets x 10 red tickets per yellow ticket = 20 red tickets, and he has 3 already, so 20 - 3 = 17 more red tickets needed)
* Each red ticket is obtained by trading in 10 blue tickets
* He has 7 blue tickets
* So he needs 170 more blue tickets (17 red tickets x 10 blue tickets per red ticket = 170 blue tickets needed)

Answer: 170
