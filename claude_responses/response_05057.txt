Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 21 cherry tomatoes on the tomato plant.
* 2 birds eat one-third of the tomatoes.
* To find out how many tomatoes the birds ate, we need to calculate one-third of 21:
  * One-third of 21 is 21 / 3 = 7
* So the 2 birds ate 7 tomatoes.
* To find out how many tomatoes are still left on the tomato plant, we subtract the number of tomatoes eaten by the birds from the total number of tomatoes:
  * 21 - 7 = 14

Answer: 14
