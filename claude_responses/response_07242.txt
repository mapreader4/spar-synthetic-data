Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John drinks 1.5 gallons of water per day
* There are 4 quarts in 1 gallon
* So, 1.5 gallons per day is equivalent to 1.5 * 4 = 6 quarts per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* Therefore, the amount of quarts John drinks in a week is 6 quarts per day * 7 days per week = 42 quarts

Answer: 42
