Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. So if the first tank has 48 gallons, the second tank has 24 gallons (48 / 2 = 24).
2) The rule is one gallon of water per inch of fish.
3) In the first tank, the fish are 3 inches long. So the first tank can hold 48 / 3 = 16 fish.
4) In the second tank, the fish are 2 inches long. So the second tank can hold 24 / 2 = 12 fish.
5) Initially, Gail has 16 fish in the first tank and 12 fish in the second tank.
6) If one of the first tank fish eats another, then Gail will have 15 fish in the first tank.
7) The difference between the number of fish in the first tank and the second tank is 15 - 12 = 3.
