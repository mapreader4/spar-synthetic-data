Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, James eats:
  - 1/4 pound of asparagus per day
  - 1/4 pound of broccoli per day
* So, in 1 week (7 days), he eats:
  - 1/4 pound x 7 days = 1.75 pounds of asparagus
  - 1/4 pound x 7 days = 1.75 pounds of broccoli
  - Total: 1.75 + 1.75 = 3.5 pounds of vegetables per week
* After 2 weeks, he doubles the amount of asparagus and broccoli:
  - 1/2 pound of asparagus per day
  - 1/2 pound of broccoli per day
* So, in 1 week (7 days), he eats:
  - 1/2 pound x 7 days = 3.5 pounds of asparagus
  - 1/2 pound x 7 days = 3.5 pounds of broccoli
  - Total: 3.5 + 3.5 = 7 pounds of vegetables per week
* He also adds 3 pounds of kale per week
* So, the total amount of vegetables he eats per week is:
  - 7 pounds (asparagus and broccoli) + 3 pounds (kale) = 10 pounds

Answer: 10 pounds
