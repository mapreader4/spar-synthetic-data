Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that Sara and Joe have a combined height of 120 inches.
2) We are also given that Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height.
3) Let's call Sara's height "x" inches.
4) Then Joe's height is 2x + 6 inches.
5) We know that the combined height of Sara and Joe is 120 inches, so we can write the equation:
x + (2x + 6) = 120
6) Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 6 = 120
7) Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:
3x = 114
8) Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 38
9) So Sara's height is 38 inches.
10) Now we can calculate Joe's height:
Joe's height = 2x + 6 = 2(38) + 6 = 82 inches.

Answer: 82
