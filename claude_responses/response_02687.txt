Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The forest initially has 30 native trees.
2) On Monday, the forester triples the total number of trees in the forest by planting new trees.
   * The initial 30 trees plus the new trees planted on Monday equals 3 times 30, which is 90 trees.
   * So the forester planted 60 new trees on Monday (90 - 30 = 60).
3) On Tuesday, the forester plants a third of the amount he planted on Monday.
   * A third of 60 is 20.
   * So the forester planted 20 new trees on Tuesday.
4) To calculate the total number of trees planted, we add the number of trees planted on Monday and Tuesday.
   * 60 trees planted on Monday + 20 trees planted on Tuesday = 80 trees planted in total.

Answer: 80
