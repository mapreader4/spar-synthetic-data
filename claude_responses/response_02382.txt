Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tanya buys:
   - 2 face moisturizers at $50 each = $100
   - 4 body lotions at $60 each = $240
   - Total spent by Tanya = $100 + $240 = $340

2. Christy spends twice as much as Tanya, so:
   - Christy's total spending = 2 x $340 = $680

3. To find the total amount spent by Christy and Tanya together:
   - Total amount spent = Tanya's spending + Christy's spending
   - Total amount spent = $340 + $680 = $1,020

Answer: $1,020
