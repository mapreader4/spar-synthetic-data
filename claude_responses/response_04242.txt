Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Aston has 150 pages that he found on the floor.
2) Each comic has 25 pages.
3) To find the number of comics that the 150 pages make up, we divide 150 by 25:
150 / 25 = 6 comics
4) There were already 5 untorn comics in the box.
5) So the total number of comics in the box is 6 (the torn comics) + 5 (the untorn comics) = 11 comics.

Answer: 11
