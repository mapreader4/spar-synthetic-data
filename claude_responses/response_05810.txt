Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 64 seventh graders, and this is 32% of the students at the school.
2) To find the total number of students at the school, we can divide the number of seventh graders (64) by the percentage they represent (32%):
   * Total students = 64 / 0.32 = 200 students
3) Now we know that the sixth graders comprise 38% of the students.
4) To find the number of sixth graders, we can multiply the total number of students (200) by the percentage of sixth graders (38%):
   * Number of sixth graders = 200 * 0.38 = 76 students

Answer: 76
