Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) A standard deck of playing cards has 52 cards.
2) The face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and the 8's are removed, leaving 40 cards in the deck.
3) Of the remaining 40 cards, 20 are red (10 hearts, 10 diamonds).
4) Of the 20 red cards, 6 have a number divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9).
5) Mark picks a card at random and then replaces it 36 times.
6) The probability of picking a red card with a number divisible by 3 is 6/40 = 0.15.
7) The expected number of times Mark will pick a red card with a number divisible by 3 is 36 * 0.15 = 5.4.
