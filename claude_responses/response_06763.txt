Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John has 20% more boxes than Jules.
2) Jules has 5 more boxes than Joseph.
3) Joseph has 80% fewer boxes than Stan.
4) Stan has 100 boxes.

First, let's find how many boxes Joseph has:
* Stan has 100 boxes
* Joseph has 80% fewer boxes than Stan
* 80% of 100 is 80
* Therefore, Joseph has 100 - 80 = 20 boxes

Next, let's find how many boxes Jules has:
* Jules has 5 more boxes than Joseph
* Joseph has 20 boxes
* Therefore, Jules has 20 + 5 = 25 boxes

Finally, let's find how many boxes John has:
* John has 20% more boxes than Jules
* Jules has 25 boxes
* 20% of 25 is 5
* Therefore, John has 25 + 5 = 30 boxes

Answer: 30
