Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The field is a rectangle with a length of 100 m and a width of 50 m.
2) The players are asked to do 6 laps of the field.
3) To find the distance each player will run, we need to find the perimeter of the field and multiply it by the number of laps.
4) The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.
5) The perimeter of this field is 2 * 100 m + 2 * 50 m = 300 m.
6) Since the players are asked to do 6 laps, the total distance each player will run is 6 * 300 m = 1,800 m.

Answer: 1,800
