Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Faye had $20 initially.
2) Her mother gave her twice as much as her money, which is 2 x $20 = $40.
3) So, Faye now has $20 + $40 = $60.
4) She bought 10 cupcakes at $1.50 each, so that's 10 x $1.50 = $15.
5) She also bought 5 boxes of cookies at $3 per box, so that's 5 x $3 = $15.
6) In total, she spent $15 + $15 = $30.
7) She started with $60 and spent $30, so the amount of money she has left is $60 - $30 = $30.

Answer: $30
