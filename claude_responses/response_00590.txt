Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The total number of chocolate bars in the box is 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100 bars.
2) To calculate the percentage of each type of chocolate bar, we need to divide the number of each type by the total number of bars and then multiply by 100.
3) Milk chocolate bars: 25 / 100 = 0.25 or 25%
4) Dark chocolate bars: 25 / 100 = 0.25 or 25%
5) Milk chocolate with almond bars: 25 / 100 = 0.25 or 25%
6) White chocolate bars: 25 / 100 = 0.25 or 25%

Answer: 25%
