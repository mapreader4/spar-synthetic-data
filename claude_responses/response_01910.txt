Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Johnson's cornfield:
   - Johnson owns 1 hectare of land
   - His cornfield can yield 80 corn every 2 months
   - In 6 months, Johnson's cornfield can yield 80 corn x 3 (since 6 months = 3 periods of 2 months) = 240 corn

2. Neighbor's cornfield:
   - Neighbor owns 2 hectares of land
   - Each hectare can yield twice the amount as Johnson's, which is 80 x 2 = 160 corn every 2 months
   - In 6 months, Neighbor's cornfield can yield 160 corn x 3 (since 6 months = 3 periods of 2 months) = 480 corn

3. Total corn harvested:
   - Johnson's cornfield: 240 corn
   - Neighbor's cornfield: 480 corn
   - Total corn harvested = 240 + 480 = 720 corn

Answer: 720
