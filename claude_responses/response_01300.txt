* He then spends four times that long trying to get off the freeway
* To calculate the time spent trying to get off the freeway:
  - 2 hours x 4 = 8 hours
* To calculate the total time wasted:
  - Time spent waiting in traffic: 2 hours
  - Time spent trying to get off the freeway: 8 hours
  - Total time wasted: 2 hours + 8 hours = 10 hours
