Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago, so his current age is 32 + 5 = 37 years old.
2) 7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age. 
3) 7 years ago, Tom's age was 37 - 7 = 30 years old.
4) Half of Tom's age 7 years ago was 30 / 2 = 15 years old.
5) Jim was 5 years older than 15 years old, so Jim was 15 + 5 = 20 years old 7 years ago.
6) Therefore, Jim's current age is 20 + 7 = 27 years old.
7) In 2 years, Jim will be 27 + 2 = 29 years old.

Answer: 29
