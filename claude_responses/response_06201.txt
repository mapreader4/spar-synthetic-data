Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of comic books in the store: 300
* 30% of the comic books are liked by females
* Males like 120 comic books
* The rest of the comic books are disliked by both males and females

First, let's calculate the number of comic books liked by females:
* 30% of 300 = 0.3 * 300 = 90 comic books

Now, we know that males like 120 comic books. We can subtract this from the total to find the number of comic books disliked by both males and females:
* 300 - 90 - 120 = 90 comic books

To find the percentage of comic books disliked by both males and females, we divide the number of disliked comic books by the total number of comic books:
* 90 / 300 = 0.3 = 30%

Answer: 30%
