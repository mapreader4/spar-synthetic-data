Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The marching band has a total of 110 members.
2) There are 4 times as many percussion players as there are woodwind players.
3) There are twice as many woodwind players as there are brass players.
4) Let's represent the number of brass players as x.
5) Since there are twice as many woodwind players as brass players, the number of woodwind players is 2x.
6) Since there are 4 times as many percussion players as woodwind players, the number of percussion players is 4 * 2x = 8x.
7) The total number of members in the marching band is 110, which is the sum of the brass, woodwind, and percussion players:
x + 2x + 8x = 110
11x = 110
x = 10
Answer: 10
