Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Noa scored 30 points to win the bowl
* Phillip scored twice the number of points that Noa scored
* To find Phillip's score, we take Noa's score and multiply it by 2:
  * Phillip's score = 30 x 2 = 60 points
* To find the total number of points Tom and Phillip scored, we add Noa's score and Phillip's score:
  * Total points = Noa's score + Phillip's score
  * Total points = 30 + 60 = 90 points

Answer: 90
