Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each loaf of bread was sliced into 15 pieces.
2) The 10 friends bought 4 loaves of bread.
3) To find the total number of slices of bread, we multiply the number of loaves (4) by the number of slices per loaf (15):
4 loaves x 15 slices per loaf = 60 total slices of bread.
4) Since the 10 friends ate all 60 slices of bread equally, we divide the total number of slices (60) by the number of friends (10) to get the number of slices each friend ate:
60 slices / 10 friends = 6 slices per friend.
