Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Belinda made 200 flyers to distribute around town.
2) Ryan passed out 42 flyers, Alyssa passed out 67 flyers, and Scott passed out 51 flyers.
3) To find the number of flyers Belinda passed out, we need to subtract the number of flyers passed out by her friends from the total number of flyers:
   * Total flyers: 200
   * Flyers passed out by Ryan: 42
   * Flyers passed out by Alyssa: 67
   * Flyers passed out by Scott: 51
   * Flyers passed out by Belinda = 200 - 42 - 67 - 51 = 40
4) To find the percentage of flyers Belinda passed out, we divide the number of flyers she passed out by the total number of flyers and multiply by 100:
   * Percentage of flyers Belinda passed out = (40 / 200) * 100 = 20%

Answer: 20
