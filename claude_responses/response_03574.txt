Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sally wants 1/4 of the cookies to have nuts in them
* 1/4 of 60 cookies = 15 cookies with nuts
* Sally wants 40% of the cookies to have chocolate chips in them
* 40% of 60 cookies = 24 cookies with chocolate chips
* The remaining cookies will have both nuts and chocolate chips
* 60 cookies - 15 cookies with nuts - 24 cookies with chocolate chips = 21 cookies with both nuts and chocolate chips
* For the 15 cookies with just nuts, she needs 2 nuts per cookie, so 15 cookies x 2 nuts = 30 nuts
* For the 21 cookies with both nuts and chocolate chips, she needs 2 nuts per cookie, so 21 cookies x 2 nuts = 42 nuts
* In total, she needs 30 nuts + 42 nuts = 72 nuts

Answer: 72
