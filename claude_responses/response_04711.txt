Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The textbook has 31 chapters
* Anna skips all the chapters that are divisible by 3
* It takes her 20 minutes to read each chapter

To find the total number of chapters she reads, we need to subtract the number of chapters that are divisible by 3 from the total number of chapters.
* Chapters divisible by 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30
* That's 10 chapters that she skips

So, the number of chapters she reads is:
* 31 - 10 = 21 chapters

Now, we know it takes her 20 minutes to read each chapter, so the total time spent reading is:
* 21 chapters x 20 minutes/chapter = 420 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes/hour:
* 420 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 7 hours

Answer: 7 hours
