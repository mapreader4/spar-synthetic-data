Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emery's family drives the first 100 miles in 1 hour.
2) They then stop at a McDonald's, so we don't know how long that stop took.
3) They then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles.
4) To calculate the total time traveled, we need to find the time it took to drive the remaining 300 miles.
5) We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, so we can assume they drove at a rate of 100 miles per hour.
6) Therefore, to drive the remaining 300 miles at the same rate, it would take 3 hours (300 miles / 100 miles per hour = 3 hours).
7) Adding the initial 1 hour of driving and the 3 hours for the remaining 300 miles, the total time traveled is 4 hours.

Answer: 4 hours
