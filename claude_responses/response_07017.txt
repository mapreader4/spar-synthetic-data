Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Oaklyn buys handmade rugs at $40 each
* She bought 20 rugs
* So the total cost of the 20 rugs is:
    * 20 rugs x $40 per rug = $800
* She sells the rugs at $60 each
* So the total revenue from selling the 20 rugs is:
    * 20 rugs x $60 per rug = $1,200
* To calculate the profit, we take the total revenue and subtract the total cost:
    * $1,200 (total revenue) - $800 (total cost) = $400

Answer: $400
