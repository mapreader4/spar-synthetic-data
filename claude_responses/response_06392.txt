Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First bill:
   - Amount: $200
   - Interest rate: 10% simple interest per month
   - Overdue: 2 months
   - Interest owed = $200 * 0.10 * 2 = $40
   - Total owed for first bill = $200 + $40 = $240

2. Second bill:
   - Amount: $130
   - Late fee: $50 per month
   - Overdue: 6 months
   - Late fees owed = $50 * 6 = $300
   - Total owed for second bill = $130 + $300 = $430

3. Third bill:
   - Amount: $444
   - First month late fee: $40
   - Second month late fee: $80 (2 * $40)
   - Overdue: 2 months
   - Total late fees owed = $40 + $80 = $120
   - Total owed for third bill = $444 + $120 = $564

4. Total amount owed:
   - First bill: $240
   - Second bill: $430
   - Third bill: $564
   - Total owed = $240 + $430 + $564 = $1,234

Answer: $1,234
