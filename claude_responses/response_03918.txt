Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jesse read the first 5 chapters, which were 10, 15, 27, 12, and 19 pages respectively.
2) The total number of pages he read is 10 + 15 + 27 + 12 + 19 = 83 pages.
3) He found that he was only 1/3 of the way through the book.
4) This means that the total number of pages in the book is 3 times the number of pages he has read so far, which is 3 * 83 = 249 pages.
5) To find how many pages he still has to read, we subtract the number of pages he has already read (83) from the total number of pages in the book (249).
6) 249 - 83 = 166 pages.

Answer: 166
