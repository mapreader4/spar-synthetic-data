Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) John initially weighs 220 pounds.
2) He loses 10% of his body weight. 10% of 220 pounds is 0.10 * 220 = 22 pounds.
3) So, after losing 22 pounds, John's weight is 220 - 22 = 198 pounds.
4) John then gains back 2 pounds, so his final weight is 198 + 2 = 200 pounds.

Answer: 200 pounds.
