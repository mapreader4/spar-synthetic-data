Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given a triangle with angles A, B, and C.
2) The angle A is 60 degrees.
3) The angle B is two times as big as the angle C.
4) We need to calculate the angle of B.
5) Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write:
A + B + C = 180
6) Substituting the given information, we get:
60 + B + C = 180
7) We know that B = 2C, so we can substitute this in:
60 + 2C + C = 180
8) Simplifying, we get:
60 + 3C = 180
9) Solving for C, we get:
3C = 120
C = 40
10) Since B = 2C, we can calculate B:
B = 2 * 40 = 80
Answer: 80 degrees.
