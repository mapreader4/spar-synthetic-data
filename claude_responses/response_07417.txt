Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Max fills up water balloons for 30 minutes at a rate of 2 water balloons every minute.
   * Max's total number of water balloons filled = 2 balloons/minute x 30 minutes = 60 balloons

2. Zach fills up water balloons for 40 minutes at a rate of 3 water balloons every minute.
   * Zach's total number of water balloons filled = 3 balloons/minute x 40 minutes = 120 balloons

3. In the process, 10 of the water balloons pop on the ground.
   * Total number of water balloons filled = Max's balloons + Zach's balloons - popped balloons
   * Total number of water balloons filled = 60 + 120 - 10 = 170 balloons

Answer: 170
