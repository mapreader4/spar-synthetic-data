Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The total length of the rope is 40 meters.
2) The rope was cut into 2 parts in the ratio of 2:3.
3) This means the shorter part is 2 parts, and the longer part is 3 parts.
4) To find the length of the shorter part, we need to find the total number of parts (2 + 3 = 5) and then calculate the length of each part.
5) The length of each part is 40 meters / 5 parts = 8 meters.
6) The shorter part is 2 parts, so the length of the shorter part is 2 * 8 meters = 16 meters.

Answer: 16 meters.
