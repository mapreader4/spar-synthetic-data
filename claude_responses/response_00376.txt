Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb.
2) Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla.
3) Kayla picked 20 apples.
4) So, Caleb picked 20 - 5 = 15 apples.
5) Suraya picked 12 more apples than Caleb, so Suraya picked 15 + 12 = 27 apples.
6) Suraya picked 27 apples and Kayla picked 20 apples.
7) Therefore, Suraya picked 27 - 20 = 7 more apples than Kayla.
