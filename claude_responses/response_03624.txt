Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The truck can go 3 miles per gallon of gas.
2) The distance to the cheaper gas station is 90 miles.
3) The truck driver already has 12 gallons of gas in his tank.
4) To calculate the number of gallons needed to travel 90 miles, we divide the distance by the miles per gallon:
90 miles / 3 miles per gallon = 30 gallons
5) Since the truck driver already has 12 gallons in the tank, we subtract that from the 30 gallons needed:
30 gallons - 12 gallons = 18 gallons
Answer: 18 gallons
