Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Haley can hold 8 marshmallows in her mouth
* Michael can hold 3 times as many marshmallows as Haley
* To calculate how many marshmallows Michael can hold:
  * Haley can hold 8 marshmallows
  * Michael can hold 3 times as many, so 3 x 8 = 24 marshmallows
* Brandon can hold half as many marshmallows as Michael
* To calculate how many marshmallows Brandon can hold:
  * Michael can hold 24 marshmallows
  * Brandon can hold half as many, so 24 / 2 = 12 marshmallows

Now, to calculate the total number of marshmallows held by all three kids:
* Haley: 8 marshmallows
* Michael: 24 marshmallows
* Brandon: 12 marshmallows
* Total: 8 + 24 + 12 = 44 marshmallows

Answer: 44
