Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Phone repair costs $11 per repair
* They performed 5 phone repairs
* So, the total earnings from phone repairs is 5 * $11 = $55

* Laptop repair costs $15 per repair
* They performed 2 laptop repairs
* So, the total earnings from laptop repairs is 2 * $15 = $30

* Computer repair costs $18 per repair
* They performed 2 computer repairs
* So, the total earnings from computer repairs is 2 * $18 = $36

Now, to calculate the total earnings for the week, we add up the earnings from each type of repair:
* Total earnings = $55 + $30 + $36 = $121

Answer: 121
