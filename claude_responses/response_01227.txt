Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Francine has 5 full boxes of crayons, and each full box contains an unknown number of crayons.
2) Francine also has 5 loose crayons.
3) Francine's friend has 27 loose crayons.
4) In total, Francine has 85 crayons.
5) To find the number of crayons in each full box, we can subtract the 5 loose crayons from the total 85 crayons, which gives us 80 crayons in the 5 full boxes.
6) Since each full box contains the same number of crayons, we can divide 80 by 5 to get the number of crayons in each full box, which is 16.
7) Now we have 5 full boxes of 16 crayons each, plus 5 loose crayons from Francine, and 27 loose crayons from her friend, for a total of 32 loose crayons.
8) Each box can hold 16 crayons, so to hold the 32 loose crayons, they will need 2 more boxes.
