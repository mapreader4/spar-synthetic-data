Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Zoe ate 12 strawberries
* Each strawberry has 4 calories
* So the total calories from the strawberries is 12 * 4 = 48 calories
* Zoe also ate 6 ounces of yogurt
* Each ounce of yogurt has 17 calories
* So the total calories from the yogurt is 6 * 17 = 102 calories
* To find the total calories Zoe ate, we add the calories from the strawberries and the yogurt:
* 48 calories + 102 calories = 150 calories

Answer: 150
