Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The middle school sold 6 more than two times the number of fair tickets as it did tickets to the baseball game.
* This means that the number of baseball game tickets sold is equal to two times the number of fair tickets sold, minus 6.
* We are told that 25 fair tickets were sold.
* So, the number of baseball game tickets sold is equal to 2 x 25 - 6 = 50 - 6 = 44.

Answer: 44
