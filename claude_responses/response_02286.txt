Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marta has collected a total of $240 so far
* She receives $10 for every hour she works
* She has also collected $50 in tips
* To find the number of hours she has worked, we need to subtract the tips ($50) from the total amount collected ($240) to get the amount she has earned from working
* $240 - $50 = $190
* Since she earns $10 per hour, we can divide the amount she has earned from working ($190) by $10 to get the number of hours she has worked
* $190 / $10 = 19 hours

Answer: 19 hours
