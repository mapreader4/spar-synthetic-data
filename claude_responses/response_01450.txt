Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Caroline starts with 40 pairs of socks.
2) She loses 4 pairs of socks at the laundromat, so she now has 40 - 4 = 36 pairs of socks.
3) She donates two-thirds of the remaining 36 pairs of socks to the thrift store. Two-thirds of 36 is 24, so she donates 24 pairs of socks and keeps 36 - 24 = 12 pairs of socks.
4) She then purchases 10 new pairs of socks, so she now has 12 + 10 = 22 pairs of socks.
5) Finally, she receives 3 new pairs of socks as a gift from her dad, so she now has 22 + 3 = 25 pairs of socks in total.

Answer: 25
