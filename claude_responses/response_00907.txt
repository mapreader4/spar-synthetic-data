Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The store received a total of 20 pallets of paper products
* Half of the pallets were paper towels, which means 20 / 2 = 10 pallets of paper towels
* A quarter of the pallets were tissues, which means 20 / 4 = 5 pallets of tissues
* A fifth of the pallets were paper plates, which means 20 / 5 = 4 pallets of paper plates
* The remaining pallets must be paper cups
* To calculate the number of paper cup pallets, we take the total pallets (20) and subtract the pallets of paper towels (10), tissues (5), and paper plates (4)
* 20 - 10 - 5 - 4 = 1 pallet of paper cups
