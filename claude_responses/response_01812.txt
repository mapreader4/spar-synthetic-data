Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bret takes a 9-hour train ride to Boston
* He spends 2 hours reading a book
* He spends 1 hour eating his dinner
* He spends 3 hours watching movies on his computer
* To find the time he has left to take a nap, we need to add up the time he spent on other activities and subtract that from the total 9-hour train ride

Time spent on other activities:
* Reading a book: 2 hours
* Eating dinner: 1 hour
* Watching movies: 3 hours
* Total time spent on other activities: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 hours

Now, we subtract the 6 hours spent on other activities from the total 9-hour train ride:
* 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Bret has 3 hours left to take a nap.
