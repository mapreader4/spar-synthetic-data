Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The train has 3 red boxcars, 4 blue boxcars, and 7 black boxcars.
2. The black boxcars can each hold 4000 pounds of coal.
3. The blue boxcars can hold twice as much as the black boxcars, so each blue boxcar can hold 8000 pounds of coal.
4. The red boxcars can hold 3 times as much as the blue boxcars, so each red boxcar can hold 24,000 pounds of coal.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of all the boxcars:
* Black boxcars: 7 boxcars x 4000 pounds = 28,000 pounds
* Blue boxcars: 4 boxcars x 8000 pounds = 32,000 pounds
* Red boxcars: 3 boxcars x 24,000 pounds = 72,000 pounds

Adding these together, we get:
* Total capacity = 28,000 + 32,000 + 72,000 = 132,000 pounds of coal

Answer: 132,000 pounds
