Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Candice needs 2 loaves of white bread at $3.50 each
* So the cost of the white bread is 2 x $3.50 = $7.00
* She also needs 1 baguette that costs $1.50
* And she needs 2 loaves of sourdough bread at $4.50 each
* So the cost of the sourdough bread is 2 x $4.50 = $9.00
* She also treats herself to a $2.00 almond croissant each visit
* She visits the bakery 4 times over 4 weeks
* So the total cost of the almond croissants is 4 x $2.00 = $8.00
* Now we add up all the costs:
* $7.00 + $1.50 + $9.00 + $8.00 = $25.50
