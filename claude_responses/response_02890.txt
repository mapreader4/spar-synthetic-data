Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kyle has $12 less than 3 times what Dave has.
   * Dave has $46
   * 3 times $46 is $138
   * $138 - $12 = $126
   * So, Kyle has $126
2) Kyle then spends a third of his money going snowboarding.
   * A third of $126 is $42
   * $126 - $42 = $84
   * Therefore, Kyle has $84 remaining.

Answer: $84
