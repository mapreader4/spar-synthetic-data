Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Washington has 140 goats.
2) Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington.
3) To find the number of goats Paddington has, we add 40 to Washington's 140 goats:
   Paddington's goats = Washington's goats + 40
   Paddington's goats = 140 + 40 = 180 goats.
4) To find the total number of goats, we add Washington's and Paddington's goats together:
   Total goats = Washington's goats + Paddington's goats
   Total goats = 140 + 180 = 320 goats.

Answer: 320
