Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom charges $100 per day for the first 5 days
* After the first 5 days, he charges $60 per day
* The total number of days he looked for the item is 10 days

For the first 5 days:
* 5 days x $100 per day = $500

For the remaining 5 days:
* 5 days x $60 per day = $300

The total cost is the sum of the two:
* $500 + $300 = $800

Answer: 800
