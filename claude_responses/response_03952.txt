Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Luis is driving 80 miles in 2 hours.
2) This means that his speed is 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour.
3) We want to know how far he will go in 15 minutes.
4) 15 minutes is 1/4 of an hour.
5) So in 15 minutes, he will travel 1/4 of the distance he would travel in 1 hour.
6) 1/4 of 40 miles per hour is 10 miles.

Answer: 10 miles
