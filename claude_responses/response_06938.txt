Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The train starts with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars
* The distance between each station is 6 miles
* It takes 25 minutes to travel between each station
* At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car

To calculate the total time it will take to deliver all the cars, we need to determine how many stations the train will need to visit.

The maximum number of cars the train can drop off at each station is:
* 2 coal cars
* 3 iron cars
* 1 wood car

So, the total number of cars the train can drop off at each station is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 cars.

Now, we can calculate how many stations the train needs to visit to deliver all the cars:
* Initial number of cars: 6 + 12 + 2 = 20 cars
* Cars dropped off per station: 6 cars
* Number of stations needed: 20 cars / 6 cars per station = 3.33 stations

Since we can't have a fractional number of stations, we round up to 4 stations.

Therefore, the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is:
* 4 stations x 25 minutes per station = 100 minutes

Answer: 100
