Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) For the first artifact, James spends 6 months researching before going on a 2-year-long expedition.
2) So the total time for the first artifact is 6 months + 2 years = 2.5 years.
3) For the second artifact, the research and discovery time is 3 times as long as the first.
4) So the total time for the second artifact is 3 * 2.5 years = 7.5 years.
5) To find the total time for both artifacts, we add the time for the first and second artifacts:
2.5 years + 7.5 years = 10 years.
