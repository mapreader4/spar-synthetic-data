Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim's website got 100 visitors a day for the first 6 days
* On the last day of the week, it got twice as many visitors as every other day combined
* He gets $0.01 per visit

First, let's calculate the total number of visitors for the first 6 days:
* 100 visitors per day x 6 days = 600 visitors

Now, let's calculate the number of visitors on the last day:
* Every other day had 100 visitors each, so 100 x 6 = 600 visitors
* On the last day, it got twice as many visitors as 600, so 600 x 2 = 1,200 visitors

Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors for the week:
* 600 visitors (first 6 days) + 1,200 visitors (last day) = 1,800 visitors

Finally, let's calculate how much he made that week:
* 1,800 visitors x $0.01 per visit = $18.00

Answer: $18.00
