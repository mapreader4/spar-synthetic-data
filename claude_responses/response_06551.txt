Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The new computer is worth $80.
2) Troy has initially saved $50.
3) Troy plans to sell his old computer for $20.
4) To calculate how much more money Troy needs, we need to add the amount he has saved ($50) and the amount he will get from selling his old computer ($20), and then subtract that from the cost of the new computer ($80).
5) $50 + $20 = $70
6) $80 - $70 = $10

Answer: $10
