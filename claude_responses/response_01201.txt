Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Twice Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts. This means that if we know Betty's age, we can calculate the cost of a pack of nuts.
2) Doug, Betty's friend, is 40 years old. The sum of their ages is 90.
3) Let's call Betty's age x. Then Doug's age is 90 - x.
4) We know that Doug is 40 years old, so 90 - x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 50.
5) Since twice Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts, and Betty's age is 50, the cost of a pack of nuts is 2 * 50 = 100.
6) Betty wants to buy 20 packs of nuts, so the total amount she'll pay is 20 * 100 = 2000.

Answer: 2000
