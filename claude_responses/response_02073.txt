Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Alex had 36 ounces of jelly beans initially.
2) He ate 6 ounces, so he has 36 - 6 = 30 ounces remaining.
3) He divided the remaining 30 ounces equally into 3 piles.
4) To find the weight of each pile, we divide the total remaining ounces (30) by the number of piles (3).
5) 30 ounces / 3 piles = 10 ounces per pile.

Answer: 10 ounces
