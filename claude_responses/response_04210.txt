Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The gala luncheon planning committee has 24 people
* Each person on the committee should have 2 sandwiches each
* So the total number of sandwiches needed is 24 people * 2 sandwiches = 48 sandwiches
* The bakery offers 12 mini croissants for $8.00
* To calculate the number of packages of croissants needed, we divide the total number of sandwiches (48) by the number of croissants per package (12):
48 sandwiches / 12 croissants per package = 4 packages of croissants
* Each package of croissants costs $8.00
* So the total cost for 4 packages of croissants will be 4 * $8.00 = $32.00

Answer: $32.00
