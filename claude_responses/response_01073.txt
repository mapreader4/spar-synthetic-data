Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 1,800 fish swim westward
* 3,200 fish swim eastward
* 500 fish swim north
* Fishers catch 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward
* Fishers catch 3/4 of the fish that swam westward

First, let's calculate how many fish were caught:
* Eastward fish caught: 2/5 of 3,200 = 1,280 fish
* Westward fish caught: 3/4 of 1,800 = 1,350 fish

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish that were caught:
* Total fish caught = 1,280 + 1,350 = 2,630 fish

Finally, let's calculate the number of fish left in the sea:
* Total fish = 1,800 + 3,200 + 500 = 5,500 fish
* Fish left in the sea = 5,500 - 2,630 = 2,870 fish

Answer: 2,870
