Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* On the first day, Joey needs to take 1 pill.
* On the second day, he needs to take 2 more pills than the previous day, so he takes 1 + 2 = 3 pills.
* On the third day, he needs to take 2 more pills than the previous day, so he takes 3 + 2 = 5 pills.
* On the fourth day, he needs to take 2 more pills than the previous day, so he takes 5 + 2 = 7 pills.
* On the fifth day, he needs to take 2 more pills than the previous day, so he takes 7 + 2 = 9 pills.
* On the sixth day, he needs to take 2 more pills than the previous day, so he takes 9 + 2 = 11 pills.
* On the seventh day, he needs to take 2 more pills than the previous day, so he takes 11 + 2 = 13 pills.
* To calculate the total number of pills he will take in a week, we add up the number of pills for each day:
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 49

Answer: 49
