Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Tampa Bay Bucs initially have 13 football players and 16 cheerleaders.
* 10 football players and 4 cheerleaders quit.
* To find the number of football players and cheerleaders left, we need to subtract the number of players and cheerleaders who quit from the initial numbers.

For the football players:
* Initial number of football players: 13
* Number of football players who quit: 10
* Number of football players left = 13 - 10 = 3

For the cheerleaders:
* Initial number of cheerleaders: 16
* Number of cheerleaders who quit: 4
* Number of cheerleaders left = 16 - 4 = 12

Answer: 3 football players and 12 cheerleaders are left.
