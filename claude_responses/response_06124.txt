Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* One dress requires 5.5 yards of fabric
* Amare needs to make 4 dresses for the wedding
* So, the total amount of fabric needed for the 4 dresses is:
  * 4 dresses x 5.5 yards per dress = 22 yards of fabric
* Amare has 7 feet of fabric
* To convert 22 yards to feet, we multiply by 3 (since 1 yard = 3 feet):
  * 22 yards x 3 feet/yard = 66 feet of fabric
* So, the amount of fabric Amare still needs is:
  * 66 feet - 7 feet = 59 feet

Answer: 59
