Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ali sold 4 flowers on Monday
* He sold 8 flowers on Tuesday
* On Friday, he sold double the number of flowers he sold on Monday
* To find the number of flowers he sold on Friday, we take the number of flowers he sold on Monday (4) and double it, which is 4 x 2 = 8 flowers

Now, to find the total number of flowers Ali sold, we add up the number of flowers he sold on each day:
* Monday: 4 flowers
* Tuesday: 8 flowers
* Friday: 8 flowers

Adding these up, we get:
4 + 8 + 8 = 20 flowers

Answer: 20
