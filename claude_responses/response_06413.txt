Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 3 years ago, there were 200 students who passed the English course.
* Each subsequent year, the number of students who passed increased by 50% of the previous year's number.

To calculate the number of students who will pass the course this year, we need to apply the 50% increase each year:

* 3 years ago: 200 students
* 2 years ago: 200 + (50% of 200) = 200 + 100 = 300 students
* 1 year ago: 300 + (50% of 300) = 300 + 150 = 450 students
* This year: 450 + (50% of 450) = 450 + 225 = 675 students

Answer: 675
