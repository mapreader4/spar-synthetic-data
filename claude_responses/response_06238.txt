Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mitch paid for 3 movie tickets at $7 each, so the total for the tickets is 3 x $7 = $21
* Jam paid for 2 boxes of popcorn at $1.5 each, so the total for the popcorn is 2 x $1.5 = $3
* Jay paid for 3 cups of milk tea at $3 each, so the total for the milk tea is 3 x $3 = $9
* The total expenses are the sum of the ticket cost, popcorn cost, and milk tea cost: $21 + $3 + $9 = $33
* Since the three friends will split the total expenses, each person should contribute 1/3 of the total, which is $33 / 3 = $11

Answer: $11
