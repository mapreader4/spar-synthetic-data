Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom dances 4 times a week
* Each dance session lasts 2 hours
* He does this every year for 10 years

First, let's calculate the number of hours he dances per week:
* 4 dance sessions per week x 2 hours per session = 8 hours per week

Next, let's calculate the number of hours he dances per year:
* 8 hours per week x 52 weeks in a year = 416 hours per year

Finally, let's calculate the total number of hours he dances over 10 years:
* 416 hours per year x 10 years = 4,160 hours

Answer: 4,160
