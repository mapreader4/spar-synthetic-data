Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The park is 1000 feet long and 2000 feet wide.
2) To find the total area of the park, we multiply the length by the width:
1000 feet x 2000 feet = 2,000,000 square feet
3) The problem states that there is 1 tree per 20 square feet.
4) To find the total number of trees, we divide the total area of the park by the area per tree:
2,000,000 square feet / 20 square feet per tree = 100,000 trees
Answer: 100,000
