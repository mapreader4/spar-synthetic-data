Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Antonio's weight is 50 kilograms
* Antonio's sister weighs 12 kilograms less than him
* To find the sister's weight, we subtract 12 kilograms from Antonio's weight:
    * 50 kilograms - 12 kilograms = 38 kilograms
* To find the total weight of the two siblings, we add Antonio's weight and his sister's weight:
    * 50 kilograms + 38 kilograms = 88 kilograms

Answer: 88 kilograms
