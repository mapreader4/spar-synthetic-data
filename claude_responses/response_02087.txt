Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The private company raised $2500 to be used for charity.
2) They donated 80% of the $2500 to a public foundation with 8 organizations.
3) To calculate the amount donated to the public foundation, we take 80% of $2500:
   * 80% of $2500 = 0.8 * $2500 = $2000
4) The public foundation has 8 organizations, so we need to divide the $2000 equally among them.
5) $2000 divided by 8 organizations = $2000 / 8 = $250 per organization.

Answer: $250
