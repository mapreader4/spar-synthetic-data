Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish.
2) 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, so the remaining number of blowfish must be 50 - 26 = 24.
3) These 24 blowfish swim into the display tank.
4) An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so there must be 24 clownfish in the display tank.
5) Then, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. That means 24 * (1/3) = 8 clownfish swim back.
6) So the number of clownfish remaining in the display tank is 24 - 8 = 16.
