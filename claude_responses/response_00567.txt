Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lilith originally had 5 dozen water bottles
* 5 dozen = 5 x 12 = 60 water bottles
* The original price she wanted to sell them at was $2 per water bottle
* However, she had to reduce the price to $1.85 per water bottle to match the regular price in her town
* So, the total amount of money she would have made selling 60 water bottles at $2 each would have been:
    - 60 water bottles x $2 per water bottle = $120
* But since she had to sell them at $1.85 each, the total amount of money she will make is:
    - 60 water bottles x $1.85 per water bottle = $111
* The difference between the original $120 and the actual $111 she will make is:
    - $120 - $111 = $9
* Therefore, Lilith will have to find an additional $9 to buy her friend the birthday gift.
