Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix
* The chef has 4 ounces of butter remaining
* The chef plans to use 6 cups of baking mix
* The recipe allows 2 ounces of coconut oil to be substituted for every 2 ounces of butter

First, let's calculate how much butter the chef can use with 6 cups of baking mix:
* 2 ounces of butter per 1 cup of baking mix
* 6 cups of baking mix x 2 ounces of butter per cup = 12 ounces of butter needed

Now, the chef only has 4 ounces of butter remaining, so he will need to substitute the remaining 8 ounces of butter with coconut oil.
* 8 ounces of butter / 2 ounces of butter per 2 ounces of coconut oil = 4 ounces of coconut oil

Answer: 4 ounces of coconut oil
