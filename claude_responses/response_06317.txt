To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Brady worked in the three months and then divide it by the number of months.

Given information:
- In April, Brady worked 6 hours every day.
- In June, Brady worked 5 hours every day.
- In September, Brady worked 8 hours every day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Brady worked in each month.
April: 6 hours per day × 30 days = 180 hours
June: 5 hours per day × 30 days = 150 hours
September: 8 hours per day × 30 days = 240 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Brady worked in the three months.
Total hours worked = 180 hours + 150 hours + 240 hours = 570 hours

Step 3: Calculate the average number of hours Brady worked per month.
Average hours per month = Total hours worked / Number of months
Average hours per month = 570 hours / 3 months = 190 hours

Answer: 190 hours
