Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of a chair is 1/7 of the cost of a table.
2) The cost of a table is $140.
3) To find the cost of a chair, we take the cost of the table ($140) and divide it by 7, since a chair costs 1/7 of the table.
4) $140 / 7 = $20. Therefore, the cost of a chair is $20.
5) To find the total cost of a table and 4 chairs, we add the cost of the table ($140) and the cost of 4 chairs (4 x $20 = $80).
6) $140 + $80 = $220.

Answer: $220
