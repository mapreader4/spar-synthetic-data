Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 20 students in Dikembe's class.
2) Each student needs 1.5 yards of floss.
3) To calculate the total amount of floss needed for the class, we multiply the number of students (20) by the amount of floss each student needs (1.5 yards):
20 students x 1.5 yards = 30 yards of floss needed.
4) Each packet of floss contains 35 yards.
5) To calculate the minimum number of packets Dikembe needs to buy, we divide the total amount of floss needed (30 yards) by the amount of floss in each packet (35 yards):
30 yards / 35 yards per packet = 0.857 packets
6) Since we can't buy a fraction of a packet, Dikembe needs to buy 1 packet.
7) Each packet contains 35 yards of floss.
8) The amount of floss left over is the total amount of floss in the packet (35 yards) minus the amount of floss needed (30 yards):
35 yards - 30 yards = 5 yards of floss left over.

Answer: 5 yards
