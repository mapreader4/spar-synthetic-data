Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 13 female students in the class
* There were three times as many male students as female students
* To find the number of male students, we multiply the number of female students (13) by 3:
* 13 x 3 = 39 male students
* To find the total number of students in the class, we add the number of female students (13) and the number of male students (39):
* 13 + 39 = 52 students

Answer: 52
