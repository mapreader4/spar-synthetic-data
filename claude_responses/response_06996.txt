Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bob gets a raise of $0.50/hour and works 40 hours a week.
2) This means his weekly earnings increase by $0.50 x 40 = $20.
3) However, his housing benefit is reduced by $60/month.
4) To calculate the impact on his weekly earnings, we need to convert the monthly reduction to a weekly reduction: $60/month รท 4 weeks/month = $15/week.
5) So, the net increase in his weekly earnings is $20 - $15 = $5.

Answer: $5
