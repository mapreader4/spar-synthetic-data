Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that a hare is 14 inches tall.
2) We are also given that a camel is 24 times taller than the hare.
3) To find the height of the camel, we need to multiply the height of the hare by 24.
4) 14 inches x 24 = 336 inches.
5) To convert the height of the camel from inches to feet, we need to divide 336 inches by 12 (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot).
6) 336 inches / 12 inches per foot = 28 feet.

Answer: 28 feet.
