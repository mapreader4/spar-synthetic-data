Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carson has 4 hours (240 minutes) to spend at the carnival
* The wait for the roller coaster is 30 minutes per ride
* Carson rides the roller coaster 4 times, so that's 4 x 30 minutes = 120 minutes
* The wait for the tilt-a-whirl is 60 minutes per ride
* Carson rides the tilt-a-whirl 1 time, so that's 60 minutes
* The wait for the giant slide is 15 minutes per ride
* The total time spent on the roller coaster and tilt-a-whirl is 120 + 60 = 180 minutes
* This leaves 240 - 180 = 60 minutes for the giant slide
* Since each ride on the giant slide takes 15 minutes, Carson can ride the giant slide 60 / 15 = 4 times.
