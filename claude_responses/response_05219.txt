Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The mirror is broken into 60 pieces.
2) Anne sweeps up half of the pieces, so she sweeps up 30 pieces.
3) That leaves 60 - 30 = 30 pieces remaining.
4) Her cat steals 3 pieces, so now there are 30 - 3 = 27 pieces remaining.
5) Her boyfriend picks up 1/3 of the remaining 27 pieces.
6) 1/3 of 27 is 27 / 3 = 9.
