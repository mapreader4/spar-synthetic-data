Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) The pizza was cut into 16 slices.
2) During dinner time, they ate one-fourth of the pizza. That means they ate 16 * 1/4 = 4 slices.
3) That leaves 16 - 4 = 12 slices of pizza remaining.
4) The next day, Yves ate one-fourth of the remaining pizza. That means he ate 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices.
5) That leaves 12 - 3 = 9 slices of pizza remaining.
6) Yves' two siblings each ate 2 slices, so they ate 2 * 2 = 4 slices.
7) That leaves 9 - 4 = 5 slices of pizza remaining.
