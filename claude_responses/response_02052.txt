To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of days it took Jane to read the entire book.

Given information:
- The book has 500 pages.
- Jane read the first half of the book (250 pages) at a speed of 10 pages per day.
- Jane read the second half of the book (250 pages) at a speed of 5 pages per day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days it took Jane to read the first half of the book.
Number of pages in the first half = 250 pages
Speed of reading the first half = 10 pages per day
Number of days to read the first half = 250 pages / 10 pages per day = 25 days

Step 2: Calculate the number of days it took Jane to read the second half of the book.
Number of pages in the second half = 250 pages
Speed of reading the second half = 5 pages per day
Number of days to read the second half = 250 pages / 5 pages per day = 50 days

Step 3: Calculate the total number of days it took Jane to read the entire book.
Total number of days = Number of days to read the first half + Number of days to read the second half
Total number of days = 25 days + 50 days = 75 days

Answer: 75 days
