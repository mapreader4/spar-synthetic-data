Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janice found 5 drawings on the first page
* The number of drawings increased by 5 after every page
* We want to find the total number of drawings in the first 5 pages

On the first page, there were 5 drawings.
On the second page, there would be 5 + 5 = 10 drawings.
On the third page, there would be 10 + 5 = 15 drawings.
On the fourth page, there would be 15 + 5 = 20 drawings.
On the fifth page, there would be 20 + 5 = 25 drawings.

To find the total number of drawings in the first 5 pages, we add up the drawings on each page:
5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 75

Answer: 75
