Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Teresa has 14 colored pencils and 35 black pencils, for a total of 14 + 35 = 49 pencils
* Her dad asks her to share all her pencils with her three younger siblings
* He tells her she can keep 10 of the pencils for herself
* So, the total number of pencils to be shared among the three siblings is 49 - 10 = 39 pencils
* Since each sibling should get an equal number of pencils, we divide the 39 pencils by 3 to get the number of pencils each sibling will receive
