Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Nick has 35 quarters in total.
2) 2/5 of the 35 quarters are state quarters. To calculate this, we multiply 35 by 2/5:
35 x 2/5 = 14 state quarters.
3) 50 percent of the 14 state quarters are Pennsylvania quarters. To calculate this, we multiply 14 by 0.5 (which is the same as 50 percent):
14 x 0.5 = 7 Pennsylvania state quarters.
