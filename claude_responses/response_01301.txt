Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The shower has 3 walls.
2) Each wall has 8 tiles running the width of the wall.
3) Each wall has 20 tiles running the height of the wall.
4) To find the total number of tiles in the shower, we need to multiply the number of tiles on each wall.
5) For each wall, the number of tiles is 8 (width) x 20 (height) = 160 tiles.
6) Since there are 3 walls, the total number of tiles in the shower is 3 x 160 = 480 tiles.

Answer: 480
