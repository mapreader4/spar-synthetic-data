Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carly collected 7 starfish, each with 5 arms.
2) To find the total number of arms for the starfish, we multiply the number of starfish (7) by the number of arms per starfish (5):
7 starfish x 5 arms per starfish = 35 arms
3) Carly also collected 1 seastar with 14 arms.
4) To find the total number of arms for all the animals, we add the arms from the starfish (35) and the arms from the seastar (14):
35 arms + 14 arms = 49 arms

Answer: 49
