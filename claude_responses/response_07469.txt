Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Josh makes 12 bracelets
2) It costs $1 for supplies for each bracelet
3) He sells each bracelet for $1.5
4) So the total revenue from selling the 12 bracelets is 12 * $1.5 = $18
5) The total cost of supplies for the 12 bracelets is 12 * $1 = $12
6) The profit from selling the 12 bracelets is $18 - $12 = $6
7) After buying the cookies, Josh has $3 left
8) So the cost of the box of cookies must have been $6 - $3 = $3
