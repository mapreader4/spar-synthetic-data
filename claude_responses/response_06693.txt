Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John's hair grows 1.5 inches every month
* He cuts his hair when it reaches 9 inches long, cutting it down to 6 inches
* A haircut costs $45, and he gives a 20% tip

First, we need to calculate how many months it takes for his hair to grow from 6 inches to 9 inches:
* 9 inches - 6 inches = 3 inches
* 3 inches / 1.5 inches per month = 2 months

So, John gets a haircut every 2 months.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of each haircut:
* Haircut cost: $45
* Tip (20%): $45 * 0.20 = $9
* Total cost per haircut: $45 + $9 = $54

Finally, we can calculate how much he spends on haircuts per year:
* 12 months / 2 months per haircut = 6 haircuts per year
* 6 haircuts per year * $54 per haircut = $324

Answer: $324
