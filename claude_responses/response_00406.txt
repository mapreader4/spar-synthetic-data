Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
2. The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 2 hours long.
3. They spent 10 minutes making popcorn.
4. They spent twice as long making fries, which is 20 minutes.
5. The total time spent cooking is 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes.
6. The total time spent watching the movies is 1 hour and 30 minutes + 2 hours = 3 hours and 30 minutes.
7. The total time spent cooking and watching the movies is 30 minutes + 3 hours and 30 minutes = 4 hours.

Answer: 4 hours.
