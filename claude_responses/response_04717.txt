Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The zoo has 21 penguins
* The zoo has twice as many polar bears as penguins
* To find the number of polar bears, we take the number of penguins (21) and multiply it by 2
* 21 penguins x 2 = 42 polar bears
* Now, to find the total number of animals, we add the number of penguins and the number of polar bears:
* 21 penguins + 42 polar bears = 63 total animals

Answer: 63
