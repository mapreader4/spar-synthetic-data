Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) George collected a total of 50 marbles.
2) Half of the marbles are white, so there are 25 white marbles.
3) There are 12 yellow marbles.
4) There are 50% fewer green marbles than yellow marbles. This means there are 6 green marbles (12 yellow marbles - 50% = 6 green marbles).
5) Now we can find the number of red marbles by subtracting the white, yellow, and green marbles from the total of 50 marbles:
50 total marbles - 25 white marbles - 12 yellow marbles - 6 green marbles = 7 red marbles.
