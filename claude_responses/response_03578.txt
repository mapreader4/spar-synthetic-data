Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that Lisa has 18 more dresses than Ana.
2) We also know that the total number of dresses between Lisa and Ana is 48.
3) Let's represent the number of dresses Ana has as x.
4) Since Lisa has 18 more dresses than Ana, we can represent Lisa's dresses as x + 18.
5) The total number of dresses is 48, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 18) = 48
6) Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 18 = 48
7) Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get:
2x = 30
8) Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 15
Answer: Ana has 15 dresses.
