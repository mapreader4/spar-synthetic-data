Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Porche has 3 hours to get all her homework done
* Her math homework takes her 45 minutes
* Her English homework takes her 30 minutes
* Her science homework takes her 50 minutes
* Her history homework takes her 25 minutes
* To calculate the total time spent on her homework:
    - Math: 45 minutes
    - English: 30 minutes
    - Science: 50 minutes
    - History: 25 minutes
    - Total time spent on homework: 45 + 30 + 50 + 25 = 150 minutes
* Now, we need to convert the total time spent on homework from minutes to hours:
    - 150 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes
* Porche has 3 hours to get all her homework done, and she spent 2 hours and 30 minutes on her homework
* Therefore, the amount of time she has left to get her special project done is:
    - 3 hours - 2 hours and 30 minutes = 30 minutes

Answer: 30 minutes
