Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Monroe made 200 granola bars in total.
2) She and her husband ate 80 of them.
3) The remaining granola bars were divided equally among her children.
4) Each child received 20 granola bars.
5) To find the number of children, we need to find how many 20-bar portions are left after Monroe and her husband ate 80.
6) The remaining granola bars after Monroe and her husband ate 80 is 200 - 80 = 120.
7) Since each child received 20 granola bars, we can divide the remaining 120 by 20 to find the number of children.
8) 120 / 20 = 6.
