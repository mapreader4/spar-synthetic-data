Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bridgette is inviting 84 guests
2) Alex is inviting two-thirds of that number, which is 2/3 * 84 = 56 guests
3) The total number of guests is 84 + 56 = 140 guests
4) The caterer makes 10 extra plates, so the total number of plates is 140 + 10 = 150 plates
5) Each plate has 8 asparagus spears
6) Therefore, the total number of asparagus spears needed is 150 plates * 8 spears per plate = 1,200 asparagus spears

Answer: 1,200
