Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The dietitian ate three-fourths of her lunch during her lunch break.
2) The total amount of food she had prepared for lunch had 40 calories.
3) Three-fourths of 40 calories is:
   * 3/4 * 40 = 30 calories
4) The recommended calorie intake by the FDA is 25 calories.
5) The difference between the amount she ate (30 calories) and the recommended amount (25 calories) is:
   * 30 - 25 = 5 calories

Answer: 5
