Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Duke found 10 movies in the first box that were priced at $2.00 each.
2. He also found 5 movies in the second box that were priced at $5.00 each.
3. To calculate the average price, we need to find the total cost of all the movies he bought, and then divide that by the total number of movies.

Total cost of the movies from the first box:
* 10 movies x $2.00 each = $20.00

Total cost of the movies from the second box:
* 5 movies x $5.00 each = $25.00

Total cost of all the movies:
* $20.00 + $25.00 = $45.00

Total number of movies:
* 10 + 5 = 15 movies

Average price per DVD:
* $45.00 / 15 movies = $3.00 per DVD
