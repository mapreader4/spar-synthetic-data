Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The former job of the private school teacher paid $45,000 per year.
2) The parents offered him a 20% raise. To calculate the new salary:
   - 20% of $45,000 is $9,000 (20% of $45,000 = 0.2 * $45,000 = $9,000)
   - So the new salary is $45,000 + $9,000 = $54,000 per year.
3) There are 9 kids in the group.
4) To calculate how much each parent has to pay, we need to divide the new salary by the number of kids:
   - $54,000 / 9 = $6,000 per kid.

Answer: $6,000
