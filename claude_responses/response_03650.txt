Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martin decided to spend no more than $1,000 on the television.
2) The sales clerk offered the TV for $100 less than the original price.
3) The sales clerk also offered an additional 20% off the discounted price.
4) To calculate the final discounted price:
   - Original price - $100 = Discounted price
   - Discounted price - (Discounted price * 0.20) = Final price
5) Let's say the original price was $X.
   - Discounted price = $X - $100
   - Final price = ($X - $100) - (($X - $100) * 0.20)
   - Final price = ($X - $100) - $0.20($X - $100)
   - Final price = $0.80($X - $100)
6) The final price is $0.80($X - $100), which is lower than the $1,000 Martin decided to spend.
7) To find how much lower the final price is than $1,000, we subtract:
   - $1,000 - $0.80($X - $100) = $0.20($X - $100)

Answer: $0.20($X - $100)
