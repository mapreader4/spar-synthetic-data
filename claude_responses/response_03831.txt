Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerry bought 48 firecrackers.
2) The police officer confiscated 12 of them, so Jerry had 48 - 12 = 36 firecrackers remaining.
3) 1/6 of the remaining 36 firecrackers were defective, which means 36 / 6 = 6 firecrackers were defective.
4) So Jerry had 36 - 6 = 30 good firecrackers remaining.
5) Jerry set off half of the 30 good firecrackers, which is 30 / 2 = 15 firecrackers.
