Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 600 students at River Falls High School.
2) 3/4 of the 600 students play tennis. To calculate this, we take 3/4 of 600, which is 450 students.
3) Of the 450 students who play tennis, 60% of them also play hockey. To calculate this, we take 60% of 450, which is 270 students.
4) Therefore, the number of students who play both hockey and tennis is 270.

Answer: 270
