Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joe's total pocket money is $450.
2) He spent 1/9 of his pocket money on chocolates.
   - 1/9 of $450 = $450 * 1/9 = $50
   - So, he spent $50 on chocolates.
3) He spent 2/5 of his pocket money on fruits.
   - 2/5 of $450 = $450 * 2/5 = $180
   - So, he spent $180 on fruits.
4) To calculate the amount of money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on chocolates and fruits from his total pocket money.
   - Total pocket money: $450
   - Amount spent on chocolates: $50
   - Amount spent on fruits: $180
   - Amount left: $450 - $50 - $180 = $220

Answer: $220
