Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The truck can carry a maximum of 13,500 kgs of supplies
* Yesterday, the truck was loaded with:
  - 100 boxes that weigh 100 kgs each, so 100 * 100 = 10,000 kgs
  - 10 crates which weigh 60 kgs each, so 10 * 60 = 600 kgs
  - Total weight from yesterday's load: 10,000 + 600 = 10,600 kgs
* Today, the truck was loaded with:
  - 50 sacks which weigh 50 kgs each, so 50 * 50 = 2,500 kgs
  - Total weight from today's load: 2,500 kgs
* Total weight loaded so far: 10,600 + 2,500 = 13,100 kgs
* The truck's maximum capacity is 13,500 kgs
* Therefore, the remaining capacity is 13,500 - 13,100 = 400 kgs
* Each bag weighs 40 kgs
* 400 kgs / 40 kgs per bag = 10 bags
