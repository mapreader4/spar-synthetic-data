Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry has already interrupted twice, which is 2 x 5 = 10 points
* Jerry has already insulted his classmates 4 times, which is 4 x 10 = 40 points
* So Jerry has already accumulated 10 + 40 = 50 points
* To get sent to the office, Jerry needs to reach 100 points
* So the number of times Jerry can throw things before he gets sent to the office is:
* (100 points - 50 points) / 25 points per throw = 2 times
