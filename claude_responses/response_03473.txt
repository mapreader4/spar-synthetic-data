Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tricia ordered three dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.
2) She will use 1/4 of the 36 eggs for making crepes. 1/4 of 36 is 36 / 4 = 9 eggs.
3) That leaves 36 - 9 = 27 eggs remaining.
4) She will use 2/3 of the remaining 27 eggs for making cupcakes. 2/3 of 27 is 27 * 2/3 = 18 eggs.
5) That leaves 27 - 18 = 9 eggs remaining to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast.
