Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mike and John each ordered the Taco Grande Plate as their main meal
* Mike also ordered:
    - A side salad for $2
    - A plate of cheesy fries for $4
    - A diet cola for $2
* Mike's total bill was twice as large as John's bill
* Let's call the cost of the Taco Grande Plate 'x'
* Mike's bill = x + $2 + $4 + $2 = 2x
* John's bill = x
* The combined total cost of Mike and John's lunch = 2x + x = 3x

Now, we need to find the value of 'x' to determine the combined total cost.
* Since Mike's bill was twice as large as John's bill, we can say:
    2x = 2 * x
    2x = 2x
    Therefore, x = $10

Now we can calculate the combined total cost:
* Combined total cost = 3x = 3 * $10 = $30

Answer: $30
