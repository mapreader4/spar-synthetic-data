Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gunther needs to:
  - Vacuum the carpets: 45 minutes
  - Dust the furniture: 60 minutes
  - Mop the floors in the kitchen: 30 minutes
  - Brush each of his 3 cats: 5 minutes per cat, so 3 x 5 = 15 minutes
* Adding up all the tasks:
  - 45 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes + 15 minutes = 150 minutes
* Gunther has 3 hours of free time available, which is 180 minutes.
* To find the amount of free time left after cleaning the apartment, we subtract the time needed for cleaning from the total free time:
  - 180 minutes - 150 minutes = 30 minutes

Answer: 30 minutes
