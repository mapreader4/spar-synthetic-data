Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brian goes fishing twice as often as Chris
* Brian catches 2/5 times fewer fish than Chris per trip
* Brian caught 400 fish every time he went fishing
* Chris went fishing 10 times

First, let's find out how many times Brian went fishing:
* Since Brian goes fishing twice as often as Chris, and Chris went fishing 10 times, then Brian went fishing 20 times.

Now, let's find out how many fish Chris caught per trip:
* Brian catches 2/5 times fewer fish than Chris per trip
* So, if Brian caught 400 fish per trip, then Chris must have caught 400 / (1 - 2/5) = 400 / 0.6 = 667 fish per trip

Finally, let's find the total number of fish caught:
* Brian caught 400 fish per trip, and went fishing 20 times, so he caught 400 * 20 = 8,000 fish
* Chris caught 667 fish per trip, and went fishing 10 times, so he caught 667 * 10 = 6,670 fish
* The total number of fish caught is 8,000 + 6,670 = 14,670 fish

Answer: 14,670
