Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Regina has 20 cows
* She has four times more pigs than cows, so she has 4 x 20 = 80 pigs
* She can sell each cow for $800
* She can sell each pig for $400
* To calculate the total money she would earn, we need to:
   - Multiply the number of cows (20) by the price per cow ($800) to get the total for the cows: 20 x $800 = $16,000
   - Multiply the number of pigs (80) by the price per pig ($400) to get the total for the pigs: 80 x $400 = $32,000
   - Add the total for the cows and the total for the pigs to get the total money she would earn: $16,000 + $32,000 = $48,000

Answer: $48,000
