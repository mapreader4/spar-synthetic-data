Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school.
2) After school, he comes back to the house, which is another 50 meters.
3) So the total distance walked from the house to school and back is 50 + 50 = 100 meters.
4) Andy then goes from the house to the market, which is the remaining distance.
5) The total distance walked is 140 meters.
6) Therefore, the distance between the house and the market is 140 - 100 = 40 meters.

Answer: 40
