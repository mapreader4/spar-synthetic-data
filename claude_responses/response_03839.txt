Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Quentavious has 5 nickels to start with.
2) His friend offers him 2 pieces of gum per nickel.
3) Quentavious leaves with 2 nickels.
4) So, Quentavious started with 5 nickels and ended up with 2 nickels.
5) That means he traded in 3 nickels for gum.
6) Since he gets 2 pieces of gum per nickel, he would have received 3 x 2 = 6 pieces of gum.
