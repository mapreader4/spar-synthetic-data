Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Ben has 56 marbles.
2) Leo has 20 more marbles than Ben, so Leo has 56 + 20 = 76 marbles.
3) The total number of marbles in the jar is the sum of Ben's marbles and Leo's marbles.
4) The total number of marbles in the jar is 56 + 76 = 132 marbles.

Answer: 132
