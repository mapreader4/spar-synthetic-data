Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Mary initially weighed 99 pounds
* She dropped a dozen pounds (12 pounds)
* Then, she added back twice the weight that she initially lost, which is 2 x 12 = 24 pounds
* Then, she dropped three times more weight than she initially had lost, which is 3 x 12 = 36 pounds
* Finally, she gained back half of a dozen pounds, which is 1/2 x 12 = 6 pounds

Now, let's calculate her final weight:
* Initial weight: 99 pounds
* Dropped 12 pounds: 99 - 12 = 87 pounds
* Added 24 pounds: 87 + 24 = 111 pounds
* Dropped 36 pounds: 111 - 36 = 75 pounds
* Gained 6 pounds: 75 + 6 = 81 pounds

Answer: 81 pounds
