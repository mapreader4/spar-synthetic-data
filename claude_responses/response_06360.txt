Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elisa and her two friends each ordered a meal worth $10
* So the total cost of the meals was 3 x $10 = $30
* Afterwards, they each had a scoop of the same kind of ice cream
* Elisa had $45 and that was enough to pay for everything
* So the total cost of the dinner, including the ice cream, was $45
* To find the cost of a scoop of ice cream, we need to subtract the cost of the meals from the total cost:
* Total cost: $45
* Cost of meals: $30
* Cost of ice cream: $45 - $30 = $15
* Since there were 3 people, the cost of a scoop of ice cream was $15 / 3 = $5
