Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There are 36 seagulls on the roof of the Taco Bell.
2) Kids scare away 1/4 of the seagulls by throwing stones.
   * 1/4 of 36 = 36 * 0.25 = 9 seagulls scared away
   * So, there are 36 - 9 = 27 seagulls remaining.
3) 1/3 of the remaining 27 seagulls decide to fly to the McDonald's parking lot.
   * 1/3 of 27 = 27 * 0.33 = 9 seagulls fly to McDonald's
   * So, there are 27 - 9 = 18 seagulls left.

Answer: 18 seagulls are left.
