Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 42 crepe myrtle trees in the park
* One-third of them are pink
* To calculate one-third of 42:
  * 42 รท 3 = 14
  * So there are 14 pink crepe myrtle trees
* Only 2 of them are red
* The remaining trees must be white
* To calculate the number of white trees:
  * Total trees: 42
  * Pink trees: 14
  * Red trees: 2
  * White trees: 42 - 14 - 2 = 26

Answer: 26
