Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) John travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally.
2) His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.
3) To find the horizontal distance, we can set up a proportion:
   Vertical distance / Horizontal distance = 1 / 2
   (1450 feet - 100 feet) / Horizontal distance = 1 / 2
4) Solving for the horizontal distance, we get:
   Horizontal distance = (1450 feet - 100 feet) * 2 = 2700 feet.

Answer: 2700
