Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) The largest room is 45 feet wide and 30 feet long.
2) To find the area of the largest room, we multiply the width and the length:
   Area of largest room = 45 feet x 30 feet = 1,350 square feet.

3) The smallest room is 15 feet wide and 8 feet long.
4) To find the area of the smallest room, we multiply the width and the length:
   Area of smallest room = 15 feet x 8 feet = 120 square feet.

5) To find the difference in area between the largest room and the smallest room, we subtract the area of the smallest room from the area of the largest room:
   Difference in area = 1,350 square feet - 120 square feet = 1,230 square feet.

Answer: 1,230
