Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 10 boxes of Capri-sun
* Each box has 6 pouches
* So the total number of pouches James bought is 10 boxes x 6 pouches per box = 60 pouches
* James paid $12 for the 60 pouches
* To find the cost per pouch, we divide the total cost ($12) by the total number of pouches (60)
* $12 / 60 pouches = $0.20 per pouch
* To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
* $0.20 per pouch x 100 cents/dollar = 20 cents per pouch

Answer: 20 cents
