Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jack has 42 pounds, 11 euros, and 3000 yen.
2) We need to convert the pounds and euros to yen.
3) 1 euro = 2 pounds, so 11 euros = 22 pounds.
4) 42 pounds + 22 pounds = 64 pounds.
5) 1 pound = 100 yen, so 64 pounds = 6400 yen.
6) Adding the 3000 yen Jack already has, the total amount in yen is:
6400 yen + 3000 yen = 9400 yen.

Answer: 9400
