Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that the sum of the ages of three boys is 29.
2) We are also given that two of the boys are the same age, and the third boy is 11 years old.
3) Let's call the age of the two boys who are the same age "x".
4) The third boy is 11 years old, so the total of the three ages is x + x + 11 = 29.
5) Solving this equation, we get 2x + 11 = 29.
6) Subtracting 11 from both sides, we get 2x = 18.
7) Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 9.
8) Therefore, the two boys who are the same age are both 9 years old.
