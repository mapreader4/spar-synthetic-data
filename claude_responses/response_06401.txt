Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leo caught 40 fish
* Agrey caught 20 more fish than Leo
* To find the number of fish Agrey caught, we add 20 to the number of fish Leo caught:
* Agrey's fish = Leo's fish + 20
* Agrey's fish = 40 + 20 = 60 fish
* To find the total number of fish they caught together, we add Leo's fish and Agrey's fish:
* Total fish = Leo's fish + Agrey's fish
* Total fish = 40 + 60 = 100 fish

Answer: 100
