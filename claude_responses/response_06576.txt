Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aaron uses 3 equal-sized boxes of canned tomatoes
* He adds the lids he gets from these 3 boxes to the 14 can lids he already has
* He is now taking 53 can lids to the recycling center

To find the number of can lids he got from each box, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of new can lids he got from the 3 boxes
2. Divide that total by 3 to get the number of can lids per box

First, let's calculate the total number of new can lids:
* Total can lids = 53 (the amount he is taking to the recycling center)
* Lids he already had = 14
* New can lids = 53 - 14 = 39

Now, we divide the new can lids by 3 to get the number of can lids per box:
* Can lids per box = 39 / 3 = 13

Therefore, Aaron got 13 can lids from each box.

Answer: 13
