Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ragnar can get 3 blocks of wood for every tree he cuts
* Ragnar chops 2 trees every day
* We want to know how many blocks of wood he gets after 5 days

First, let's calculate how many trees Ragnar chops in 5 days:
* 2 trees per day x 5 days = 10 trees

Now, let's calculate how many blocks of wood he gets from those 10 trees:
* 3 blocks of wood per tree x 10 trees = 30 blocks of wood

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 30
