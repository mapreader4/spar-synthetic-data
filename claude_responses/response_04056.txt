Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Terry's daily income is $24.
2) Terry works 7 days a week, so his weekly income is:
   $24 per day x 7 days per week = $168 per week
3) Jordan's daily income is $30.
4) Jordan works 7 days a week, so his weekly income is:
   $30 per day x 7 days per week = $210 per week
5) The difference between their weekly incomes is:
   $210 (Jordan's weekly income) - $168 (Terry's weekly income) = $42

Answer: $42
