Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The sum of Cooper's, Dante's, and Maria's ages is 31.
2) Dante is twice as old as Cooper. So if Cooper's age is x, then Dante's age is 2x.
3) Maria is one year older than Dante. So if Dante's age is 2x, then Maria's age is 2x + 1.
4) Now we can set up an equation to solve for x:
   x + 2x + (2x + 1) = 31
   5x + 1 = 31
   5x = 30
   x = 6
Therefore, Cooper is 6 years old.

Answer: 6
