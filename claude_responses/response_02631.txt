Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenson makes 3 shirts per day
* Each shirt uses 2 yards of fabric
* So, Jenson uses 3 * 2 = 6 yards of fabric per day
* Kingsley makes 5 pairs of pants per day
* Each pair of pants uses 5 yards of fabric
* So, Kingsley uses 5 * 5 = 25 yards of fabric per day
* In total, they use 6 + 25 = 31 yards of fabric per day
* They need to calculate the fabric needed every 3 days
* So, the total fabric needed every 3 days is 31 * 3 = 93 yards

Answer: 93
