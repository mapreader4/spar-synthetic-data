Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Terry spent $6 for breakfast.
2. On Tuesday, Terry spent twice as much as he did on Monday, which is 2 x $6 = $12.
3. On Wednesday, Terry spent double what he did the previous two days combined. 
   - The previous two days, he spent $6 + $12 = $18.
   - Double that is 2 x $18 = $36.
4. To calculate the total amount Terry spent, we add up the amounts from each day:
   - Monday: $6
   - Tuesday: $12
   - Wednesday: $36
   - Total: $6 + $12 + $36 = $54
