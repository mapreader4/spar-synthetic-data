Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gigi has 15 jellybeans.
2) Rory has 30 more jellybeans than Gigi, so Rory has 15 + 30 = 45 jellybeans.
3) The total number of jellybeans that Gigi and Rory have is 15 + 45 = 60 jellybeans.
4) Lorelai has already eaten three times the number of jellybeans that both girls have, which is 3 * 60 = 180 jellybeans.

Answer: 180
