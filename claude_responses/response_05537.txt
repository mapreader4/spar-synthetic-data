Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Cody needs to log a total of 100,000 steps to get the discount
* In the first week, he logs 1,000 steps per day
* Each week, he increases his daily steps by 1,000
* We want to know how far away from his goal he will be after 4 weeks

First, let's calculate how many steps he logs in the first week:
* 1,000 steps per day x 7 days = 7,000 steps

Now, let's calculate how many steps he logs in the second week:
* 2,000 steps per day x 7 days = 14,000 steps

In the third week, he logs:
* 3,000 steps per day x 7 days = 21,000 steps

And in the fourth week, he logs:
* 4,000 steps per day x 7 days = 28,000 steps

Now, let's add up the total steps he has logged after 4 weeks:
* 7,000 + 14,000 + 21,000 + 28,000 = 70,000 steps

To find how far away he is from his goal of 100,000 steps, we subtract the total steps logged from the goal:
* 100,000 - 70,000 = 30,000 steps

Answer: 30,000
