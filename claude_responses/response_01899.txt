Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 3 times as many grape candies as cherry candies.
2) We also know that there are 2 times as many apple candies as grape candies.
3) All the candies cost $2.50 each.
4) The total cost of the candies is $200.

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of cherry candies
* Then 3x = the number of grape candies
* And 2(3x) = 6x = the number of apple candies

The total number of candies is x + 3x + 6x = 10x.
The total cost of the candies is 10x * $2.50 = $25x.

We know the total cost is $200, so we can set up an equation:
$25x = $200
x = 8

Therefore, the number of grape candies is 3x = 3 * 8 = 24.
