Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kevin found 5 eggs
* Bonnie found 13 eggs
* George found 9 eggs
* Cheryl found 56 eggs

To find the total number of eggs found by Kevin, Bonnie, and George, we add their individual totals:
* 5 + 13 + 9 = 27 eggs

Now, to find how many more eggs Cheryl found than the other three children, we subtract the total found by Kevin, Bonnie, and George from the number Cheryl found:
* 56 - 27 = 29 eggs

Answer: 29
