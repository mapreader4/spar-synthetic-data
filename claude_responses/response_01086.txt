Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mr. Alonzo harvested 245.5 kg of tomatoes.
2) He sold 125.5 kg to Mrs. Maxwell.
3) He sold 78 kg to Mr. Wilson.
4) To find the amount of tomatoes not sold, we need to add up the amounts sold and subtract that from the total harvested.
5) The total amount sold is 125.5 kg + 78 kg = 203.5 kg.
6) The total amount harvested was 245.5 kg.
7) The amount not sold is 245.5 kg - 203.5 kg = 42 kg.

Answer: 42 kg
