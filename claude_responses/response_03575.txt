Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The apartment building has 12 floors total
* Half of the floors are full, which means 6 floors are full
* The remaining 6 floors are all at half-capacity
* Each floor has 10 apartments
* Each apartment has 4 people

First, let's calculate the number of people in the 6 full floors:
* 6 full floors x 10 apartments per floor x 4 people per apartment = 240 people

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the 6 half-capacity floors:
* 6 half-capacity floors x 10 apartments per floor x 2 people per apartment (since they are half-capacity) = 120 people

Finally, we add the people in the full floors and the half-capacity floors:
* 240 people + 120 people = 360 people

Answer: 360
