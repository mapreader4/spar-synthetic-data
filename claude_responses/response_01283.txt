Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Dan spent an hour doing 400 work tasks at $0.25 each.
   * Total earnings from the lower-paid work = 400 tasks x $0.25 per task = $100

2. Dan spent an hour doing 5 work tasks at $2.00 each.
   * Total earnings from the good work = 5 tasks x $2.00 per task = $10

3. To calculate the difference in earnings:
   * Earnings from good work - Earnings from lower-paid work = $10 - $100 = -$90

Therefore, Dan made $90 less doing the good work compared to the lower-paid work.

Answer: -$90
