Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Darla needs to pay $4 per watt of electricity.
2) She needs to pay for 300 watts of electricity.
3) To calculate the cost of the electricity, we multiply the cost per watt ($4) by the number of watts (300):
   $4 per watt x 300 watts = $1,200
4) In addition to the cost of the electricity, Darla also needs to pay a $150 late fee.
5) To calculate the total amount Darla needs to pay, we add the cost of the electricity ($1,200) and the late fee ($150):
   $1,200 + $150 = $1,350

Answer: $1,350
