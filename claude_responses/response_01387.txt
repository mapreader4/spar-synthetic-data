Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) John has 54 pieces of gum
2) Cole has 45 pieces of gum
3) Aubrey has 0 pieces of gum
4) They want to share the gum equally between the 3 of them
5) To find the total number of pieces of gum, we add up the amounts that John and Cole have:
54 + 45 = 99 pieces of gum
6) To find how many pieces each person will get, we divide the total number of pieces (99) by the number of people (3):
99 / 3 = 33

Answer: 33
