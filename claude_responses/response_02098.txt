Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* There are 270 hens and 3 roosters in the chicken coop
* Each hen lays 1 egg every morning
* Ms. Mosel collects the eggs for 1 hour every morning
* She then puts the eggs in boxes of 6
* This takes her another 40 minutes
* She does this every day, from Monday to Sunday

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs collected each day:
* 270 hens x 1 egg per hen = 270 eggs per day

Next, let's calculate how many boxes she fills each day:
* 270 eggs per day / 6 eggs per box = 45 boxes per day

Finally, to calculate the total number of boxes filled each week:
* 45 boxes per day x 7 days per week = 315 boxes per week

Answer: 315
