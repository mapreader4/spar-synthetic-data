Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Randy had some money to start with.
2) Smith gave him another $200.
3) Randy then gave Sally $1,200.
4) Randy has $2,000 left.

To find out how much money Randy had at first, we can work backwards:
1) Randy has $2,000 left.
2) He gave Sally $1,200, so before that he had $2,000 + $1,200 = $3,200.
3) Smith gave him $200, so before that he had $3,200 - $200 = $3,000.

Therefore, the amount of money Randy had at first was $3,000.

Answer: 3000
