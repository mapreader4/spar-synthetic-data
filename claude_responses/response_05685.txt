Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee in 10 years
* Kilee is currently 20 years old
* So in 10 years, Kilee will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old
* And Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee, so she will be 3 * 30 = 90 years old
* Now, we need to find Cornelia's current age
* Since Cornelia will be 90 in 10 years, her current age must be 90 - 10 = 80 years old

Answer: 80
