Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lana's goal is to sell 20 muffins at the bake sale.
2) In the morning, she sold 12 muffins.
3) In the afternoon, she sold 4 more muffins.
4) To calculate the total number of muffins she has sold so far, we add the morning and afternoon sales:
12 + 4 = 16 muffins sold
5) To calculate how many more muffins she needs to sell to hit her goal of 20, we subtract the total muffins sold from her goal:
20 - 16 = 4 muffins
