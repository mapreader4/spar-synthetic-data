Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The solver flipped a coin 211 times.
2) The solver got a head on 65 of the flips.
3) To find the number of tails, we subtract the number of heads from the total number of flips:
211 (total flips) - 65 (heads) = 146 (tails)
4) To find the difference between the number of tails and the number of heads, we subtract the number of heads from the number of tails:
146 (tails) - 65 (heads) = 81

Answer: 81
