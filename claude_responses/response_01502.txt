Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dani brings 2.5 dozen cupcakes. 2.5 dozen is equal to 30 cupcakes.
2) There are 27 students in the class, plus 1 teacher and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people in the class.
3) 3 students called in sick, so there are 24 students in the class that day.
4) Dani gives one cupcake to each person in the class, so she gives out 24 cupcakes.
5) The remaining cupcakes are 30 - 24 = 6 cupcakes.

Answer: 6 cupcakes.
