Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Henry originally had 99 books in his book collection
* He filled 3 boxes of 15 books each to take to a donation center, which is 3 * 15 = 45 books
* He had 21 books in a room he could donate
* He had 4 books on his coffee table
* He had 18 cookbooks stashed in the kitchen
* So the total number of books he donated is 45 + 21 + 4 + 18 = 88 books
* He then grabbed 12 books from the "free to a good home" box to take back to his place
* So the number of books Henry now has is 99 - 88 + 12 = 23 books
