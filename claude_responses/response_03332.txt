Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Nancy and Jason are learning to dance for the first time
* Nancy steps on her partner's feet 3 times as often as Jason
* Together, they step on each other's feet 32 times

Let's represent the number of times Jason steps on his partner's feet as x.
Since Nancy steps on her partner's feet 3 times as often as Jason, the number of times Nancy steps on her partner's feet is 3x.

The total number of times they step on each other's feet is 32, so we can write the equation:
x + 3x = 32

Solving for x, we get:
4x = 32
x = 8

Therefore, Jason steps on his partner's feet 8 times.

Answer: 8
