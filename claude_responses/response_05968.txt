Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The tree is currently 10 feet tall.
* The tree grows at a rate of 2 feet per week.
* We want to know the tree's height after 4 months, where each month is 4 weeks long.
* So, the total number of weeks in 4 months is 4 * 4 = 16 weeks.
* In 16 weeks, the tree will grow 2 feet per week, which is a total of 2 * 16 = 32 feet.
* The initial height of the tree was 10 feet.
* So, the total height of the tree after 4 months will be 10 feet + 32 feet = 42 feet.

Answer: 42
