Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first 100 channels cost $100
2) The next 100 channels cost half of $100, which is $50
3) The total cost of the cable program is $100 + $50 = $150
4) James is splitting the cost evenly with his roommate
5) Therefore, James pays half of the total cost, which is $150 / 2 = $75

Answer: $75
