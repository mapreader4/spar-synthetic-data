Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices.
2) Penny sells 7 cheesecake pies.
3) Each slice of cheesecake costs $7.
4) To calculate the total money Penny makes, we need to multiply the number of slices sold by the cost per slice.
5) The number of slices sold is 7 pies x 6 slices per pie = 42 slices.
6) The cost per slice is $7.
7) The total money Penny makes is 42 slices x $7 per slice = $294.

Answer: $294
