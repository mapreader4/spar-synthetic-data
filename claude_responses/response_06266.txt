Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Friday, Addison sold 181 raffle tickets
* On Saturday, she sold twice as many as Friday, which means she sold 2 * 181 = 362 raffle tickets
* On Sunday, she sold 78 raffle tickets

Now, to find how many more raffle tickets were sold on Saturday than Sunday, we need to subtract the number sold on Sunday from the number sold on Saturday:
* 362 (Saturday) - 78 (Sunday) = 284

Answer: 284
