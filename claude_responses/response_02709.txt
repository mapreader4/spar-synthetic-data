Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Class A is twice as big as Class B
* Class A is a third the size of Class C
* Class B has 20 people in it

First, we can find the size of Class A:
* Since Class A is twice as big as Class B, and Class B has 20 people, then Class A has 2 * 20 = 40 people.

Next, we can find the size of Class C:
* Since Class A is a third the size of Class C, and Class A has 40 people, then Class C has 3 * 40 = 120 people.

Answer: 120
