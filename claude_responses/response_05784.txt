Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jay bought a book for $25, a pen for $4, and a ruler for $1.
2) The total cost of the items is $25 + $4 + $1 = $30.
3) Jay paid with a fifty-dollar bill, which is $50.
4) To calculate the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
$50 - $30 = $20.

Answer: 20
