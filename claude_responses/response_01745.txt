Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Agnes makes $15 per hour
* Agnes works 8 hours per week
* So Agnes earns $15 x 8 = $120 per week
* There are 4 weeks in a month
* So Agnes earns $120 x 4 = $480 per month
* Mila makes $10 per hour
* To earn the same amount as Agnes in a month, Mila needs to work enough hours to earn $480
* To calculate how many hours Mila needs to work, we divide $480 by $10 per hour
* $480 / $10 per hour = 48 hours

Answer: 48 hours
