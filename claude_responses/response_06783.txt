Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lyle wants to buy a sandwich and a pack of juice for himself and his friends.
2) A sandwich costs $0.30 and a pack of juice costs $0.20.
3) Lyle has $2.50 to spend.
4) To calculate how many of his friends can have a sandwich and a pack of juice, we need to find out how many sets of a sandwich and a pack of juice Lyle can afford.
5) Each set of a sandwich and a pack of juice costs $0.30 + $0.20 = $0.50.
6) Lyle has $2.50 to spend, so he can afford 2.50 / 0.50 = 5 sets of a sandwich and a pack of juice.
7) Since Lyle is buying one set for himself, he can buy 4 sets for his friends.
