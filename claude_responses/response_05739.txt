Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vanessa needs to save $80 to buy the dress
* She already has $20 in savings
* She gets $30 every week from her parents
* She spends $10 each weekend at the arcades

First, let's calculate how much money she can save each week:
* She gets $30 from her parents
* She spends $10 at the arcades
* So, she can save $20 each week

Now, let's calculate how many weeks it will take her to save up the remaining $60:
* She needs to save $60 more
* She can save $20 each week
* So, it will take her 3 weeks to save up the remaining $60

Therefore, it will take Vanessa 3 weeks to save up enough money to buy the $80 dress.
