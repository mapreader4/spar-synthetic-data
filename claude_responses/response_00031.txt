Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Noah charges $60 for a large painting
* Noah charges $30 for a small painting
* Last month, he sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings
* To calculate his sales for last month:
    - 8 large paintings x $60 = $480
    - 4 small paintings x $30 = $120
    - Total sales last month = $480 + $120 = $600
* This month, he sold twice as much as last month
    - 16 large paintings x $60 = $960
    - 8 small paintings x $30 = $240
    - Total sales this month = $960 + $240 = $1,200

Answer: $1,200
