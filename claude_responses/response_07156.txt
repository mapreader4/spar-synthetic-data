Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rich ran a 24-mile marathon
* It took him 3 hours and 36 minutes to complete the marathon
* To calculate the average time per mile, we need to convert the total time to minutes
* 3 hours = 180 minutes
* 36 minutes
* Total time = 180 + 36 = 216 minutes
* To find the average time per mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles:
* 216 minutes / 24 miles = 9 minutes per mile

Answer: 9 minutes
