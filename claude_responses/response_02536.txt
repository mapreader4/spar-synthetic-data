Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tina can make 30 postcards per day
* She sells each postcard for $5
* She managed to sell all the postcards she made every day for 6 days

To calculate the total amount of money Tina earned, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of postcards she made over the 6 days
2. Multiply the total number of postcards by the price per postcard ($5)

Step 1: Total number of postcards made
* 30 postcards per day x 6 days = 180 postcards

Step 2: Total money earned
* 180 postcards x $5 per postcard = $900

Answer: $900
