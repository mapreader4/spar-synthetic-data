Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The toothpaste contains 105 grams
* Anne's dad uses 3 grams per brushing
* Anne's mom uses 2 grams per brushing
* Anne and her brother each use 1 gram per brushing
* Each member of the family brushes their teeth 3 times a day

First, let's calculate the total amount of toothpaste used per day:
* Anne's dad: 3 grams x 3 brushings = 9 grams
* Anne's mom: 2 grams x 3 brushings = 6 grams
* Anne: 1 gram x 3 brushings = 3 grams
* Anne's brother: 1 gram x 3 brushings = 3 grams
* Total used per day: 9 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 21 grams

Now, we can calculate how many days the toothpaste will last:
* 105 grams / 21 grams per day = 5 days

Answer: 5 days
