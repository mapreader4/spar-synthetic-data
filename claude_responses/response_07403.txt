Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James trains twice a day
* Each training session is 4 hours long
* He trains this way for all but 2 days per week
* We need to calculate the total number of hours he trains in a year

First, let's calculate the number of hours he trains per week:
* 2 training sessions per day x 4 hours per session = 8 hours per day
* 8 hours per day x 5 days per week (since he takes 2 days off) = 40 hours per week

Now, let's calculate the number of hours he trains in a year:
* 40 hours per week x 52 weeks in a year = 2,080 hours per year

Answer: 2,080 hours
