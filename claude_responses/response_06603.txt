Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 8 people that can fit in each row on the airplane.
2) There are 12 rows on the airplane.
3) However, only 3/4 of the seats in each row are allowed to be seated.
4) To calculate the total number of seats on the airplane, we take the number of people per row (8) and multiply it by the number of rows (12): 8 x 12 = 96 total seats.
5) Since only 3/4 of the seats in each row are allowed to be seated, we need to calculate how many seats that is. 3/4 of 8 seats per row is 6 seats per row.
6) With 6 seats per row and 12 rows, the total number of seats that can be occupied is 6 x 12 = 72 seats.
7) To find the number of seats that will not be occupied, we take the total number of seats (96) and subtract the number of seats that can be occupied (72): 96 - 72 = 24 seats.
