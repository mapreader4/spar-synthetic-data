Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) At the beginning of the day, there were 74 apples in the basket.
2) Ricki removes 14 apples from the basket.
3) Samson removes twice as many apples as Ricki, which means Samson removes 2 * 14 = 28 apples.
4) To find the total number of apples removed, we add Ricki's 14 and Samson's 28: 14 + 28 = 42 apples removed.
5) To find the number of apples left in the basket, we subtract the total apples removed from the initial 74 apples: 74 - 42 = 32 apples.

Answer: 32
