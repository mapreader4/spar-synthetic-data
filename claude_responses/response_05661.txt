Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cost of a stack of pancakes is $4.00
* The cost of adding bacon is $2.00
* They sold 60 stacks of pancakes
* They sold 90 slices of bacon

To calculate the total amount raised, we need to:
1. Calculate the total revenue from the pancake stacks:
   * 60 stacks of pancakes x $4.00 per stack = $240.00
2. Calculate the total revenue from the bacon:
   * 90 slices of bacon x $2.00 per slice = $180.00
3. Add the revenue from the pancake stacks and the bacon:
   * $240.00 + $180.00 = $420.00

Answer: $420
