Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total number of students in the class is 400.
2) The number of short students is 2/5 of the total number of students. 
   * 2/5 of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160 short students.
3) The number of tall students is given as 90.
4) To find the number of students with average height, we need to subtract the number of short and tall students from the total number of students.
   * Total students - short students - tall students = average height students
   * 400 - 160 - 90 = 150 students with average height.

Answer: 150
