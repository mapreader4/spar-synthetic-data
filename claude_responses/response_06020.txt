Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carrie buys:
   - 4 shirts at $8 each
   - 2 pairs of pants at $18 each
   - 2 jackets at $60 each
2) To calculate the total cost of the clothes:
   - Cost of 4 shirts: 4 x $8 = $32
   - Cost of 2 pairs of pants: 2 x $18 = $36
   - Cost of 2 jackets: 2 x $60 = $120
   - Total cost of all the clothes: $32 + $36 + $120 = $188
3) Carrie's mom pays for half of the total cost, which is $188 / 2 = $94
4) Therefore, Carrie pays the other half of the total cost, which is $94.

Answer: 94
