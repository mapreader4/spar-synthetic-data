Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack had to wait 20 hours to get through customs
* He also had to spend 14 days in coronavirus quarantine
* To calculate the total time Jack had to wait, we need to convert the 14 days of quarantine into hours
* 14 days = 14 * 24 hours = 336 hours
* Now we can add the 20 hours of customs wait time to the 336 hours of quarantine time
* 20 hours + 336 hours = 356 hours

Answer: 356 hours
