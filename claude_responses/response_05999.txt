Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Luke takes 5 times as many grape jelly beans as vanilla jelly beans.
2) He also takes 50 more than 5 times as many grape jelly beans as vanilla jelly beans.
3) So, the number of grape jelly beans is 5 times the number of vanilla jelly beans, plus 50.
4) We know there are 120 vanilla jelly beans.
5) So, the number of grape jelly beans is 5 * 120 + 50 = 650.
6) The total number of jelly beans is the number of vanilla jelly beans (120) plus the number of grape jelly beans (650).
7) Therefore, the total number of jelly beans is 120 + 650 = 770.

Answer: 770
