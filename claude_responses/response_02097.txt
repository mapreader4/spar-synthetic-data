Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that Ali, Nada, and John have a total of $67 in their wallets.
2) We also know that Ali has $5 less than Nada.
3) And we know that John has 4 times more than Nada.
4) Let's call the amount of money Nada has as "x".
5) Then, Ali has x - $5, and John has 4x.
6) We can set up an equation to solve for x:
   x + (x - $5) + 4x = $67
   6x - $5 = $67
   6x = $72
   x = $12
7) So Nada has $12.
8) Then, Ali has $12 - $5 = $7.
9) And John has 4 * $12 = $48.

Answer: $48
