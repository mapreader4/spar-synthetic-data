Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tyrone has 2 $1 bills, which is 2 x $1 = $2
* Tyrone has 1 $5 bill, which is $5
* Tyrone has 13 quarters, which is 13 x $0.25 = $3.25
* Tyrone has 20 dimes, which is 20 x $0.10 = $2.00
* Tyrone has 8 nickels, which is 8 x $0.05 = $0.40
* Tyrone has 35 pennies, which is 35 x $0.01 = $0.35

Now, we add up all the amounts:
$2 + $5 + $3.25 + $2.00 + $0.40 + $0.35 = $13.00

Answer: $13
