Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The store made 50 posters in total
* Two-fifths of the 50 posters are small posters
* To calculate the number of small posters:
    - Two-fifths of 50 = 2/5 * 50 = 20 small posters
* Half of the 50 posters are medium posters
    - Half of 50 = 1/2 * 50 = 25 medium posters
* The rest of the posters are large posters
    - Total posters = 50
    - Small posters = 20
    - Medium posters = 25
    - Large posters = 50 - 20 - 25 = 5 large posters

Answer: 5
