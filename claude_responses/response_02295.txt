Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* There were 123 students who attended the prom
* 3 students attended on their own
* The remaining students must have attended in couples
* To find the number of couples, we need to subtract the 3 students who attended on their own from the total number of students, and then divide the result by 2 (since each couple has 2 people)
* 123 - 3 = 120 students who attended in couples
* 120 / 2 = 60 couples

Answer: 60
