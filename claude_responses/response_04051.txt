Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The friends ordered:
  - 1 platter of Taco Salad at $10
  - 5 orders of Dave's Single hamburger at $5 each, so 5 x $5 = $25
  - 4 sets of french fries at $2.50 each, so 4 x $2.50 = $10
  - 5 cups of peach lemonade at $2 each, so 5 x $2 = $10
* To calculate the total bill, we add up all the items:
  - $10 + $25 + $10 + $10 = $55
* Since there are 5 friends, to split the bill equally, we divide the total bill by 5:
  - $55 / 5 = $11
