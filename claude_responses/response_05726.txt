Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6.
2) The total amount of money they have is $75.
3) To find the individual amounts, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.
4) Cara's share = 4/15 * $75 = $20
5) Janet's share = 5/15 * $75 = $25
6) Jerry's share = 6/15 * $75 = $30
7) If Cara and Janet combine their money to buy oranges, they have $20 + $25 = $45.
8) They sell the oranges at 80% of the buying price, so they get 0.8 * $45 = $36.
9) The loss they make is the difference between the buying price ($45) and the selling price ($36), which is $45 - $36 = $9.

Answer: $9
