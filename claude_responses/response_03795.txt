Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Natasha was going 10 mph over the speed limit.
2) We also know that it took her 1 hour to travel 60 miles.
3) To find the speed limit, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time
4) Since the time taken was 1 hour, we can rearrange the formula to: Speed = Distance / Time
5) Plugging in the values we know, we get: Speed = 60 miles / 1 hour = 60 mph
6) Since Natasha was going 10 mph over the speed limit, the speed limit must have been 60 mph - 10 mph = 50 mph.

Answer: 50
