Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* An order of Chicken Pasta uses 2 pieces of chicken
* Victor has 6 Chicken Pasta orders
* So for the Chicken Pasta orders, he needs:
  * 6 orders x 2 pieces per order = 12 pieces of chicken
* An order of Barbecue Chicken uses 3 pieces of chicken
* Victor has 3 Barbecue Chicken orders
* So for the Barbecue Chicken orders, he needs:
  * 3 orders x 3 pieces per order = 9 pieces of chicken
* A family-size Fried Chicken Dinner uses 8 pieces of chicken
* Victor has 2 Fried Chicken Dinner orders
* So for the Fried Chicken Dinner orders, he needs:
  * 2 orders x 8 pieces per order = 16 pieces of chicken
* To calculate the total pieces of chicken needed, we add up the pieces needed for each order type:
  * 12 + 9 + 16 = 37 pieces of chicken
