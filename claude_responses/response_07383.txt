Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* There are 9 boys and 12 girls in the class
* The teacher needs to create groups with three members each
* To find the total number of groups, we need to find the total number of students and divide it by the number of members per group
* The total number of students is 9 boys + 12 girls = 21 students
* Dividing the total number of students (21) by the number of members per group (3), we get:
21 students / 3 members per group = 7 groups

Answer: 7
