Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made structure on earth for almost 4000 years.
* It is 20 feet taller than 500 feet.
* This means the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza is 500 feet + 20 feet = 520 feet.
* It is 234 feet wider than it is tall.
* Since the height is 520 feet, the width of the Great Pyramid of Giza is 520 feet + 234 feet = 754 feet.
* To find the sum of the height and width, we add 520 feet and 754 feet:
* 520 feet + 754 feet = 1274 feet.

Answer: 1274
