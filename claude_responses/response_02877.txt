Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

For the first route:
* Total distance: 1500 miles
* Average speed: 75 MPH

To find the time for the first route, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1500 miles / 75 MPH
Time = 20 hours

For the second route:
* Total distance: 750 miles
* Average speed: 25 MPH

To find the time for the second route, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 750 miles / 25 MPH
Time = 30 hours

Since the first route has a faster average speed, it is the fastest route.

Answer: 20 hours
