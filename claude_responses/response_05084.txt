Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Haji's mother sells goods worth $800 on a tough week
* This is half the amount she sells on a good week
* So, on a good week, she sells goods worth $800 x 2 = $1,600
* She has 5 good weeks and 3 tough weeks
* For the 5 good weeks, she makes 5 x $1,600 = $8,000
* For the 3 tough weeks, she makes 3 x $800 = $2,400
* To get the total amount of money she makes, we add the amounts from the good weeks and tough weeks:
* $8,000 + $2,400 = $10,400

Answer: 10400
