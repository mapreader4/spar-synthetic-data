Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day
* She practices the violin for three times as long as the piano, which is 3 x 20 = 60 minutes a day
* So, in total, she practices for 20 + 60 = 80 minutes a day
* She practices 6 days a week
* So, in a week, she practices for 80 x 6 = 480 minutes
* There are 4 weeks in a month
* Therefore, in a month, she practices for 480 x 4 = 1,920 minutes

Answer: 1,920
