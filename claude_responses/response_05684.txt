Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 kindergartner groups
* The first group has 9 students
* The second group has 10 students
* The third group has 11 students
* Each student needs to bring 1 mini tissue box
* Each mini tissue box contains 40 tissues

To find the total number of tissues brought by the kindergartner groups, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of students across all 3 groups
2. Multiply the total number of students by the number of tissues per mini tissue box

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students
* 9 students + 10 students + 11 students = 30 total students

Step 2: Multiply the total number of students by the number of tissues per mini tissue box
* 30 students x 40 tissues per box = 1,200 tissues

Answer: 1,200
