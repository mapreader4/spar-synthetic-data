Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The regular ticket costs $9
* The ticket for children is $2 less, so it costs $7
* The family gave the cashier two $20 bills, which is a total of $40
* They received $1 in change, so the total cost of the tickets was $39
* We know there are 2 adults in the family, so the number of children is the unknown variable we need to solve for

To find the number of children, we can set up an equation:
* 2 x $9 (adult tickets) + x x $7 (children tickets) = $39
* Where x is the number of children

Solving this equation:
* 2 x $9 = $18
* x x $7 = $39 - $18 = $21
* x = $21 / $7 = 3

Therefore, the number of children in the family is 3.
