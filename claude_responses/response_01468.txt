Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Troy's home is 75 meters away from school
* Emily's home is 98 meters away from school
* They both walk to school and back home every day
* We need to find how much farther Emily walks in 5 days

To calculate the total distance walked by each person in 5 days:
* Troy walks 75 meters to school and 75 meters back home, which is a total of 150 meters per day
* In 5 days, Troy walks a total of 150 meters x 5 days = 750 meters

* Emily walks 98 meters to school and 98 meters back home, which is a total of 196 meters per day
* In 5 days, Emily walks a total of 196 meters x 5 days = 980 meters

To find the difference in distance walked:
* Emily walks 980 meters in 5 days
* Troy walks 750 meters in 5 days
* The difference is 980 meters - 750 meters = 230 meters

Answer: 230
