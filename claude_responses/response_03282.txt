Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark was born in January 1976
* It's February 2021, so Mark's current age is:
    * 2021 - 1976 = 45 years old
* Graham is 3 years younger than Mark
* So Graham's age is:
    * 45 - 3 = 42 years old
* Janice is 1/2 the age of Graham
* So Janice's age is:
    * 42 / 2 = 21 years old

Answer: 21
