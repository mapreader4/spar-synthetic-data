Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wendi's plot of land is 200 feet by 900 feet.
2) To convert this to square yards, we need to divide the length and width by 3 (since 1 yard = 3 feet).
3) 200 feet / 3 = 66.67 yards
4) 900 feet / 3 = 300 yards
5) The total area of the grassland is 66.67 yards x 300 yards = 20,000 square yards.
6) Each rabbit can clear 10 square yards of grass per day.
7) Wendi has 100 rabbits.
8) So the total area cleared per day is 100 rabbits x 10 square yards per rabbit = 1,000 square yards per day.
9) To calculate how many days it would take to clear the entire 20,000 square yard plot, we divide 20,000 by 1,000:
20,000 square yards / 1,000 square yards per day = 20 days.

Answer: 20 days.
