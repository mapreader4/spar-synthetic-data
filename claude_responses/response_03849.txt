Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Randy had some amount of money at first.
2. He spent $10 on his lunch.
3. He then spent a quarter of the remaining money on an ice cream cone that cost $5.

Let's call the initial amount of money Randy had as "x" dollars.

After spending $10 on his lunch, he had (x - 10) dollars left.

He then spent a quarter of that, which is (x - 10) / 4 = $5 on the ice cream cone.

We know the ice cream cone cost $5, so we can set up an equation:
(x - 10) / 4 = 5
Solving for x, we get:
x - 10 = 20
x = 30

Answer: $30
