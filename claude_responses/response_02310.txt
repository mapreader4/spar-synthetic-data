Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Selena's book has 400 pages.
2) Harry's book has 20 fewer than half the number of pages Selena's book has.
3) To find half the number of pages in Selena's book, we divide 400 by 2, which is 200.
4) Now, we subtract 20 from 200 to get the number of pages in Harry's book.
5) 200 - 20 = 180.

Answer: 180
