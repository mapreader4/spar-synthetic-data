Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Liz originally paid for her old car. Let's call this amount X.
2) She sold the old car for 80% of X, which is 0.8X.
3) She needs $4,000 to buy the new $30,000 car.
4) So the amount she got from selling the old car (0.8X) plus the $4,000 she needs is equal to the cost of the new car ($30,000).
5) 0.8X + $4,000 = $30,000
6) Solving for X, we get:
X = ($30,000 - $4,000) / 0.8
X = $32,500
7) The difference between what Liz originally paid for the old car ($32,500) and the new car ($30,000) is:
$32,500 - $30,000 = $2,500

Answer: $2,500
