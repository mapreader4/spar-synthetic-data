Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia.
   * Let's say Julia has x video games.
   * Then Theresa has 3x + 5 video games.
2) Julia has a third as many video games as Tory.
   * Tory has 6 video games.
   * So Julia has 6 / 3 = 2 video games.
   * Therefore, x = 2.
3) Plugging in the value for Julia, we can calculate Theresa's video games:
   * Theresa has 3x + 5 = 3(2) + 5 = 11 video games.

Answer: 11
