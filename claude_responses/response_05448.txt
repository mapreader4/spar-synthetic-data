To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of running for each person and then calculate the difference in the distance they ran per hour.

Given information:
- Jim ran 16 miles in 2 hours.
- Frank ran 20 miles in 2 hours.

Step 1: Find the rate of running for Jim.
Jim's rate of running = Distance / Time
Jim's rate of running = 16 miles / 2 hours = 8 miles per hour

Step 2: Find the rate of running for Frank.
Frank's rate of running = Distance / Time
Frank's rate of running = 20 miles / 2 hours = 10 miles per hour

Step 3: Calculate the difference in the distance they ran per hour.
Difference in distance per hour = Frank's rate - Jim's rate
Difference in distance per hour = 10 miles per hour - 8 miles per hour = 2 miles per hour

Answer: 2 miles
