Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* McKenna has 34 stuffed animals
* Kenley has twice as many stuffed animals as McKenna
* To find how many stuffed animals Kenley has, we multiply McKenna's 34 by 2:
  * Kenley has 34 x 2 = 68 stuffed animals
* Tenly has 5 more stuffed animals than Kenley
* To find how many stuffed animals Tenly has, we add 5 to Kenley's 68:
  * Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals
* To find the total number of stuffed animals the three girls have, we add up their individual amounts:
  * McKenna has 34
  * Kenley has 68
  * Tenly has 73
  * 34 + 68 + 73 = 175

Answer: 175
