Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Joel is currently 5 years old
* His dad is currently 32 years old
* We need to find out how old Joel will be when his dad is twice as old as him

To do this, we need to find out how old Joel's dad will be when he is twice as old as Joel.

* Joel's dad is currently 32 years old
* When Joel's dad is twice as old as Joel, he will be 2 * Joel's age
* So, we need to find out how many years it will take for Joel's dad to be 2 * Joel's age

Let's set up an equation:
* Joel's dad's age = 2 * Joel's age
* 32 + x = 2 * (5 + x)
* 32 + x = 10 + 2x
* x = 10
* Joel's dad will be 32 + 10 = 42 years old

Therefore, when Joel's dad is 42 years old, he will be twice as old as Joel.

So, the answer is:
Answer: 12
