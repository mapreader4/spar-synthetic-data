Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jorge has 60 acres of property
* 1/3 of the 60 acres is clay-rich soil, which means 2/3 of the 60 acres is good soil
* Corn grown on good soil yields 400 bushels per acre
* Corn grown on clay-rich soil yields half as much per acre as in good soil, which is 200 bushels per acre

Now, let's calculate the total yield:
* Good soil: 2/3 of 60 acres = 40 acres
* Yield on good soil: 40 acres x 400 bushels/acre = 16,000 bushels
* Clay-rich soil: 1/3 of 60 acres = 20 acres
* Yield on clay-rich soil: 20 acres x 200 bushels/acre = 4,000 bushels
* Total yield: 16,000 bushels + 4,000 bushels = 20,000 bushels

Answer: 20,000 bushels
