Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom can type 90 words per minute
* A page is 450 words
* We need to find how long it would take him to type out 10 pages

First, we need to find how long it would take him to type one page:
* 450 words per page / 90 words per minute = 5 minutes per page

Now, to find the total time to type out 10 pages:
* 10 pages x 5 minutes per page = 50 minutes

Therefore, it would take Tom 50 minutes to type out 10 pages.

Answer: 50
