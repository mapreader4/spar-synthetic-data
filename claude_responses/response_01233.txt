Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kevin ran at 10 miles per hour for half an hour. So, in the first half hour, he ran 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 5 miles.
2) Then, he ran at 20 miles per hour for half an hour. So, in the second half hour, he ran 20 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 10 miles.
3) Finally, he ran at 8 miles per hour for 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours. So, in the last 15 minutes, he ran 8 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = 2 miles.
4) Adding up the distances from each segment:
5 miles + 10 miles + 2 miles = 17 miles.

Answer: 17 miles
