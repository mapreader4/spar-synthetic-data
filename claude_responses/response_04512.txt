Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Fantasy books cost $4 each
* Literature books cost half the price of a fantasy book, which is $2 each
* Vincent sold 5 fantasy books and 8 literature books per day
* We need to calculate the total earnings over 5 days

First, let's calculate the daily earnings:
* Daily earnings from fantasy books: 5 books x $4 = $20
* Daily earnings from literature books: 8 books x $2 = $16
* Total daily earnings: $20 + $16 = $36

Now, let's calculate the total earnings over 5 days:
* Total earnings = Daily earnings x 5 days
* Total earnings = $36 x 5 = $180

Answer: $180
