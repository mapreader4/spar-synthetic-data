Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The bakery made 95 muffins.
2) Each box can hold 5 muffins.
3) There are only 10 available boxes.
4) To calculate the number of boxes needed, we need to divide the total number of muffins by the number of muffins per box.
5) 95 muffins / 5 muffins per box = 19 boxes needed.
6) However, there are only 10 available boxes, so they still need 9 more boxes to pack all the muffins.
