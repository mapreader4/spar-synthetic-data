Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first round, Hattie did 180 jumps.
2. Lorelei jumped 3/4 as many times as Hattie, so Lorelei did 3/4 * 180 = 135 jumps in the first round.
3. In the second round, Lorelei did 50 more jumps than Hattie.
4. Hattie did 2/3 times the number of jumps she did in the first round, so Hattie did 2/3 * 180 = 120 jumps in the second round.
5. Therefore, Lorelei did 120 + 50 = 170 jumps in the second round.

Now, let's calculate the total number of jumps the two did in the two rounds:
Total jumps = Hattie's jumps in round 1 + Lorelei's jumps in round 1 + Hattie's jumps in round 2 + Lorelei's jumps in round 2
Total jumps = 180 + 135 + 120 + 170 = 605

Answer: 605
