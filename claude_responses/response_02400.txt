Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexander buys 5 apples at $1 each
* So the total cost of the apples is 5 x $1 = $5
* He also buys 2 oranges at $2 each
* So the total cost of the oranges is 2 x $2 = $4
* To calculate the total amount Alexander spends, we add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges:
* $5 + $4 = $9
