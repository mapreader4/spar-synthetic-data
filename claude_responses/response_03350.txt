Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry currently drinks 48 sodas per week
* He wants to cut the number of sodas he drinks in half each week
* We need to find out how many weeks it will take for him to reach 6 sodas per week

Let's start with the first week:
* Jerry drinks 48 sodas per week
* If he cuts the number in half, he will drink 24 sodas in the first week

Now, the second week:
* Jerry drank 24 sodas the previous week
* If he cuts the number in half again, he will drink 12 sodas in the second week

Continuing this pattern:
* Third week: 12 sodas
* Fourth week: 6 sodas

So, it will take Jerry 4 weeks to reach his goal of 6 sodas per week.
