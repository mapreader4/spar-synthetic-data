Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The team has 3 goalies and 10 defenders
* The team has twice as many midfielders as defenders
* The remaining players are strikers

First, let's calculate the number of midfielders:
* The team has twice as many midfielders as defenders
* So, the number of midfielders is 2 x 10 = 20

Now, we can calculate the total number of players that are not strikers:
* 3 goalies + 10 defenders + 20 midfielders = 33 players

Finally, we can calculate the number of strikers:
* The team has 40 players total
* The number of non-strikers is 33
* So, the number of strikers is 40 - 33 = 7

Answer: 7
