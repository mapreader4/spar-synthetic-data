Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Matt worked for 450 minutes.
* On Tuesday, he worked half the number of minutes he worked on Monday.
* So, on Tuesday, he worked for 450 / 2 = 225 minutes.
* On Wednesday, he worked for 300 minutes.
* To find the difference between the number of minutes he worked on Wednesday and Tuesday, we subtract:
* 300 minutes (Wednesday) - 225 minutes (Tuesday) = 75 minutes.

Answer: 75
