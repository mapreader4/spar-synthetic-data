Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Remi's water bottle holds 20 ounces of water
* He refills the bottle 3 times a day
* He drinks the whole bottle each time, except for 2 times when he spills some
* The first time he spilled 5 ounces
* The second time he spilled 8 ounces
* We want to know how many ounces of water he drinks in 7 days

First, let's calculate how much water he drinks per day:
* 3 refills per day x 20 ounces per refill = 60 ounces per day
* Minus the 2 times he spilled: 60 - 5 - 8 = 47 ounces per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water he drinks in 7 days:
* 47 ounces per day x 7 days = 329 ounces

Answer: 329 ounces
