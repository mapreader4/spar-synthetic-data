Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mcgregor and Floyd were assigned 89 books to read for the week.
2) Mcgregor was able to finish 34 books.
3) Floyd was able to finish 32 books.
4) To find the number of books they still have to read, we need to subtract the number of books they finished from the total number of books assigned.
5) The total number of books they finished is 34 + 32 = 66.
6) The number of books they still have to read is 89 - 66 = 23.

Answer: 23
