Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* David started the day with 14 Samsung cell phones
* He ended the day with 10 Samsung cell phones
* This means he sold 4 Samsung cell phones (14 - 10 = 4)
* He started the day with 8 iPhones
* He ended the day with 5 iPhones
* This means he sold 3 iPhones (8 - 5 = 3)
* His staff threw out 2 damaged Samsung cell phones and 1 iPhone with a defect
* So the total number of cell phones sold today is:
* 4 Samsung cell phones + 3 iPhones = 7 cell phones
