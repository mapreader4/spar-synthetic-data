Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Courtney's first jar has 80 marbles.
2. Her second jar has twice the amount of the first jar, which means it has 2 x 80 = 160 marbles.
3. Her third jar has 1/4 the amount of the first jar, which means it has 1/4 x 80 = 20 marbles.

Now, to find the total number of marbles Courtney has, we add up the amounts in each of the three jars:
80 + 160 + 20 = 260 marbles

Answer: 260
