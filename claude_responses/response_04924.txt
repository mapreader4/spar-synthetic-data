Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Diane starts with $100
* She wins 5 hands for a total of $65
* So, her total amount of money after the wins is $100 + $65 = $165
* However, she then loses all of her money and ends up owing her friends $50
* To calculate the total amount of money she lost, we need to add the $165 she had after the wins to the $50 she ended up owing
* $165 + $50 = $215

Answer: $215
