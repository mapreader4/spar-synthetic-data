Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ruby has 6 math homework and 2 reading homework
* Nina has 4 times more math homework than Ruby
* Nina has 8 times more reading homework than Ruby

First, let's calculate Nina's math homework:
* Ruby has 6 math homework
* Nina has 4 times more math homework than Ruby
* So, Nina's math homework = 4 x 6 = 24

Next, let's calculate Nina's reading homework:
* Ruby has 2 reading homework
* Nina has 8 times more reading homework than Ruby
* So, Nina's reading homework = 8 x 2 = 16

Now, to find the total homework Nina has, we add her math homework and reading homework:
* Nina's total homework = 24 + 16 = 40

Answer: 40
