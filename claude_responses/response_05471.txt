Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Diana did 40 situps at a rate of 4 situps per minute, so it took her 10 minutes to do 40 situps.
2) Hani said she would do 3 more situps per minute than Diana, so Hani's rate was 4 + 3 = 7 situps per minute.
3) Since Hani and Diana took the same amount of time (10 minutes), Hani did 7 * 10 = 70 situps.
4) The total number of situps they did together is the sum of Diana's situps and Hani's situps:
40 + 70 = 110 situps.

Answer: 110
