Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The high school football field is measured in square meters
* Each square meter needs three times as much seed as fertilizer
* Carson uses 60 gallons of seed and fertilizer combined

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of gallons of seed used
* Let y = the number of gallons of fertilizer used

We know that the total amount of seed and fertilizer used is 60 gallons, so:
* x + y = 60

We also know that each square meter needs three times as much seed as fertilizer, so:
* x = 3y

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
* 3y + y = 60
* 4y = 60
* y = 15

Now, we can solve for x:
* x = 3y
* x = 3(15)
* x = 45

Therefore, the amount of seed used by Carson is:
Answer: 45 gallons
