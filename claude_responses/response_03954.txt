Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jesse first built a building with 80 building blocks
* Then he built a farmhouse with 123 building blocks
* Next, he added a fenced-in area with 57 building blocks
* So the total number of building blocks used so far is:
    - Building: 80 blocks
    - Farmhouse: 123 blocks
    - Fenced-in area: 57 blocks
    - Total: 80 + 123 + 57 = 260 blocks
* Jesse has 84 building blocks left
* To find the total number of building blocks Jesse started with, we add the 260 blocks he used to the 84 blocks he has left:
    - 260 + 84 = 344 building blocks

Answer: 344
