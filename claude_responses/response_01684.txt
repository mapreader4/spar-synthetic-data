Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first week, 15 bags of chips were sold.
* In the second week, thrice as many bags of chips were sold, which means 3 x 15 = 45 bags of chips were sold.
* The total number of bags of chips sold in the first two weeks is 15 + 45 = 60 bags.
* The remaining 100 - 60 = 40 bags of chips were sold in the third and fourth weeks.
* Since there was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week, we can divide the remaining 40 bags by 2 to get the number of bags sold in each of the third and fourth weeks.
* 40 รท 2 = 20 bags of chips were sold in each of the third and fourth weeks.

Answer: 20
