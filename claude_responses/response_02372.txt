Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Smith has 2 adults (himself and his wife)
* Mr. Smith has 2 senior citizens (his parents)
* Mr. Smith has 3 children
* The adult buffet price is $30 per person
* The children's buffet price is $15 per child
* Senior citizens get a 10% discount on the adult buffet price

First, let's calculate the cost for the 2 adult buffets:
* 2 adults x $30 per adult = $60

Next, let's calculate the cost for the 2 senior citizen buffets with the 10% discount:
* 2 seniors x $30 per adult = $60
* 10% discount on $60 = $6 discount
* $60 - $6 = $54

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the 3 children's buffets:
* 3 children x $15 per child = $45

Now we can add up the total cost:
* $60 (2 adult buffets) + $54 (2 senior buffets) + $45 (3 children's buffets) = $159

Answer: $159
