Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. The total cost of the tablet on the installment plan is:
   * Down payment: $100
   * 4 months at $40 per month: $40 x 4 = $160
   * 4 months at $35 per month: $35 x 4 = $140
   * 4 months at $30 per month: $30 x 4 = $120
   * Total installment cost: $100 + $160 + $140 + $120 = $520

2. The cash price of the tablet is $450.

3. To calculate the amount Loisa will save by buying the tablet in cash instead of on installment, we need to subtract the cash price from the total installment cost:
   * Amount saved = $520 - $450 = $70

Answer: $70
