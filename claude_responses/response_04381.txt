Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Danny has 3 picnic blankets, and each one has an area of 8 x 8 when unfolded.
2) The area of each unfolded blanket is 8 x 8 = 64 square feet.
3) The total area of the 3 unfolded blankets is 3 x 64 = 192 square feet.
4) The total area of the folded blankets is 48 square feet.
5) To find how many times Danny folded the blankets, we divide the total unfolded area by the total folded area:
192 square feet / 48 square feet = 4 times.
