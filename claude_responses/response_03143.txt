Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Amy has 5 chocolate bars.
2) She has 7 times as many M&Ms as chocolate bars. So, she has 7 x 5 = 35 M&Ms.
3) She has 6 times as many marshmallows as M&Ms. So, she has 6 x 35 = 210 marshmallows.
4) In total, Amy has 5 chocolate bars + 35 M&Ms + 210 marshmallows = 250 candies.
5) Each basket is filled with 10 candies.
6) To find the number of baskets, we divide the total number of candies by the number of candies per basket:
250 candies / 10 candies per basket = 25 baskets.

Answer: 25
