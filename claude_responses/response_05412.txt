Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 30 players on the football team.
2) The coach has 8 liters of water.
3) The coach pours 200 milliliters of water for every player.
4) 200 milliliters x 30 players = 6,000 milliliters of water used.
5) There was a water spill of 250 milliliters.
6) To find the amount of water left over, we need to subtract the amount of water used (6,000 ml) and the amount of water spilled (250 ml) from the total amount of water (8,000 ml).
7) 8,000 ml - 6,000 ml - 250 ml = 1,750 ml.

Answer: 1,750
