Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A soccer ball takes 20 minutes to inflate
* Alexia is inflating 20 balls
* Ermias is inflating 5 more balls than Alexia, so Ermias is inflating 25 balls
* To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for Alexia and Ermias separately, then add them together

For Alexia:
* Alexia is inflating 20 balls
* Each ball takes 20 minutes to inflate
* So the total time for Alexia is 20 balls x 20 minutes = 400 minutes

For Ermias:
* Ermias is inflating 25 balls
* Each ball takes 20 minutes to inflate
* So the total time for Ermias is 25 balls x 20 minutes = 500 minutes

Now we add the total time for Alexia and Ermias:
* Total time = 400 minutes + 500 minutes = 900 minutes

Answer: 900
