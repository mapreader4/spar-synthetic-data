Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carl sold watermelons for $3 each
* He went home with $105 in profit
* He also had 18 watermelons left unsold
* To find the total number of watermelons he started with, we need to add the number of watermelons he sold to the 18 he had left
* To find the number of watermelons he sold, we can divide the $105 profit by the $3 price per watermelon:
* $105 profit / $3 per watermelon = 35 watermelons sold
* Now we add the 18 watermelons he had left to the 35 he sold:
* 35 watermelons sold + 18 watermelons left = 53 watermelons total

Answer: 53
