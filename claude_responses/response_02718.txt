Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each trumpet and clarinet player carries 5 pounds of weight
* There are 6 trumpets and 9 clarinets
* So the total weight carried by the trumpets and clarinets is:
  - 6 trumpets x 5 pounds = 30 pounds
  - 9 clarinets x 5 pounds = 45 pounds
  - Total weight for trumpets and clarinets = 30 + 45 = 75 pounds
* Each trombone player carries 10 pounds of weight
* There are 8 trombones
* So the total weight carried by the trombones is:
  - 8 trombones x 10 pounds = 80 pounds
* Each tuba player carries 20 pounds of weight
* There are 3 tubas
* So the total weight carried by the tubas is:
  - 3 tubas x 20 pounds = 60 pounds
* Each drummer carries 15 pounds of weight
* There are 2 drummers
* So the total weight carried by the drummers is:
  - 2 drummers x 15 pounds = 30 pounds
* To get the total weight carried by the entire marching band, we add up the weights:
  - 75 + 80 + 60 + 30 = 245 pounds
