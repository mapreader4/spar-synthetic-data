Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bowl holds 150 ml total.
2) The bowl is filled 2/3rds with oil and 1/3rd with vinegar.
   * 2/3 of 150 ml = 100 ml of oil
   * 1/3 of 150 ml = 50 ml of vinegar
3) The oil weighs 5 g/ml, so the weight of the oil is:
   * 100 ml x 5 g/ml = 500 g
4) The vinegar weighs 4 g/ml, so the weight of the vinegar is:
   * 50 ml x 4 g/ml = 200 g
5) The total weight of the salad dressing is the sum of the weights of the oil and vinegar:
   * 500 g + 200 g = 700 g

Answer: 700
