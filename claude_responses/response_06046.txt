Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ellen's daily calorie target is 2,200 calories
* For breakfast, she ate 353 calories
* For lunch, she had 885 calories
* For her afternoon snack, she had 130 calories
* To calculate the calories left for dinner, we need to add up the calories she has consumed so far and subtract that from her daily target:
* Calories consumed so far = 353 + 885 + 130 = 1,368 calories
* Calories left for dinner = 2,200 - 1,368 = 832 calories

Answer: 832 calories
