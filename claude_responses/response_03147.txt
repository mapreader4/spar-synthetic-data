Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each parakeet eats 2 grams a day
* Peter has 3 parakeets
* So the total amount of birdseed needed for the parakeets per day is:
  * 3 parakeets x 2 grams per day = 6 grams per day
* Each parrot eats 14 grams a day
* Peter has 2 parrots
* So the total amount of birdseed needed for the parrots per day is:
  * 2 parrots x 14 grams per day = 28 grams per day
* Each finch eats half of what a parakeet eats, which is 1 gram per day
* Peter has 4 finches
* So the total amount of birdseed needed for the finches per day is:
  * 4 finches x 1 gram per day = 4 grams per day
* To calculate the total amount of birdseed needed per day, we add up the amounts for the parakeets, parrots, and finches:
  * 6 grams + 28 grams + 4 grams = 38 grams per day
* Peter needs to buy enough birdseed to last a week, which is 7 days
* So the total amount of birdseed Peter needs to buy is:
  * 38 grams per day x 7 days = 266 grams

Answer: 266
