Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Giselle had 20 female doves in the birdhouse.
2) Each dove laid 3 eggs, so the total number of eggs laid is 20 * 3 = 60 eggs.
3) 3/4 of the eggs hatched, so the number of eggs that hatched is 60 * 3/4 = 45 eggs.
4) The original 20 female doves are still there, and the 45 eggs that hatched are now doves.
5) Therefore, the total number of doves Giselle has now is 20 + 45 = 65 doves.

Answer: 65
