Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The math test has 75 problems
* After 20 minutes, Georgia has completed 10 problems
* After another 20 minutes (40 minutes total), she has completed twice as many problems, which is 20 problems
* She has 40 minutes left to complete the rest of the test

Now, let's calculate how many problems she has left to solve:
* Total problems: 75
* Problems completed so far: 20
* Problems left to solve: 75 - 20 = 55

Answer: 55
