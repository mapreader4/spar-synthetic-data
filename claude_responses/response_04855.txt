Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Danny drives 8 miles to the first friend's house.
2) From the first friend's house, he drives half the distance, which is 4 miles, to the second friend's house.
3) The total distance driven so far is 8 miles + 4 miles = 12 miles.
4) From the second friend's house, Danny drives 3 times the total distance driven so far, which is 3 * 12 miles = 36 miles, to get to work.

Therefore, the distance Danny drives between the second friend's house and work is 36 miles.

Answer: 36
