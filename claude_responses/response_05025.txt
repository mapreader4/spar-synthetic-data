Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For the first applicant:
- Salary: $42,000
- Revenue generated: $93,000
- Training cost: $1,200 per month for 3 months = $3,600
- Net profit for the company = $93,000 - $42,000 - $3,600 = $47,400

For the second applicant:
- Salary: $45,000
- Hiring bonus: 1% of $45,000 = $450
- Revenue generated: $92,000
- Net profit for the company = $92,000 - $45,000 - $450 = $46,550

Now, to find the difference in net profit between the two candidates:
- Net profit for the first applicant: $47,400
- Net profit for the second applicant: $46,550
- Difference in net profit: $47,400 - $46,550 = $850

Answer: $850
