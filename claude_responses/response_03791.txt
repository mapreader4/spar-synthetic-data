Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Susan earned $600 from babysitting over the summer.
2) She spent half of that on clothes. So, she spent $600 / 2 = $300 on clothes.
3) She had $600 - $300 = $300 left after buying clothes.
4) She then spent half of the remaining $300 on books. So, she spent $300 / 2 = $150 on books.
5) She had $300 - $150 = $150 left after buying the books.

Answer: $150
