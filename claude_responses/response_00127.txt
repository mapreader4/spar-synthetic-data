Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first cat meowed 3 times per minute
* The second cat meowed twice as frequently as the first cat, so it meowed 6 times per minute (2 x 3)
* The third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat, so it meowed 2 times per minute (6 / 3)
* We want to find the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes

To calculate the total number of meows:
* First cat: 3 meows per minute x 5 minutes = 15 meows
* Second cat: 6 meows per minute x 5 minutes = 30 meows
* Third cat: 2 meows per minute x 5 minutes = 10 meows

Now we add up the total meows from all three cats:
* 15 + 30 + 10 = 55 meows

Answer: 55
