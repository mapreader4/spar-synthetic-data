Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Earl has $90 initially
* Earl owes Fred $28, so Earl's new amount is $90 - $28 = $62
* Fred has $48 initially
* Fred receives $28 from Earl, so Fred's new amount is $48 + $28 = $76
* Fred owes Greg $32, so Fred's new amount is $76 - $32 = $44
* Greg has $36 initially
* Greg receives $32 from Fred, so Greg's new amount is $36 + $32 = $68
* Greg owes Earl $40, so Greg's new amount is $68 - $40 = $28

Now, to find the total amount that Greg and Earl have together:
* Earl has $62
* Greg has $28
* Total amount = $62 + $28 = $90

Answer: 90
