Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeff's coach required him to swim 98 laps over the weekend
* On Saturday, Jeff swam 27 laps
* On Sunday morning, he swam 15 laps
* To find the number of laps remaining when he took the break, we need to subtract the laps he has already swam from the total laps required

First, let's calculate the total number of laps he has swam so far:
* Laps on Saturday: 27
* Laps on Sunday morning: 15
* Total laps swam: 27 + 15 = 42

Now, we can subtract the total laps swam from the total laps required:
* Total laps required: 98
* Total laps swam: 42
* Laps remaining: 98 - 42 = 56

Answer: 56
