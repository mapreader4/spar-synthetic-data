Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The elephant weighs 3 tons, which is 3 x 2000 = 6000 pounds.
2) The donkey weighs 90% less than the elephant. This means the donkey weighs 10% of the elephant's weight.
3) 10% of 6000 pounds is 0.1 x 6000 = 600 pounds.
4) The combined weight of the elephant and the donkey is 6000 pounds + 600 pounds = 6600 pounds.

Answer: 6600 pounds.
