Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, Billy runs 1 mile each day, so that's 3 miles.
   Tiffany runs 2 miles each day, so that's 6 miles.
   The total miles for the first 3 days:
   Billy: 3 miles
   Tiffany: 6 miles

2. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, Billy runs 1 mile each day, so that's 3 more miles.
   Tiffany runs 1/3 of a mile each day, so that's 1 mile total.
   The total miles for the last 3 days:
   Billy: 3 miles
   Tiffany: 1 mile

3. Now, we need to find the total miles for each of them:
   Billy: 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles
   Tiffany: 6 miles + 1 mile = 7 miles

4. Tiffany takes Saturday off, so she has a total of 7 miles.
   Billy needs to run enough miles on Saturday to tie Tiffany's total of 7 miles.

Answer: 1 mile
