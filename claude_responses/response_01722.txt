Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. For the first 3 kilometers, Skye's speed was 150 kilometers per hour.
2. For the next 2 kilometers, his speed was 50 kilometers per hour more than the first 3 kilometers, so his speed was 150 + 50 = 200 kilometers per hour.
3. For the remaining 1 kilometer, his speed was twice as fast as his speed on the first 3 kilometers, so his speed was 2 * 150 = 300 kilometers per hour.

Now, to calculate the average speed for the entire race, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the distance by the time.

Total distance traveled = 3 km + 2 km + 1 km = 6 km

Total time taken:
* First 3 km at 150 km/h: 3 km / 150 km/h = 0.02 hours
* Next 2 km at 200 km/h: 2 km / 200 km/h = 0.01 hours
* Last 1 km at 300 km/h: 1 km / 300 km/h = 0.00333 hours

Total time = 0.02 + 0.01 + 0.00333 = 0.03333 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 6 km / 0.03333 hours
= 180 km/h

Answer: 180
