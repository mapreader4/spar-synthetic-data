Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jordan picked 54 mangoes from his tree
* One-third of the mangoes were ripe, and two-thirds were not yet ripe
* To find the number of ripe mangoes:
  - One-third of 54 is 54 รท 3 = 18 ripe mangoes
* To find the number of unripe mangoes:
  - Two-thirds of 54 is 54 ร 2 รท 3 = 36 unripe mangoes
* Jordan kept 16 unripe mangoes, so the remaining unripe mangoes are:
  - 36 - 16 = 20 unripe mangoes
* It takes 4 mangoes to fill a jar
* To find the number of jars of pickled mangoes Jordan's sister can make:
  - 20 unripe mangoes รท 4 mangoes per jar = 5 jars
