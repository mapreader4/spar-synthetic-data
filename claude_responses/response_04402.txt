Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Zach baked 32 cookies.
2. On Tuesday, he could only bake half of the number of cookies he baked the day before. So, he baked 32 / 2 = 16 cookies.
3. On Wednesday, he baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday. So, he baked 16 * 3 = 48 cookies.
4. However, his brother ate 4 of those cookies, so the final number of cookies he had on Wednesday was 48 - 4 = 44 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies he had at the end of the three days:
* Monday: 32 cookies
* Tuesday: 16 cookies
* Wednesday: 44 cookies

Total cookies = 32 + 16 + 44 = 92 cookies

Answer: 92
