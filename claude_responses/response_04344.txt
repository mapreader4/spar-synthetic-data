Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Allie has 9 toys in total, and the total value of the toys is $52.
2) We know that one of the toys is worth $12.
3) The remaining 8 toys must have the same value.
4) Let's call the value of the remaining 8 toys 'x'.
5) The total value of the 9 toys is $52, which can be expressed as:
$12 + 8x = $52
6) Solving for x, we get:
8x = $52 - $12
8x = $40
x = $40 / 8
x = $5
Therefore, the cost of one of the other toys is $5.

Answer: $5
