Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mirasol had $50 in her account.
2) She spent $10 on coffee beans.
3) She spent $30 on a tumbler.
4) To calculate the amount left in her account, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had.
5) The total amount she spent is $10 (on coffee beans) + $30 (on a tumbler) = $40.
6) Subtracting the total amount spent ($40) from the initial amount she had ($50), we get $50 - $40 = $10.
