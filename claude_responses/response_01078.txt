Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 32 tables at the wedding reception
* Each table has a fishbowl with 2 fish, except for one table that has 3 fish
* To find the total number of fish, we need to:
  1. Calculate the number of fish for the 31 tables with 2 fish each
  2. Add the 3 fish from the one table with 3 fish
* Step 1: 31 tables with 2 fish each = 31 * 2 = 62 fish
* Step 2: 1 table with 3 fish = 3 fish
* Total number of fish = 62 + 3 = 65 fish

Answer: 65
