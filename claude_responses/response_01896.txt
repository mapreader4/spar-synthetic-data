Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bruce scored 4 goals
* Michael scored 3 times more than Bruce
* To find how many goals Michael scored, we multiply Bruce's goals by 3:
* 4 goals x 3 = 12 goals
* So, Michael scored 12 goals
* To find the total number of goals scored by both Bruce and Michael, we add their individual scores:
* Bruce's goals: 4
* Michael's goals: 12
* Total goals scored: 4 + 12 = 16

Answer: 16
