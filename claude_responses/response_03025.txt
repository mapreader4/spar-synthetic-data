Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* One crate of vegetables weighs 4 kilograms
* One carton of vegetables weighs 3 kilograms
* The delivery truck is carrying 12 crates and 16 cartons of vegetables
* To calculate the total weight of the load, we need to find the weight of the crates and the weight of the cartons, then add them together.

Weight of the crates:
* 12 crates x 4 kilograms per crate = 48 kilograms

Weight of the cartons:
* 16 cartons x 3 kilograms per carton = 48 kilograms

Total weight of the load:
* 48 kilograms (crates) + 48 kilograms (cartons) = 96 kilograms

Answer: 96 kilograms
