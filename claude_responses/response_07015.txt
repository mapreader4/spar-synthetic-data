Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cassidy will have 6 more posters after this summer, making her collection double the size it was 2 years ago
* 2 years ago, she had 14 posters
* So, the size of her collection 2 years ago was 14 posters
* After this summer, her collection will be double the size it was 2 years ago, which means it will be 2 x 14 = 28 posters
* But she will have 6 more posters after this summer
* So, the number of posters she has now is 28 - 6 = 22 posters

Answer: 22
