Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary has 300 sheep
* Bob has double the number of sheep as Mary, plus another 35
* To find the number of sheep Bob has, we can use the following equation:
    * Bob's sheep = (2 x Mary's sheep) + 35
    * Bob's sheep = (2 x 300) + 35
    * Bob's sheep = 635
* Now, we need to find how many sheep Mary needs to buy to have 69 fewer sheep than Bob
    * Bob has 635 sheep
    * Mary needs to have 69 fewer sheep than Bob
    * So, Mary needs to have 635 - 69 = 566 sheep
    * Mary currently has 300 sheep
    * So, Mary needs to buy 566 - 300 = 266 sheep

Answer: 266
