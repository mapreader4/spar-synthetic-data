Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Philip passed through 5 intersections
* Each intersection had 4 crosswalks
* Each crosswalk had 20 lines
* To calculate the total number of lines, we need to:
  1. Multiply the number of crosswalks per intersection (4) by the number of lines per crosswalk (20)
  2. Multiply that result by the number of intersections (5)
  
Step 1: 4 crosswalks per intersection x 20 lines per crosswalk = 80 lines per intersection
Step 2: 80 lines per intersection x 5 intersections = 400 total lines

Answer: 400
