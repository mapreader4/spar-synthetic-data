Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 14 red crayons.
2) There are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons. So, the number of blue crayons is 14 + 5 = 19.
3) There are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons. So, the number of yellow crayons is (2 * 19) - 6 = 38 - 6 = 32.

Answer: 32
