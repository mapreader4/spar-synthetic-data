Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kelsey had 2/5 of a tray of eggs
* Stephanie had 1/2 of a tray of eggs
* Alayah brought 40 more eggs than Kelsey and Stephanie combined
* Willa had 2 trays of eggs already

First, let's calculate how many eggs Kelsey and Stephanie brought:
* Kelsey had 2/5 of a tray, which is 2/5 * 30 = 12 eggs
* Stephanie had 1/2 of a tray, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 eggs
* Together, Kelsey and Stephanie brought 12 + 15 = 27 eggs

Next, let's calculate how many eggs Alayah brought:
* Alayah brought 40 more eggs than Kelsey and Stephanie combined
* Kelsey and Stephanie brought 27 eggs, so Alayah brought 27 + 40 = 67 eggs

Finally, let's add up the total number of eggs:
* Willa had 2 trays, which is 2 * 30 = 60 eggs
* Kelsey brought 12 eggs
* Stephanie brought 15 eggs
* Alayah brought 67 eggs
* Total eggs = 60 + 12 + 15 + 67 = 154 eggs
