Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The entrepreneur has three different dollar amount levels of financial backing options.
2) Each level is ten times as high as the previous one.
3) He needs to raise $12,000 to get his business off the ground.
4) He succeeded after getting two backers at the highest level, three at the second level, and ten at the lowest level.
5) Let's call the lowest level of financial backing "x".
6) Then the second level is 10x, and the highest level is 100x.
7) The total amount raised is:
   - 2 backers at 100x = 200x
   - 3 backers at 10x = 30x
   - 10 backers at x = 10x
   - Total = 200x + 30x + 10x = 240x
8) We know the total amount raised is $12,000, so we can set up an equation:
   - 240x = 12,000
   - x = 50
9) Therefore, the highest level of financial backing is 100x = 100 * 50 = $5,000.

Answer: $5,000
