Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Olly has 3 dogs, 2 cats, and 1 ferret, for a total of 6 pets.
2) Each pet needs 4 shoes, one for each paw.
3) To calculate the total number of shoes Olly needs, we multiply the total number of pets (6) by the number of shoes per pet (4).
4) 6 pets x 4 shoes per pet = 24 shoes.
