Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ben bought the lawnmower for $100.
2) After 6 months, the value of the mower dropped by 25%. To calculate the new value:
   * Original value: $100
   * 25% drop means the value is now 75% of the original value
   * 75% of $100 = $75
3) Over the next year, the value of the mower dropped another 20%. To calculate the new value:
   * Original value: $75
   * 20% drop means the value is now 80% of the original value
   * 80% of $75 = $60
Therefore, after the 6 months and 1 year, the lawnmower is worth $60.

Answer: 60
