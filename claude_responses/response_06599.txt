Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Johnson gives Gina 69 potatoes.
2) Johnson gives Tom twice as much potatoes as he gave Gina. So, Tom receives 2 x 69 = 138 potatoes.
3) Johnson gives Anne one-third of the amount of potatoes he gave Tom. So, Anne receives 1/3 x 138 = 46 potatoes.
4) Now, we need to find the total number of potatoes Johnson has given away:
   - Gina: 69 potatoes
   - Tom: 138 potatoes
   - Anne: 46 potatoes
   - Total given away: 69 + 138 + 46 = 253 potatoes
5) The sack originally contained 300 potatoes.
6) So, the number of potatoes Johnson has left is:
   - Potatoes in sack - Potatoes given away = 300 - 253 = 47 potatoes.

Answer: 47 potatoes.
