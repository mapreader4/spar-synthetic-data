Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The CDs were priced as follows:
  - The Life Journey: $100 per CD
  - A Day a Life: $50 per CD
  - When You Rescind: $85 per CD
* You bought 3 of each CD
* To calculate the total amount spent, we need to multiply the price of each CD by the number of CDs purchased, and then add them all together.

For The Life Journey:
* 3 CDs x $100 per CD = $300

For A Day a Life:
* 3 CDs x $50 per CD = $150

For When You Rescind:
* 3 CDs x $85 per CD = $255

Now, we add up the total:
* $300 + $150 + $255 = $705

Answer: 705
