Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cynthia harvested 67 potatoes from her garden
* She cut 13 of them into wedges
* That means she had 67 - 13 = 54 potatoes remaining
* She halved the remaining 54 potatoes
* So she had 27 potatoes to make french fries with, and 27 potatoes to make potato chips with
* Each potato can be cut into 8 wedges
* So the 13 potatoes she cut into wedges made 13 * 8 = 104 wedges
* Each potato can make 20 potato chips
* So the 27 potatoes she used to make potato chips made 27 * 20 = 540 potato chips
* To find the difference between the number of potato chips and wedges, we subtract:
* 540 potato chips - 104 wedges = 436 more potato chips than wedges

Answer: 436
