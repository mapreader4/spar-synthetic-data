Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Lisa's Spending:
1. Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts.
2. Lisa then spends half of the $40 on jeans, which is $20.
3. Lisa then spends twice the $40 on coats, which is $80.

Carly's Spending:
1. Carly spends a quarter of the $40 that Lisa spent on t-shirts, which is $10.
2. Carly spends 3 times as much as Lisa on jeans, which is 3 x $20 = $60.
3. Carly spends a quarter of the $80 that Lisa spent on coats, which is $20.

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by Lisa and Carly:
Lisa's total spending: $40 + $20 + $80 = $140
Carly's total spending: $10 + $60 + $20 = $90

Total spending by Lisa and Carly: $140 + $90 = $230

Answer: $230
