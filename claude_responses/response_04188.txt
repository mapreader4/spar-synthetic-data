Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The original price of the shirt is $80.
* The attendant is giving Barry a 15% special discount.
* To calculate the discount amount, we take 15% of the original price:
    * 15% of $80 = 0.15 x $80 = $12
* To calculate the final price after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:
    * $80 - $12 = $68
Therefore, the amount Barry is supposed to pay for the shirt, considering the 15% special discount, is:
Answer: $68
