Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know there are 20 red marbles in the box.
2. The number of green marbles is three times the number of red marbles. So, the number of green marbles is 3 x 20 = 60.
3. The number of yellow marbles is 20% of the number of green marbles. So, the number of yellow marbles is 0.2 x 60 = 12.
4. We are told that the total number of marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 3 x 60 = 180.
5. To find the number of marbles of a different color, we need to subtract the red, green, and yellow marbles from the total number of marbles.
6. The total number of marbles is 180.
7. The number of red marbles is 20.
8. The number of green marbles is 60.
9. The number of yellow marbles is 12.
10. The number of marbles of a different color is 180 - 20 - 60 - 12 = 88.

Answer: 88
