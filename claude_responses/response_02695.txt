Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath.
2. He then spends half as long blow-drying her, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
3. So the total time spent bathing and blow-drying the dog is 20 + 10 = 30 minutes.
4. Marcus then takes his dog for a walk along a 3-mile trail.
5. He walks at a speed of 6 miles per hour, which is 6 miles in 60 minutes.
6. So to walk 3 miles, it will take him 3/6 * 60 = 30 minutes.
7. The total time spent with his dog is the time spent bathing/blow-drying (30 minutes) plus the time spent walking (30 minutes).

Answer: 60 minutes
