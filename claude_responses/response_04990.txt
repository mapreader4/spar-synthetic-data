Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leo dropped off 10 pairs of trousers and some shirts at Sudsy Laundry
* He was charged $9 for each pair of trousers and $5 per shirt
* The total bill was $140
* When Leo went to pick up his clothes, the attendant said he had only dropped off 2 shirts

To find the number of shirts that were missing, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the trousers
2. Subtract the cost of the trousers from the total bill to get the cost of the shirts
3. Divide the cost of the shirts by the price per shirt to get the number of shirts
4. Subtract the number of shirts the attendant found (2) from the total number of shirts to get the number of missing shirts

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the trousers
* 10 pairs of trousers at $9 each = 10 * $9 = $90

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the trousers from the total bill to get the cost of the shirts
* Total bill = $140
* Cost of trousers = $90
* Cost of shirts = $140 - $90 = $50

Step 3: Divide the cost of the shirts by the price per shirt to get the number of shirts
* Price per shirt = $5
* Number of shirts = $50 / $5 = 10 shirts

Step 4: Subtract the number of shirts the attendant found (2) from the total number of shirts to get the number of missing shirts
* Total shirts = 10
* Shirts found = 2
* Missing shirts = 10 - 2 = 8
