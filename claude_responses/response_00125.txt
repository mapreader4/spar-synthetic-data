Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Haley is currently 20 inches tall.
2) She grows at a rate of 3 inches per year.
3) We want to find her height after 10 years.
4) To calculate her height after 10 years, we need to add the growth over those 10 years to her current height.
5) Since she grows 3 inches per year, in 10 years she will grow 3 * 10 = 30 inches.
6) Adding her current height of 20 inches to the 30 inches of growth, we get:
20 inches + 30 inches = 50 inches.

Answer: 50 inches
