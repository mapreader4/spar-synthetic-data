Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Micah has 7 fish in his aquarium.
2) Kenneth has three times as many fish as Micah, so Kenneth has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
3) Matthias has 15 less fish than Kenneth, so Matthias has 21 - 15 = 6 fish.
4) To find the total number of fish the boys have, we add up the number of fish each boy has:
   Micah: 7 fish
   Kenneth: 21 fish
   Matthias: 6 fish
   Total: 7 + 21 + 6 = 34 fish

Answer: 34
