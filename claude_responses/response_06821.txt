Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Benjamin walks to work and home five days a week.
   - That's 6 miles to work + 6 miles back home = 12 miles per day
   - 12 miles per day x 5 days = 60 miles per week

2) Benjamin walks his dog twice a day every day.
   - Each dog walk is 2 miles
   - 2 miles per walk x 2 walks per day = 4 miles per day
   - 4 miles per day x 7 days = 28 miles per week

3) Benjamin walks to his best friend's house once a week.
   - The distance to his best friend's house is 1 mile
   - 1 mile there + 1 mile back = 2 miles per week

4) Benjamin walks to the convenience store twice a week.
   - The distance to the convenience store is 3 miles
   - 3 miles there + 3 miles back = 6 miles per week

Now, we add up all the miles:
60 miles + 28 miles + 2 miles + 6 miles = 96 miles

Answer: 96 miles
