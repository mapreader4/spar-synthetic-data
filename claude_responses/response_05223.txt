Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Spongebob sells 30 burgers for $2 each.
   * Total revenue from burgers = 30 burgers x $2 per burger = $60

2. Spongebob sells 12 large fries for $1.5 each.
   * Total revenue from fries = 12 fries x $1.5 per fry = $18

3. To calculate the total amount Spongebob will earn for the day, we add the revenue from burgers and fries:
   * Total revenue = $60 (burgers) + $18 (fries) = $78

Answer: $78
