Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mary will buy:
   - A platter of pasta for $20
   - A loaf of bread for $2
   - Total spent by Mary = $20 + $2 = $22

2. Elle and Andrea will split the cost for:
   - 4 cans of soda at $1.50 each, so 4 x $1.50 = $6
   - Chicken wings for $10
   - Total spent by Elle and Andrea = $6 + $10 = $16

3. Joe will buy:
   - A cake that costs $5

4. Total spent by the rest of the firm (Elle, Andrea, and Joe) = $16 + $5 = $21

5. The difference between what Mary spent and what the rest of the firm spent is:
   - Mary's spending: $22
   - Rest of the firm's spending: $21
   - Difference = $22 - $21 = $1
