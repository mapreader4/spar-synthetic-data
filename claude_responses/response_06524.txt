Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lynne bought 7 books about cats
* Each book cost $7
* So the total cost of the cat books is 7 x $7 = $49
* Lynne also bought 2 books about the solar system
* Each book cost $7
* So the total cost of the solar system books is 2 x $7 = $14
* Lynne also bought 3 magazines
* Each magazine cost $4
* So the total cost of the magazines is 3 x $4 = $12
* To find the total amount Lynne spent, we add up the costs of the cat books, solar system books, and magazines:
* $49 + $14 + $12 = $75

Answer: $75
