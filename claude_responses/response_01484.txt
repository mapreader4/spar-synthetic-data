Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lucy lost one-third of her money. This means she had two-thirds of her original amount left.
2) She then spent one-fourth of the remainder. This means she spent one-fourth of the two-thirds she had left.
3) After spending one-fourth of the two-thirds, she was left with three-fourths of the two-thirds, which is 3/4 * 2/3 = 1/2 of her original amount.
4) We know that the amount she had left was $15. So, 1/2 of her original amount was $15.
5) To find her original amount, we need to multiply $15 by 2.
