Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hillary's teacher assigned 1 hour of reading during the weekend
* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* On Friday night, Hillary read for 16 minutes
* On Saturday, Hillary read for 28 minutes
* To calculate the total time Hillary has read so far:
    - Friday: 16 minutes
    - Saturday: 28 minutes
    - Total time read so far: 16 + 28 = 44 minutes
* To calculate the remaining time Hillary needs to read:
    - Total time assigned: 60 minutes
    - Time read so far: 44 minutes
    - Remaining time to read: 60 - 44 = 16 minutes

Answer: 16 minutes
