Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that Betty has 3 red beads for every 2 blue beads.
2) We also know that Betty has 30 red beads.
3) Let's set up a proportion to solve for the number of blue beads:
3 red beads / 2 blue beads = 30 red beads / x blue beads
4) Cross-multiplying, we get:
3x = 60
5) Solving for x, we get:
x = 60 / 3 = 20
Answer: 20 blue beads.
