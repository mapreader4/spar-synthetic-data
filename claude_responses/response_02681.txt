Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jonathan eats 2500 calories every day except for Saturday
* On Saturday, he consumes an extra 1000 calories
* He burns 3000 calories every day

To calculate his weekly caloric deficit, we need to find the total number of calories he consumes in a week and subtract the total number of calories he burns in a week.

Calories consumed in a week:
* Monday-Friday (5 days): 2500 calories per day x 5 days = 12,500 calories
* Saturday: 2500 + 1000 = 3,500 calories
* Sunday: 2500 calories
* Total calories consumed in a week: 12,500 + 3,500 + 2,500 = 18,500 calories

Calories burned in a week:
* 7 days x 3000 calories per day = 21,000 calories

Caloric deficit:
* Calories consumed - Calories burned = 18,500 - 21,000 = -2,500 calories

Answer: -2,500
