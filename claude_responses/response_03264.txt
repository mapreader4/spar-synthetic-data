Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Sammy has 8 gifts to wrap.
2) Each gift requires 1.5 meters of ribbon.
3) To find the total amount of ribbon needed, we multiply the number of gifts (8) by the amount of ribbon per gift (1.5 meters):
8 gifts x 1.5 meters per gift = 12 meters of ribbon needed.
4) Tom let Sammy use his 15-meter long ribbon.
5) To find the amount of ribbon left, we subtract the amount of ribbon needed (12 meters) from the amount of ribbon available (15 meters):
15 meters - 12 meters = 3 meters of ribbon left.

Answer: 3 meters
