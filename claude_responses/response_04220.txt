Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each carton contains 5 packs of gum
* Each pack contains 3 sticks of gum
* So, each carton contains 5 packs x 3 sticks per pack = 15 sticks of gum
* Each brown box contains 4 cartons of gum
* So, each brown box contains 4 cartons x 15 sticks per carton = 60 sticks of gum
* We are asked how many sticks of gum are in 8 brown boxes
* So, we need to multiply the number of sticks per brown box (60) by the number of brown boxes (8)
* 60 sticks per box x 8 boxes = 480 sticks of gum

Answer: 480
