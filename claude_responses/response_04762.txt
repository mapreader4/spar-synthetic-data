Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the screen area of Bill's TV:
   * Screen area = length x width
   * Screen area = 48 inches x 100 inches = 4,800 square inches

2. Calculate the screen area of Bob's TV:
   * Screen area = length x width
   * Screen area = 70 inches x 60 inches = 4,200 square inches

3. Calculate the weight of each TV in ounces:
   * Weight = screen area x 4 ounces per square inch
   * Bill's TV weight = 4,800 square inches x 4 ounces/square inch = 19,200 ounces
   * Bob's TV weight = 4,200 square inches x 4 ounces/square inch = 16,800 ounces

4. Calculate the difference in weight between the two TVs in ounces:
   * Difference in weight = Bob's TV weight - Bill's TV weight
   * Difference in weight = 16,800 ounces - 19,200 ounces = -2,400 ounces

5. Convert the difference in weight from ounces to pounds:
   * 1 pound = 16 ounces
   * Difference in weight in pounds = -2,400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = -150 pounds

Answer: -150 pounds
