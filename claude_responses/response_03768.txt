Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 10 crates in the shipping container
* Each crate is filled with 6 boxes
* Each box is filled with 4 washing machines
* So, the total number of washing machines in the shipping container is:
  * 10 crates x 6 boxes per crate x 4 washing machines per box = 240 washing machines
* A worker removes 1 washing machine from each box
* Since there are 6 boxes per crate, and 10 crates, there are a total of 60 boxes
* Therefore, the total number of washing machines removed is:
  * 60 boxes x 1 washing machine per box = 60 washing machines

Answer: 60
