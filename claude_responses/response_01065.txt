Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. John's raw squat without sleeves or wraps is 600 pounds.
2. Sleeves add 30 pounds to his lift, so his squat with sleeves is 600 + 30 = 630 pounds.
3. Wraps add 25% to his squat. To calculate this, we take his raw squat of 600 pounds and multiply it by 1.25 (since 25% is the same as 1.25). This gives us 600 x 1.25 = 750 pounds.
4. To find the difference between the pounds gained from wraps versus sleeves, we subtract the pounds gained from sleeves (630 pounds) from the pounds gained from wraps (750 pounds).
750 pounds - 630 pounds = 120 pounds.

Answer: 120 pounds.
