Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. This means that the remaining one-third of the class have non-brown eyes.
2) Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. This means that the other half of the students with brown eyes have non-black hair.
3) We are told that there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair.
4) Since half of the students with brown eyes have black hair, the total number of students with brown eyes is 6 * 2 = 12.
5) Since two-thirds of the class have brown eyes, the total number of students in the class is 12 / (2/3) = 18.

Answer: 18
