Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nalani had two female dogs that gave birth to 10 puppies each, so the total number of puppies was 10 + 10 = 20 puppies.
2) Nalani then sold 3/4 of the puppies, which is 3/4 * 20 = 15 puppies.
3) Each puppy was sold for $200, so the total amount of money Nalani received is 15 puppies * $200 per puppy = $3,000.

Answer: $3,000
