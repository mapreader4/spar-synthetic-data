Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 30 ducks for $10 each, so the total cost of the ducks is:
   30 ducks x $10 per duck = $300
2) Each duck weighs 4 pounds, so the total weight of the 30 ducks is:
   30 ducks x 4 pounds per duck = 120 pounds
3) John sells the ducks for $5 per pound, so the total revenue from selling the ducks is:
   120 pounds x $5 per pound = $600
4) To calculate the profit, we take the total revenue and subtract the total cost:
   $600 (revenue) - $300 (cost) = $300 profit

Answer: $300
