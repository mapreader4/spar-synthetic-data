Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Margaux's friend pays her $5 per day.
2) Margaux's brother pays her $8 per day.
3) Margaux's cousin pays her $4 per day.
4) We want to know how much money Margaux will collect after 7 days.
5) For her friend, she will collect $5 per day for 7 days, which is $5 x 7 = $35.
6) For her brother, she will collect $8 per day for 7 days, which is $8 x 7 = $56.
7) For her cousin, she will collect $4 per day for 7 days, which is $4 x 7 = $28.
8) Adding up the amounts from her friend, brother, and cousin, the total amount Margaux will collect after 7 days is $35 + $56 + $28 = $119.

Answer: 119
