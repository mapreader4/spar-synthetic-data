Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Taegan won tickets from 5 carnival games
* She also found 5 tickets on the floor
* Each ticket is worth $3
* The total value of the tickets is $30

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Taegan has:
* Total value of tickets = $30
* Value of each ticket = $3
* Total number of tickets = $30 / $3 = 10 tickets

Now, we know that Taegan won an equal number of tickets from each of the 5 games, and she also found 5 tickets on the floor.
* Total tickets = 10
* Tickets found on the floor = 5
* Tickets won from each game = (10 - 5) / 5 = 1

Therefore, Taegan won 1 ticket from each of the 5 carnival games.
