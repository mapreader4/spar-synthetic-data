Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Samuel drives 50 miles/hour for 3 hours.
   * Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 50 miles/hour * 3 hours = 150 miles
2) Then, he drives 80 miles/hour for 4 hours.
   * Distance traveled in the next 4 hours = 80 miles/hour * 4 hours = 320 miles
3) The total distance traveled so far is:
   * 150 miles + 320 miles = 470 miles
4) The total distance he needs to travel to the hotel is 600 miles.
5) Therefore, the distance he is from the hotel is:
   * 600 miles - 470 miles = 130 miles

Answer: 130 miles
