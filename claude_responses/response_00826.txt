Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James takes 20 units per semester at community college.
2) Each unit costs $50.
3) We need to find the cost for 2 semesters.
4) For 1 semester, the cost would be:
   * 20 units per semester x $50 per unit = $1,000 per semester
5) For 2 semesters, the total cost would be:
   * $1,000 per semester x 2 semesters = $2,000

Answer: $2,000
