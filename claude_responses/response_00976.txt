Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ludwig works 7 days a week
* On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he works half of the day
* His daily salary is $10

To calculate his weekly earnings, we need to:
1. Calculate his earnings for the 4 days he works a full day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)
   * 4 days x $10 per day = $40
2. Calculate his earnings for the 3 days he works half a day (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)
   * 3 days x $5 per day (half day) = $15
3. Add the two amounts together to get his total weekly earnings
   * $40 + $15 = $55

Answer: $55
