Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Julio makes a mocktail every evening
* Each mocktail requires 1 tablespoon of lime juice
* He can usually squeeze 2 tablespoons of lime juice per lime
* So, each lime can make 2 mocktails
* After 30 days, he will have made 30 mocktails
* Each mocktail requires 1 tablespoon of lime juice
* So, in total, he will have used 30 tablespoons of lime juice
* Since each lime can make 2 tablespoons of lime juice, he will need 15 limes
* Limes are 3 for $1.00
* So, he will need to buy 5 sets of 3 limes, which is 15 limes
* 5 sets of 3 limes at $1.00 per set is $5.00

Answer: $5.00
