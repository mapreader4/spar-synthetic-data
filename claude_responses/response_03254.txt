Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Deborah has 4 letters to mail
* Standard postage is $1.08 per letter
* Deborah is mailing 2 letters internationally
* The total cost to mail 4 letters is $4.60

First, let's calculate the cost of the 2 domestic letters:
* 2 letters x $1.08 per letter = $2.16

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 2 international letters:
* Total cost = $4.60
* Cost of 2 domestic letters = $2.16
* Cost of 2 international letters = $4.60 - $2.16 = $2.44

The cost of the 2 international letters is $2.44, so the additional charge per international letter is:
* $2.44 / 2 letters = $1.22 per international letter

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
* $1.22 x 100 = 122 cents

Answer: 122 cents
