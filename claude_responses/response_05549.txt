Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jasmine bought 4 pounds of coffee beans
* Each pound of coffee beans costs $2.50
* So, the total cost of the coffee beans is:
4 pounds x $2.50 per pound = $10.00
* Jasmine also bought 2 gallons of milk
* Each gallon of milk costs $3.50
* So, the total cost of the milk is:
2 gallons x $3.50 per gallon = $7.00
* To calculate the total amount Jasmine will pay, we add the cost of the coffee beans and the cost of the milk:
$10.00 + $7.00 = $17.00

Answer: $17
