Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The queen starts with 12,500 bees.
2) Every day, 3,000 new bees hatch from the queen's eggs.
3) Every day, the queen loses 900 bees.
4) So, the net increase in bees per day is 3,000 - 900 = 2,100.
5) Over 7 days, the total increase in bees is 7 * 2,100 = 14,700.
6) Adding the initial 12,500 bees, the total number of bees in the hive at the end of 7 days is 12,500 + 14,700 = 27,200.

Answer: 27,200
