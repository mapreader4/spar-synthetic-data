Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lena played video games for 3.5 hours last weekend.
2) 3.5 hours is equal to 3 hours and 30 minutes.
3) Her brother played 17 minutes more than she did.
4) 17 minutes is 0.283 hours.
5) So her brother played for 3.5 hours + 0.283 hours = 3.783 hours.
6) 3.783 hours is equal to 3 hours and 47 minutes.
7) Now we need to add the time that Lena and her brother played video games together.
8) Lena played for 3 hours and 30 minutes.
9) Her brother played for 3 hours and 47 minutes.
10) Together, they played for 3 hours and 30 minutes + 3 hours and 47 minutes = 7 hours and 17 minutes.
Answer: 437 minutes.
