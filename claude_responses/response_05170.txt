Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We have 3/5th of 20 liters of water.
   * 3/5 of 20 liters = (3/5) * 20 = 12 liters of water.

2) We have 5/6th of 18 liters of vinegar.
   * 5/6 of 18 liters = (5/6) * 18 = 15 liters of vinegar.

3) To find the total amount of the mixture, we add the water and vinegar:
   * 12 liters of water + 15 liters of vinegar = 27 liters of mixture.

Answer: 27 liters.
