Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Peter has 20 books in total.
2) Peter has read 40% of the 20 books.
   * 40% of 20 books = 0.4 * 20 = 8 books
3) Peter's brother has read 10% of the 20 books.
   * 10% of 20 books = 0.1 * 20 = 2 books
4) To find the difference between the number of books Peter has read and the number his brother has read, we subtract:
   * 8 books (Peter) - 2 books (brother) = 6 books
