Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Maddox and Theo both bought 3 Polaroid Cameras each, at $20 per camera.
2. Maddox's total cost for the 3 cameras: 3 x $20 = $60
3. Theo's total cost for the 3 cameras: 3 x $20 = $60
4. Maddox sold his 3 cameras at $28 each.
   - Maddox's total revenue: 3 x $28 = $84
   - Maddox's total profit: $84 - $60 = $24
5. Theo sold his 3 cameras at $23 each.
   - Theo's total revenue: 3 x $23 = $69
   - Theo's total profit: $69 - $60 = $9
6. The difference in profit between Maddox and Theo is:
   - Maddox's profit - Theo's profit = $24 - $9 = $15

Answer: $15
