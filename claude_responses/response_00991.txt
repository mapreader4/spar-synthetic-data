Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 unicorns in the Enchanted Forest
* For every step a unicorn takes, 4 flowers bloom
* The unicorns are going to walk 9 kilometers across the forest, side-by-side
* Each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step

First, we need to calculate the total number of steps the unicorns will take:
* The unicorns are walking 9 kilometers, which is 9,000 meters
* Each unicorn moves 3 meters per step
* Therefore, the total number of steps for each unicorn is 9,000 / 3 = 3,000 steps
* Since there are 6 unicorns, the total number of steps is 6 * 3,000 = 18,000 steps

Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers that will bloom:
* For each step a unicorn takes, 4 flowers bloom
* The unicorns take a total of 18,000 steps
* Therefore, the total number of flowers that will bloom is 18,000 * 4 = 72,000 flowers

Answer: 72,000
