Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The park started with 30,000 elephants on Friday night.
2) Over the next 4 hours, there was a constant exodus of 2,880 elephants per hour.
   * Total elephants leaving the park during the 4-hour exodus = 2,880 elephants/hour * 4 hours = 11,520 elephants
3) After the 4-hour exodus, the number of elephants in the park was 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 elephants.
4) Over the next 7 hours, new elephants entered the park at a constant rate.
5) The final number of elephants in the park was 28,980.
6) To find the rate at which the new elephants entered the park, we need to calculate the total number of elephants that entered the park during the 7-hour period, and then divide that by 7 hours.
   * Total elephants that entered the park = Final number of elephants (28,980) - Remaining elephants after exodus (18,480) = 10,500 elephants
   * Rate of new elephants entering the park = 10,500 elephants / 7 hours = 1,500 elephants/hour

Answer: 1,500 elephants/hour
