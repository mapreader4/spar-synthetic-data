Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kobe ordered 5 pieces of fried chicken
* Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe
* Twice as much as 5 is 10
* So Pau ordered 10 pieces of fried chicken
* They then order another set of fried chicken
* For the first order, Kobe had 5 pieces and Pau had 10 pieces
* For the second order, Kobe will have another 5 pieces and Pau will have another 10 pieces
* In total, Pau will have eaten:
    - First order: 10 pieces
    - Second order: 10 pieces
    - Total: 10 + 10 = 20 pieces

Answer: 20
