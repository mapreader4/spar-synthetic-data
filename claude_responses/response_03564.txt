Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Tina bought a loaf of bread for $50, 2oz of ham for $150, and a cake for $200.
2) To calculate the total cost, we add up the prices of the items:
$50 + $150 + $200 = $400
3) To calculate the percent of the cost that is the ham and bread, we need to find the total cost of the ham and bread, and then divide it by the total cost.
4) The total cost of the ham and bread is $50 + $150 = $200.
5) To find the percent, we divide the cost of the ham and bread ($200) by the total cost ($400) and multiply by 100:
(200 / 400) * 100 = 50%
Answer: 50
