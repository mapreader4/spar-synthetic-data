Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The baker's usual daily sales:
   - 20 pastries at $2 each = $40
   - 10 loaves of bread at $4 each = $40
   - Total usual daily sales = $40 + $40 = $80

2. The baker's sales for today:
   - 14 pastries at $2 each = $28
   - 25 loaves of bread at $4 each = $100
   - Total sales for today = $28 + $100 = $128

3. The difference between the daily average and today's total:
   - Daily average = $80
   - Today's total = $128
   - Difference = $128 - $80 = $48

Answer: $48
