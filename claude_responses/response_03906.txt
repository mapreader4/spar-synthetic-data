Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Verna weighs 17 pounds more than Haley.
2) Haley weighs 103 pounds.
3) Therefore, Verna weighs 103 + 17 = 120 pounds.
4) Verna weighs half as much as Sherry.
5) So if Verna weighs 120 pounds, then Sherry must weigh 2 * 120 = 240 pounds.
6) The total weight of Verna and Sherry is 120 + 240 = 360 pounds.

Answer: 360
