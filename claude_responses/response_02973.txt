Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jean has 60 stuffies.
2) She keeps 1/3 of them. To find 1/3 of 60, we divide 60 by 3: 60 / 3 = 20. So Jean keeps 20 stuffies.
3) She gives away the rest, which is 60 - 20 = 40 stuffies.
4) She gives 1/4 of the 40 stuffies she gave away to her sister Janet. To find 1/4 of 40, we divide 40 by 4: 40 / 4 = 10. 
5) Therefore, Janet got 10 stuffies.

Answer: 10
