Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Heather needs to sew a total of 150 aprons for the kiddie crew program.
2) She has already sewed 13 aprons.
3) Today, she sewed three times as many aprons as she did initially, which is 3 x 13 = 39 aprons.
4) So the total number of aprons she has sewed so far is 13 + 39 = 52 aprons.
5) The remaining number of aprons needed is 150 - 52 = 98 aprons.
6) Heather wants to sew half of the remaining 98 aprons, which is 98 / 2 = 49 aprons.

Answer: 49
