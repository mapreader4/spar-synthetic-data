Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined.
2) Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara.
3) Let's represent the number of apples Sara ate as x.
4) Since Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara, the number of apples Ali ate is 4x.
5) The total number of apples eaten is the sum of the apples eaten by Ali and Sara, which is 4x + x = 5x.
6) We know the total number of apples eaten is 80, so we can set up the equation: 5x = 80.
7) Solving for x, we get x = 16.
Answer: 16
