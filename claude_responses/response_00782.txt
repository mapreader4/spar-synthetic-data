Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Melissa has 56 square meters of fabric to make the dresses.
2) Each dress takes 4 square meters of fabric.
3) To find the number of dresses Melissa can make, we divide the total fabric (56 square meters) by the fabric required per dress (4 square meters):
56 square meters / 4 square meters per dress = 14 dresses
4) Each dress takes 3 hours to make.
5) To find the total number of hours Melissa has to work, we multiply the number of dresses (14) by the time per dress (3 hours):
14 dresses x 3 hours per dress = 42 hours

Answer: 42 hours
