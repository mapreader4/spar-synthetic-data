Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On Friday:
* Hank started with an unknown number of bicycles in stock
* He sold 10 bicycles
* He bought 15 more bicycles

So, the net change in the number of bicycles in stock on Friday is:
* 15 (bought) - 10 (sold) = 5 more bicycles

On Saturday:
* Hank had the number of bicycles from Friday, plus the 5 more he added
* He sold 12 bicycles
* He bought 8 more bicycles

So, the net change in the number of bicycles in stock on Saturday is:
* 8 (bought) - 12 (sold) = 4 fewer bicycles

On Sunday:
* Hank had the number of bicycles from Saturday, minus the 4 he lost
* He sold 9 bicycles
* He bought 11 more bicycles

So, the net change in the number of bicycles in stock on Sunday is:
* 11 (bought) - 9 (sold) = 2 more bicycles

To calculate the net increase over the three days:
* Friday: +5 bicycles
* Saturday: -4 bicycles
* Sunday: +2 bicycles
* Total net increase: 5 - 4 + 2 = 3 bicycles
