Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Camille's daughter orders a single cone, which has 1 scoop of ice cream.
* Camille orders a banana split, which has 3 times as many scoops as the single cone. So the banana split has 3 scoops of ice cream.
* Camille's husband orders a waffle bowl, which has 1 more scoop than the banana split. So the waffle bowl has 4 scoops of ice cream.
* In total, the ice cream man served:
  - 1 scoop for the single cone
  - 3 scoops for the banana split
  - 4 scoops for the waffle bowl
* Adding these up, the total number of scoops of ice cream served is:
  1 + 3 + 4 = 8
