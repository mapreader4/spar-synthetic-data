Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Last year's production was 5000 phones.
2) This year's production is twice as many as last year, so this year's production is 2 * 5000 = 10,000 phones.
3) A quarter of this year's production is sold, which means 1/4 of 10,000 phones are sold. That is 10,000 / 4 = 2,500 phones sold.
4) The number of phones left in the factory is the total production this year (10,000 phones) minus the number of phones sold (2,500 phones).
Answer: 7,500 phones
