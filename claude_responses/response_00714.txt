Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John's website gets 30,000 visits per month
* Each visit earns him $0.01
* We want to find out how much he makes per day

First, let's calculate his monthly earnings:
* 30,000 visits per month x $0.01 per visit = $300 per month

Now, to find his daily earnings, we need to divide his monthly earnings by the number of days in a month:
* $300 per month / 30 days per month = $10 per day

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 10
