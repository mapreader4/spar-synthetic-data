Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Omar buys a 12-ounce cup of coffee
* On the way to work, he drinks one-quarter of the cup
* One-quarter of 12 ounces is 3 ounces
* So, he drinks 3 ounces on the way to work
* That leaves 12 - 3 = 9 ounces remaining in the cup
* When he gets to his office, he drinks another half of the cup
* Half of 9 ounces is 4.5 ounces
* So, he drinks 4.5 ounces at his office
* That leaves 9 - 4.5 = 4.5 ounces remaining in the cup
* He forgets to drink any more of his coffee once he starts working
* When he remembers his coffee, he only drinks 1 ounce because it is cold
* That leaves 4.5 - 1 = 3.5 ounces remaining in the cup

Answer: 3.5 ounces
