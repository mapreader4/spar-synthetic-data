Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total amount of all the items Pauline wants to buy is $150 before sales tax.
2) The sales tax is 8% of the total amount purchased.
3) To calculate the sales tax, we take 8% of $150:
   * 8% of $150 = 0.08 * $150 = $12
4) To calculate the total amount Pauline will spend, we add the sales tax to the original total:
   * $150 + $12 = $162

Answer: 162
