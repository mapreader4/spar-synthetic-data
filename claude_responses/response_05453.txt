Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes Bryan 5 minutes to walk from his house to the bus station
* Then he rides the bus for 20 minutes
* After that, he walks 5 minutes from the bus station to his job
* So the total time for his commute to work is 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes
* He does the same thing in reverse to get home from work, so the total time for his commute to and from work is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes per day
* There are 365 days in a year, so if he works every day, he would spend:
* 60 minutes per day x 365 days per year = 21,900 minutes per year
* 21,900 minutes per year / 60 minutes per hour = 365 hours per year

Answer: 365 hours
