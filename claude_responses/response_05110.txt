Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Mark has 12 candy bars in total.
2) He has 3 Snickers and 2 Mars bars.
3) To find the number of Butterfingers, we need to subtract the number of Snickers and Mars bars from the total number of candy bars.
4) The number of Snickers and Mars bars is 3 + 2 = 5.
5) 12 total candy bars - 5 Snickers and Mars bars = 7 Butterfingers.
