Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The bus has 13 rows of seats.
2) Each row is split into two sections by the aisle running down the middle of the bus.
3) The school only allows two students to sit in each section.
4) To calculate the total number of students that can be seated on the bus, we need to multiply the number of sections by the number of students allowed per section.
5) The number of sections is equal to the number of rows multiplied by 2 (since each row has two sections).
6) 13 rows x 2 sections per row = 26 sections.
7) Since the school allows 2 students per section, the total number of students that can be seated on the bus is:
26 sections x 2 students per section = 52 students.

Answer: 52
