Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have a total of 200 bananas.
2) Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia.
3) Lydia has 60 bananas.
4) Since Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia, and Lydia has 60 bananas, then Dawn has 60 + 40 = 100 bananas.
5) The total number of bananas is 200, and Dawn has 100 and Lydia has 60, so the remaining bananas must be Donna's.
6) Donna has 200 - 100 - 60 = 40 bananas.

Answer: 40
