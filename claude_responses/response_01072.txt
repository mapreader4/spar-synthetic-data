Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* GooGoo manufactures two types of shirts: one with 3 buttons and the other with 5 buttons
* The department store ordered 200 of each type of shirt
* To calculate the total number of buttons needed:
  - For the 200 shirts with 3 buttons each, the total number of buttons needed is 200 * 3 = 600 buttons
  - For the 200 shirts with 5 buttons each, the total number of buttons needed is 200 * 5 = 1,000 buttons
* To find the total number of buttons needed for the entire order, we add the buttons for both types of shirts:
  - Total buttons needed = 600 + 1,000 = 1,600 buttons

Answer: 1,600
