Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The original log is 20 feet long.
2) John cuts the log in half, so each cut piece is 10 feet long (20 feet / 2 = 10 feet).
3) The weight of the log is given as 150 pounds per linear foot.
4) To find the weight of each cut piece, we need to multiply the length of the cut piece (10 feet) by the weight per linear foot (150 pounds).
5) 10 feet x 150 pounds/foot = 1,500 pounds.

Answer: 1,500 pounds.
