Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mike does 2 pull-ups every time he goes into his office
* He goes into his office 5 times a day
* So in one day, he does 2 pull-ups x 5 times = 10 pull-ups
* There are 7 days in a week
* So in one week, he does 10 pull-ups per day x 7 days = 70 pull-ups

Answer: 70
