Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jenna gets 2 tickets from the concert website for $50 each.
   * Cost of the 2 tickets from the website: 2 x $50 = $100

2. The scalper offers to sell 2 more tickets for 240% of the normal price, but Jenna convinces him to give her $10 off the total.
   * Normal price of each ticket: $50
   * Scalper's price: 240% of $50 = 2.4 x $50 = $120 per ticket
   * Total cost for 2 tickets from the scalper: 2 x $120 = $240
   * Discount from the scalper: $10
   * Net cost for 2 tickets from the scalper: $240 - $10 = $230

3. One of Jenna's friends gets a discounted ticket through her job for 60% of the normal price.
   * Normal price of each ticket: $50
   * Discounted price: 60% of $50 = 0.6 x $50 = $30

4. Total cost for all 5 tickets:
   * 2 tickets from the website: $100
   * 2 tickets from the scalper: $230
   * 1 discounted ticket: $30
   * Total cost: $100 + $230 + $30 = $360

Answer: $360
