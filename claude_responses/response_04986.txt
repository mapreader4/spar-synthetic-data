Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Laura needs to buy:
  - 2 cups of flour at $4 per cup = $8
  - 2 cups of sugar at $2 per cup = $4
  - 1 cup of butter at $2.5 per cup = $2.5
  - 2 eggs at $0.5 per egg = $1
* The total cost of the ingredients is $8 + $4 + $2.5 + $1 = $15.5
* The cake is cut into 6 slices, and Laura's mother eats 2 slices over the first two days.
* This means that the dog ate the remaining 4 slices.
* Since the total cost of the ingredients is $15.5, and the dog ate 4 out of the 6 slices, the cost of the amount the dog ate is:
* (4/6) * $15.5 = $10.33

Answer: $10.33
