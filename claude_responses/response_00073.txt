Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roger's baseball team has 13 members
* There are also 3 coaches and 2 helpers
* In total, there are 13 + 3 + 2 = 18 people who need a snack
* The trail mix comes in packs of 6 individual pouches
* To determine how many packs Roger needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of people (18) by the number of pouches in each pack (6)
* 18 people / 6 pouches per pack = 3 packs
