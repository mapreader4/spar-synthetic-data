Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* The easy round is worth 2 points per correct answer
* Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy round
* So for the easy round, Kim's points are:
    - 6 correct answers x 2 points per answer = 12 points

* The average round is worth 3 points per correct answer
* Kim got 2 correct answers in the average round
* So for the average round, Kim's points are:
    - 2 correct answers x 3 points per answer = 6 points

* The hard round is worth 5 points per correct answer
* Kim got 4 correct answers in the hard round
* So for the hard round, Kim's points are:
    - 4 correct answers x 5 points per answer = 20 points

* To calculate Kim's total points, we add up the points from each round:
    - 12 points (easy) + 6 points (average) + 20 points (hard) = 38 total points

Answer: 38
