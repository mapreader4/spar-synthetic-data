Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Amanda needs to sell 80 tickets in total
* On the first day, she sold 5 of her friends 4 tickets each, which is 5 x 4 = 20 tickets
* On the second day, she sold 32 tickets
* So the total number of tickets sold so far is 20 + 32 = 52 tickets
* To meet her goal of 80 tickets, she needs to sell the remaining 80 - 52 = 28 tickets on the third day.

Answer: 28
