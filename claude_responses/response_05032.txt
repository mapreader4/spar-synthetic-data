Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The battery charger can fully charge a smartphone in 26 minutes
* The battery charger can fully charge a tablet in 53 minutes
* Ana charged her tablet fully and her phone halfway
* To charge the tablet fully, it would take 53 minutes
* To charge the phone halfway, it would take half the time it takes to charge the phone fully, which is 26 / 2 = 13 minutes
* Therefore, the total time it took to charge the tablet fully and the phone halfway is 53 minutes + 13 minutes = 66 minutes

Answer: 66 minutes
