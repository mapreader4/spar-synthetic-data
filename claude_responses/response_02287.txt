Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason counted 4 times as many green cars as red cars
* He also counted 6 more red cars than purple cars
* The total number of cars he counted was 312

Let's use variables to represent the number of each color of car:
* Let x = the number of red cars
* Then the number of green cars is 4x
* And the number of purple cars is x - 6

We know the total number of cars is 312, so we can set up an equation:
* x + 4x + (x - 6) = 312
* 6x - 6 = 312
* 6x = 318
* x = 53

So the number of red cars is 53.
Since there are 6 more red cars than purple cars, the number of purple cars is:
* 53 - 6 = 47

Answer: 47
