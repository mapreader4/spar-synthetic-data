Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pizzeria sells small pizzas for $2 and large pizzas for $8
* They sold a total of $40 in pizzas
* They sold 8 small pizzas

To find the number of large pizzas they sold, we can set up an equation:
* Let x = the number of large pizzas sold
* Small pizzas sold = 8
* Total revenue = (8 * $2) + (x * $8) = $16 + $8x
* Total revenue = $40
* $16 + $8x = $40
* $8x = $24
* x = 3

Therefore, the pizzeria sold 3 large pizzas.
