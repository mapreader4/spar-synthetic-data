Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 60% of the employees are women, and the rest are men
* So, if 60% are women, then 40% are men
* Of the men, 75% have a college degree, and 8 do not
* To find the number of men without a college degree, we can use the information that 8 do not have a degree
* If 75% of the men have a degree, then 25% do not
* So, the number of men without a degree is 25% of the total number of men
* Let's call the total number of employees "x"
* Then the number of men is 0.4x, and the number of men without a degree is 0.25 * 0.4x = 0.1x
* Since we know that 8 men do not have a degree, we can set up the equation: 0.1x = 8
* Solving for x, we get x = 80
* So the total number of employees is 80
* And the number of women is 60% of 80, which is 48

Answer: 48
