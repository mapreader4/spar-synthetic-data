Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. John can front squat 80% as much as he back squats.
2. He used to back squat 200 kg, but increased that by 50 kg. So, his new back squat is 200 kg + 50 kg = 250 kg.
3. Since he can front squat 80% of his back squat, his front squat is 80% of 250 kg, which is 0.8 * 250 kg = 200 kg.
4. He can do a triple equal to 90% of the amount he front squats. So, the weight he can move for three triples is 90% of 200 kg, which is 0.9 * 200 kg = 180 kg.

Answer: 180 kg
