Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first tree grows 1 meter per day. In 4 days, it will grow 1 meter x 4 days = 4 meters.

2. The second tree grows the same amount as the first tree, but in half the time. So, it grows 1 meter every 2 days. In 4 days, it will grow 2 meters.

3. The third tree grows 2 meters per day. In 4 days, it will grow 2 meters x 4 days = 8 meters.

4. The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third tree each day. So, it grows 3 meters per day. In 4 days, it will grow 3 meters x 4 days = 12 meters.

Now, we add up the total growth of all four trees:
4 meters + 2 meters + 8 meters + 12 meters = 26 meters

Answer: 26
