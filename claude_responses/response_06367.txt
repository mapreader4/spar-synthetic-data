Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bert buys the products in the warehouse and sells them for $10 more in his shop.
2) The client bought a barrel for $90 in Bert's shop.
3) Bert has to pay 10% of the value in tax for each sale.
4) To find Bert's profit, we need to first find the cost of the barrel in the warehouse.
5) Since Bert sells the barrel for $90, and he adds $10 to the cost, the cost in the warehouse must have been $80.
6) Bert has to pay 10% of $80 in tax, which is $8.
7) Bert's profit is the selling price ($90) minus the cost in the warehouse ($80) and the tax ($8).
8) Bert's profit = $90 - $80 - $8 = $2.

Answer: $2.
