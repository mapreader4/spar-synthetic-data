Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joan has a total of $60 to spend
* She is going to purchase:
  - 2 containers of hummus at $5 each, so that's $10 total
  - Chicken for $20
  - Bacon for $10
  - Vegetables for $10
* So the total of those purchases is:
  - $10 (hummus) + $20 (chicken) + $10 (bacon) + $10 (vegetables) = $50
* She has $60 total, and she has spent $50 so far
* So the remaining amount she has to spend is $60 - $50 = $10
* Apples cost $2 each
* With the remaining $10, she can purchase $10 / $2 = 5 apples
