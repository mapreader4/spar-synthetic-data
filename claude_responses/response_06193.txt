Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Clinton has twice as many shoes as belts. This means that if he has x belts, he has 2x shoes.
2) He has 2 more belts than hats, and he has 5 hats. This means he has 7 belts (5 hats + 2 more).
3) Since he has twice as many shoes as belts, and he has 7 belts, he has 2 * 7 = 14 shoes.
