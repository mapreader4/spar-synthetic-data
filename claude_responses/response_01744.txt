Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The farmer harvested 250 potatoes and bundled them in twenty-five's. 
   * 250 potatoes / 25 per bundle = 10 bundles
   * Each bundle was sold for $1.90
   * 10 bundles x $1.90 per bundle = $19.00 from the potatoes

2. The farmer harvested 320 carrots and bundled them in twenty's.
   * 320 carrots / 20 per bundle = 16 bundles
   * Each bundle was sold for $2.00
   * 16 bundles x $2.00 per bundle = $32.00 from the carrots

3. To calculate the total amount the farmer got from selling all his harvested crops:
   * Total from potatoes: $19.00
   * Total from carrots: $32.00
   * Total amount: $19.00 + $32.00 = $51.00
