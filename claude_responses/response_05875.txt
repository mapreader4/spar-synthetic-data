Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder.
2) Duane had 42 pages in his binder.
3) Duane took half of the 42 pages out and gave them to Lana.
4) To find how many pages Duane gave to Lana, we take half of 42: 42 / 2 = 21 pages.
5) Lana originally had 8 pages, and Duane gave her 21 pages.
6) So the total number of pages Lana has in her binder after adding Duane's is: 8 + 21 = 29 pages.

Answer: 29
