Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp.
2) Austin's trap caught 8 less than Victor's, so Austin's trap caught 26 - 8 = 18 shrimp.
3) The total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin is 26 + 18 = 44 shrimp.
4) Brian's trap caught half of Victor and Austin's total, so Brian's trap caught 44 / 2 = 22 shrimp.
5) The total number of shrimp caught by all three boys is 26 + 18 + 22 = 66 shrimp.
6) They sold the shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp.
7) 66 shrimp / 11 shrimp per $7 = 6 groups of $7, so the total earnings are 6 * $7 = $42.
8) They divided the earnings equally amongst themselves, so each boy made $42 / 3 = $14.

Answer: $14
