Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 40 houses on one side of the main road.
2) There are three times as many homes on the other side of the road.
3) To calculate the number of homes on the other side of the road, we take the 40 homes on one side and multiply by 3:
   40 x 3 = 120 homes on the other side of the road.
4) To find the total number of homes in Mariam's neighborhood, we add the 40 homes on one side and the 120 homes on the other side:
   40 + 120 = 160 homes.

Answer: 160
