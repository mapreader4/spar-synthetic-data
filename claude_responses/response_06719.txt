Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 45 children in the classroom.
2) One-third of the children are girls. To find the number of girls, we can divide the total number of children by 3:
45 รท 3 = 15 girls
3) Since there are 45 children total, and 15 of them are girls, the remaining children must be boys.
4) To find the number of boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of children:
45 - 15 = 30 boys

Answer: 30
