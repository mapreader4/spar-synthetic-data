To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sacks of strawberries Antoine needs to supply to all the bakeries in 4 weeks.

Given information:
- The first bakery needs 2 sacks of strawberries per week.
- The second bakery needs 4 sacks of strawberries per week.
- The third bakery needs 12 sacks of strawberries per week.
- The time period is 4 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sacks of strawberries needed per week.
Sacks needed by the first bakery per week = 2
Sacks needed by the second bakery per week = 4
Sacks needed by the third bakery per week = 12
Total sacks needed per week = 2 + 4 + 12 = 18 sacks

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sacks of strawberries needed in 4 weeks.
Total sacks needed in 4 weeks = Total sacks needed per week × 4 weeks
Total sacks needed in 4 weeks = 18 sacks × 4 weeks = 72 sacks

Answer: 72 sacks
