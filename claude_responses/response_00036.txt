Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total amount earned from washing cars: $60
* Lisa earned half of the total, which is $60 / 2 = $30
* Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, which is $30 / 2 = $15
* The difference between what Lisa earned and what Tommy earned is $30 - $15 = $15

Answer: $15
