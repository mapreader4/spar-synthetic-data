Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In Sam's first 100 matches, he won 50% of them.
* 50% of 100 matches is 50 matches won.
* In his next 100 matches, he won 60% of them.
* 60% of 100 matches is 60 matches won.
* To find the total number of matches he won, we add the number of matches won in the first 100 and the number of matches won in the next 100:
* 50 + 60 = 110 matches won.

Answer: 110
