Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mike ate 20 chocolate squares.
2) Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate.
3) To find the number of chocolate squares that Jenny ate, we need to first find thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate.
4) Thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate is 3 x 20 = 60.
5) Jenny ate 5 more than 60, so she ate 60 + 5 = 65 chocolate squares.

Answer: 65
