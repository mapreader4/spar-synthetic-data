Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Abigail collected 2 boxes of cookies
* Each box contains 48 cookies
* So Abigail collected 2 x 48 = 96 cookies
* Grayson collected 3/4 of a box
* 3/4 of 48 cookies is 36 cookies
* Olivia collected 3 boxes
* 3 x 48 = 144 cookies
* To find the total cookies collected, we add up the amounts from each person:
* 96 + 36 + 144 = 276 cookies

Answer: 276
