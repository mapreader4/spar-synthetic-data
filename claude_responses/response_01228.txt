Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The paint mixer makes an equal number of drums of paint each day
* In 3 days, the paint mixer makes 18 drums of paint
* This means that the paint mixer makes 6 drums of paint per day (18 drums / 3 days = 6 drums per day)
* The question asks how many days it will take the paint mixer to make 360 drums of paint
* To find this, we need to divide the total number of drums (360) by the number of drums made per day (6)
* 360 drums / 6 drums per day = 60 days

Answer: 60
