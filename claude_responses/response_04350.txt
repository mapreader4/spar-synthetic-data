Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cindy had 500 marbles in total
* She gave 80 marbles to each of her four friends
* To calculate the number of marbles given away:
  - 80 marbles per friend x 4 friends = 320 marbles given away
* To calculate the number of marbles Cindy has remaining:
  - 500 marbles - 320 marbles given away = 180 marbles remaining
* The question asks for four times the number of marbles Cindy has remaining
  - 4 x 180 marbles = 720 marbles

Answer: 720
