Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 192 soaps in a package
* They put the soaps in 2 big boxes
* Each box contains 6 packages
* To find the total number of soaps in the 2 boxes, we need to:
1. Find the number of soaps in each box
2. Multiply that by the number of boxes (2)

Step 1: Finding the number of soaps in each box
* Each box contains 6 packages
* Each package contains 192 soaps
* So, each box contains 6 * 192 = 1,152 soaps

Step 2: Finding the total number of soaps in the 2 boxes
* There are 2 boxes
* Each box contains 1,152 soaps
* So, the total number of soaps in the 2 boxes is 2 * 1,152 = 2,304 soaps

Answer: 2,304
