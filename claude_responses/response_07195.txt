Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dorchester is paid $40 per day
* He also earns $2.25 for each puppy he washes
* On Wednesday, he earned $76 total

To find the number of puppies he washed, we need to first find the amount he earned from the base pay of $40 per day, and then subtract that from the total earnings to find the amount he earned from washing puppies.

* Base pay for the day = $40
* Amount earned from washing puppies = Total earnings - Base pay
* Amount earned from washing puppies = $76 - $40 = $36

Now, we can divide the amount earned from washing puppies by the rate of $2.25 per puppy to find the number of puppies he washed.

* Number of puppies washed = Amount earned from washing puppies / Rate per puppy
* Number of puppies washed = $36 / $2.25 = 16 puppies

Answer: 16 puppies
