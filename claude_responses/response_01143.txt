Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The price of a wooden toy is $20
* The price of a hat is $10
* Kendra bought 2 wooden toys and 3 hats
* To calculate the total cost of the items Kendra bought:
    - 2 wooden toys at $20 each = $40
    - 3 hats at $10 each = $30
    - Total cost = $40 + $30 = $70
* Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill
* To calculate the change Kendra received:
    - Kendra paid $100
    - The total cost of the items was $70
    - The change Kendra received is $100 - $70 = $30

Answer: 30
