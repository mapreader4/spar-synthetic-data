Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* James loses twice as many calories per hour when dancing compared to walking
* He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time
* He does this 4 times a week
* He burned 300 calories per hour when walking

First, let's calculate how many calories he loses per hour when dancing:
* He loses twice as many calories per hour when dancing compared to walking
* So, if he burned 300 calories per hour walking, he would burn 600 calories per hour dancing

Next, let's calculate how many calories he loses per day from dancing:
* He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time
* So, he dances for a total of 1 hour per day
* He loses 600 calories per hour when dancing
* So, he loses 600 calories per day from dancing

Finally, let's calculate how many calories he loses per week from dancing:
* He dances 4 times a week
* He loses 600 calories per day from dancing
* So, he loses 600 x 4 = 2,400 calories per week from dancing

Answer: 2,400
