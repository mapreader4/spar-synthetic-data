Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. James initially bought $3000 worth of stuff from Amazon.

2. He then returned a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500. This means he got a refund of $1200 for the returned items.

3. He then sold another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned. The bike he returned cost $500, so the bike he sold cost $500 + (20% of $500) = $600.
He sold this bike for 80% of what he bought it for, which is 0.8 * $600 = $480.

4. Finally, he bought a toaster for $100.

Now, let's calculate the total amount James is out of pocket:
* Initial purchase: $3000
* Refund for returned items: -$1200
* Bike sold: -$480
* Toaster purchased: +$100

Adding these up, we get:
$3000 - $1200 - $480 + $100 = $1420

Answer: $1420
