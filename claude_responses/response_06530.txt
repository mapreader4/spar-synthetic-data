Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Charles bought 20 papers to draw
* Today, he drew 6 pictures
* Yesterday, he drew 6 pictures before going to work, and some more pictures when he came back
* We know that he has 2 papers left

To find the number of pictures he drew when he came back from work, we can use the following logic:
* He started with 20 papers
* He used 6 papers today and 6 papers yesterday before going to work
* That means he used a total of 12 papers so far
* He has 2 papers left
* So the number of papers he used when he came back from work is:
    - Total papers (20) - Papers used so far (12) - Papers left (2) = 6 papers

Therefore, the number of pictures he drew when he came back from work is:
Answer: 6
