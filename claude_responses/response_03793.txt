Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total cost of the vacation includes the Airbnb rental ($3200) and the car rental ($800).
2) The total cost is $3200 + $800 = $4000.
3) The vacation is for 8 people.
4) To find each person's share, we divide the total cost ($4000) by the number of people (8).
5) $4000 / 8 = $500.

Answer: 500
