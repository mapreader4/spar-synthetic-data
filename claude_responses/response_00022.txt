Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name.
2) If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's.
3) Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey, which has 10 letters.
4) So, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, it would be 5 letters long (10 / 2 = 5).
5) Therefore, Bobbie's original last name must have been 7 letters long (5 + 2 = 7).
6) Since Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's, Samantha's last name must be 4 letters long (7 - 3 = 4).
