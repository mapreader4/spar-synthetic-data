Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alice has 60 pens.
2) Clara has 2/5 times as many pens as Alice. So, Clara has 2/5 * 60 = 24 pens.
3) The difference in the number of pens that Alice and Clara each have matches their age difference. So, the age difference between Alice and Clara is 60 - 24 = 36.
4) Alice's age is 20, and Clara is older than Alice. So, Clara's current age is 20 + 36 = 56.
5) The question asks for Clara's age in 5 years to come. So, Clara's age in 5 years will be 56 + 5 = 61.

Answer: 61
