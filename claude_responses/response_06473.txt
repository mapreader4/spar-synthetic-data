Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bobby buys 2 packets of candy
* He eats 2 candies every day from Monday through Friday (5 days)
* That's 2 candies x 5 days = 10 candies per week
* He eats 1 candy each during the remaining days of the week (Saturday and Sunday)
* That's 1 candy x 2 days = 2 candies per week
* So in total, he eats 10 + 2 = 12 candies per week
* It takes him 3 such weeks to finish the 2 packets
* Therefore, the total number of candies he eats is 12 candies per week x 3 weeks = 36 candies

Answer: 18 candies per packet
