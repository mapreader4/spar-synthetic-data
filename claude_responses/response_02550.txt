Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Nancy earns $28 for working 4 hours.
2) This means her hourly rate is $28 / 4 = $7 per hour.
3) We want to know how many hours she needs to work to earn $70.
4) To calculate this, we can divide the desired earnings ($70) by her hourly rate ($7 per hour).
5) $70 / $7 per hour = 10 hours.
