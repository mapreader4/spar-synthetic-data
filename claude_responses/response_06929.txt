Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Matt initially has 8 baseball cards worth $6 each.
2. The total value of Matt's 8 cards is: 8 cards x $6 per card = $48.
3. Matt trades 2 of his $6 cards to Jane in exchange for 3 $2 cards and 1 $9 card.
4. The value of the cards Matt receives from Jane is: (3 x $2) + $9 = $15.
5. The value of the 2 cards Matt traded to Jane is: 2 x $6 = $12.
6. The profit Matt makes is the difference between the value of the cards he received ($15) and the value of the cards he traded ($12).
7. The profit is: $15 - $12 = $3.
