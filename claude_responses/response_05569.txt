Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The distance of the trip is 2,790 miles
* The friends drove at a constant speed of 62 miles/hour
* They took breaks of 30 minutes every 5 hours
* They spent an additional 30 minutes looking for the hotel once they arrived in the city

First, let's calculate the total driving time:
* Distance / Speed = Time
* 2,790 miles / 62 miles/hour = 45 hours

Now, let's account for the breaks:
* They took 30-minute breaks every 5 hours
* 45 hours / 5 hours = 9 breaks
* 9 breaks x 30 minutes = 270 minutes = 4.5 hours

Finally, let's add the time spent looking for the hotel:
* 45 hours + 4.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 50 hours

Answer: 50 hours
