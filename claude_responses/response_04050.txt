Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick did.
2) Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus.
3) Ollie caught 5 fish.
4) Since Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus, we can say that Angus caught 5 + 7 = 12 fish.
5) Since Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick, we can say that Patrick caught 12 - 4 = 8 fish.
