Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The park has 50 benches, and each bench can hold 4 people.
2) The total capacity of all the benches is 50 benches * 4 people per bench = 200 people.
3) On the Sunday afternoon, 80 people were sitting on the benches.
4) To find the number of available spaces, we take the total capacity (200 people) and subtract the number of people currently sitting on the benches (80 people).
5) 200 people - 80 people = 120 available spaces.

Answer: 120
