Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Patricia and Geoffrey caught:
- 1 eight-pound trout
- 6 two-pound bass
- 2 twelve-pound salmon
2) To calculate the total weight of the fish caught:
- Trout: 8 pounds
- Bass: 6 x 2 pounds = 12 pounds
- Salmon: 2 x 12 pounds = 24 pounds
3) The total weight of the fish caught is:
8 + 12 + 24 = 44 pounds
4) Each person will eat 2 pounds of fish.
5) To calculate how many campers they can feed, we divide the total weight of the fish (44 pounds) by the amount each person will eat (2 pounds):
44 pounds / 2 pounds per person = 22 campers
Answer: 22
