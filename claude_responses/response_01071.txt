Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) David swims the 100-meter freestyle in 48 seconds.
2) He swims the 100-meter backstroke 4 seconds slower than the freestyle, so that's 48 + 4 = 52 seconds.
3) He swims the 100-meter butterfly 3 seconds slower than the backstroke, so that's 52 + 3 = 55 seconds.
4) He swims the 100-meter breaststroke 2 seconds slower than the butterfly, so that's 55 + 2 = 57 seconds.
5) To get the combined length of time, we add up the times for each event:
48 + 52 + 55 + 57 = 212 seconds.

Answer: 212
