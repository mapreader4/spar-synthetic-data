Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Guise ate 10 hot dogs.
* On Tuesday, he ate 2 more hot dogs than the previous day, which is 10 + 2 = 12 hot dogs.
* On Wednesday, he ate 2 more hot dogs than the previous day, which is 12 + 2 = 14 hot dogs.

To find the total number of hot dogs Guise had eaten by Wednesday, we add up the number of hot dogs he ate each day:
* Monday: 10 hot dogs
* Tuesday: 12 hot dogs
* Wednesday: 14 hot dogs

Total hot dogs eaten by Wednesday = 10 + 12 + 14 = 36 hot dogs.

Answer: 36
