Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* We have 4 tires and 1 battery that together cost $224
* Each tire costs $42
* To find the cost of the battery, we need to subtract the total cost of the 4 tires from the total cost of $224

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 tires:
* 4 tires x $42 per tire = $168

Now, we can subtract the total cost of the tires from the total cost of $224 to find the cost of the battery:
* $224 - $168 = $56

Therefore, the price of the battery is $56.

Answer: $56
