Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brendan caught 8 fish in the morning.
2) He threw 3 of them back that were too small.
3) So, Brendan kept 8 - 3 = 5 fish from the morning.
4) Brendan caught 5 more fish in the afternoon.
5) So, the total number of fish Brendan caught is 5 + 5 = 10.
6) Brendan's dad caught 13 fish.
7) To find the total number of fish they caught, we add Brendan's 10 fish and his dad's 13 fish:
10 + 13 = 23.

Answer: 23
