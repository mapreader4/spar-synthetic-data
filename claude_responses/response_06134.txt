Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 200 students on the field
* 3/4 of the students looked up at the plane
* To find how many students looked up, we take 3/4 of 200:
* 3/4 of 200 = 0.75 * 200 = 150 students looked up
* Each student has 2 eyes
* So the total number of eyes that saw the airplane is:
* 150 students x 2 eyes per student = 300 eyes

Answer: 300
