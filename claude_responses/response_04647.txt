Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Monica put $15 into her moneybox every week
* It took 60 weeks for the moneybox to get full
* So, in each full moneybox, Monica had saved $15 x 60 = $900
* Monica repeated this whole process 5 times
* Therefore, the total amount of money Monica took to the bank is:
* 5 x $900 = $4,500

Answer: 4,500
