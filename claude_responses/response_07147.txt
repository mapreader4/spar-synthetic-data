Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jed starts with 20 cards
* Every week, he gets 6 new cards
* Every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends

To find out how many weeks it will take for Jed to have a total of 40 cards, we need to calculate the net gain in cards per week and then determine how many weeks it will take to reach 40 cards.

Net gain per week:
* Jed gets 6 cards per week
* He gives 2 cards every two weeks, which is 1 card per week
* Net gain per week = 6 - 1 = 5 cards

Now, we need to find how many weeks it will take to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, given the net gain of 5 cards per week.
* Gain needed = 40 - 20 = 20 cards
* Weeks needed = 20 cards / 5 cards per week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jed 4 weeks to have a total of 40 cards.
