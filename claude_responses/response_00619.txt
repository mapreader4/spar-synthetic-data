Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Harry walks 7 dogs each day
* That's 7 dogs x 3 days = 21 dogs
* On Tuesday, Harry walks 12 dogs
* On Thursday, Harry walks 9 dogs
* In total for the week, Harry walks:
  - 21 dogs (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
  - 12 dogs (Tuesday)
  - 9 dogs (Thursday)
* That's a total of 21 + 12 + 9 = 42 dogs walked in a week
* Harry is paid $5 for each dog he walks
* So, the total amount of money Harry earns in a week is:
  - 42 dogs x $5 per dog = $210

Answer: $210
