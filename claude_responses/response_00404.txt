Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month.
2) This year, the farmer planted an additional 7 acres of grass.
3) The farmer owns 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day.
4) The farmer will start feeding the horses this year's hay beginning the first day of September.

To calculate the number of bales of hay the farmer would have left by the end of December, we need to:
1) Calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested this year.
2) Calculate the total number of bales of hay consumed by the horses from September 1 to December 31.
3) Subtract the number of bales consumed from the total bales harvested.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested this year.
The farmer has 12 acres of grass this year (5 acres + 7 acres), and each acre yields 560 bales of hay per month.
Total bales of hay harvested this year = 12 acres x 560 bales/acre x 4 months (September to December) = 26,880 bales.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bales of hay consumed by the horses from September 1 to December 31.
Each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day, and there are 9 horses.
Total bales of hay consumed by the horses = 9 horses x 3 bales/day x 122 days (September 1 to December 31) = 3,294 bales.

Step 3: Subtract the number of bales consumed from the total bales harvested.
Bales of hay left by the end of December = 26,880 bales - 3,294 bales = 23,586 bales.

Answer: 23,586 bales.
