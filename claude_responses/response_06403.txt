Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The archer shoots 200 shots 4 days a week, so that's 200 shots x 4 days = 800 shots per week.
2) The archer is able to recover 20% of his arrows, so that means 80% of the arrows are lost.
3) 80% of 800 shots is 640 lost arrows per week.
4) The arrows cost $5.5 per arrow, so the total cost of the lost arrows per week is 640 x $5.5 = $3,520.
5) The team agrees to pay for 70% of the cost of the arrows, so the archer's share is 30% of $3,520, which is $1,056.

Answer: $1,056
