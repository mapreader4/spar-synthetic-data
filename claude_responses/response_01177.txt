Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James rents his car for $20 per hour
* He rents it for 8 hours a day
* He rents it for 4 days a week

To calculate his weekly earnings, we need to:
1. Calculate his daily earnings
2. Multiply his daily earnings by the number of days per week

Step 1: Calculate his daily earnings
* Rental rate per hour: $20
* Hours rented per day: 8 hours
* Daily earnings = $20 per hour x 8 hours = $160 per day

Step 2: Calculate his weekly earnings
* Days rented per week: 4 days
* Weekly earnings = $160 per day x 4 days = $640 per week

Answer: $640
