Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John had to fix 20 computers in total
* 20% of the 20 computers were unfixable
* To calculate the number of unfixable computers:
  * 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 computers
* 40% of the 20 computers needed to wait a few days for spare parts
* To calculate the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts:
  * 40% of 20 = 0.40 * 20 = 8 computers
* The rest of the computers, which were not unfixable and did not need to wait for spare parts, were able to be fixed right away
* To calculate the number of computers John was able to fix right away:
  * Total computers (20) - Unfixable computers (4) - Computers needing spare parts (8) = 8 computers

Answer: 8
