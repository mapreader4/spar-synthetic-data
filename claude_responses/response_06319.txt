Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The normal retail price of each pair of pants is $45.
2) The store is running a 20% off sale, so the discounted price of each pair of pants is $45 - (20% of $45) = $45 - $9 = $36 per pair.
3) Jean needs to buy 10 pairs of pants, so the total cost before tax is 10 x $36 = $360.
4) There is a 10% tax, so the total amount Jean will need to pay is $360 + (10% of $360) = $360 + $36 = $396.

Answer: $396
