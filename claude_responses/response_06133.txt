Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jaxon got 15 toys
* Gabriel has twice as many toys as Jaxon, so Gabriel has 2 * 15 = 30 toys
* Jerry has 8 more toys than Gabriel, so Jerry has 30 + 8 = 38 toys

Now, to find the total number of toys they all have, we add up the number of toys for each child:
* Jaxon: 15 toys
* Gabriel: 30 toys
* Jerry: 38 toys

Total number of toys = 15 + 30 + 38 = 83

Answer: 83
