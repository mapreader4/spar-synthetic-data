Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 8 loads of laundry that need to be washed
* Each load takes 45 minutes in the wash cycle
* Each load takes 1 hour in the dry cycle
* To calculate the total time for the wash cycle:
  - 8 loads x 45 minutes per load = 360 minutes
  - 360 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 6 hours
* To calculate the total time for the dry cycle:
  - 8 loads x 1 hour per load = 8 hours
* To calculate the total time to complete the entire set of laundry:
  - Wash cycle time + Dry cycle time = 6 hours + 8 hours = 14 hours

Answer: 14 hours
