Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The total number of apples in the batch is 30.
2) 1/6 of the apples are too small. 1/6 of 30 is 5, so 5 apples are too small.
3) 1/3 of the apples are not ripe. 1/3 of 30 is 10, so 10 apples are not ripe.
4) The remaining apples are perfect. To find the number of perfect apples, we need to subtract the number of apples that are too small and not ripe from the total number of apples.
5) 30 - 5 - 10 = 15 perfect apples.

Answer: 15
