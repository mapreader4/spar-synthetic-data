Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eliza has 4 siblings, so there are 5 siblings in total
* The total height of all 5 siblings combined is 330 inches
* Two of the siblings are both 66 inches tall
* Another sibling is 60 inches tall
* Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling

First, let's calculate the total height of the three siblings we know the heights of:
* 66 inches + 66 inches + 60 inches = 192 inches

Now, we know the total height of all 5 siblings is 330 inches, so the height of the remaining two siblings must be:
* 330 inches - 192 inches = 138 inches

Since Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling, we can calculate Eliza's height as:
* 138 inches - 2 inches = 136 inches

Answer: 136 inches
