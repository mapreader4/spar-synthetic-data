Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hershel initially has 10 betta fish and 15 goldfish in the bowl.
2) Bexley brings 2/5 times as many betta fish as Hershel, which is 2/5 * 10 = 4 betta fish.
3) Bexley also brings 1/3 times as many goldfish as Hershel, which is 1/3 * 15 = 5 goldfish.
4) So the total number of fish in the bowl is now 10 + 4 + 15 + 5 = 34 fish.
5) Hershel then gifts 1/2 of the fish to his sister, which is 1/2 * 34 = 17 fish.
6) The remaining number of fish in the bowl is 34 - 17 = 17 fish.
