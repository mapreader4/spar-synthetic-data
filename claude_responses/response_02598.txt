Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dina has 60 dolls
2) Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy
   * So, if Dina has 60 dolls and Dina has twice as many as Ivy, then Ivy must have 30 dolls (60 / 2 = 30)
3) 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions
   * Ivy has 30 dolls total
   * 2/3 of 30 is 20 (30 * 2/3 = 20)
   * Therefore, Ivy has 20 collectors edition dolls

Answer: 20
