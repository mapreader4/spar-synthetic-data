Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Stacy bought a 6-month prescription of flea & tick medicine for $150.00
* Her cashback app was offering 10% cashback
* She has a mail-in rebate for $25.00 on a 6-month prescription

First, let's calculate the cashback amount:
* 10% of $150.00 = $15.00

Now, let's subtract the cashback amount from the original cost:
* $150.00 - $15.00 = $135.00

Finally, let's subtract the $25.00 mail-in rebate from the remaining cost:
* $135.00 - $25.00 = $110.00

Answer: $110
