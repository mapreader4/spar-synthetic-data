Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Remy sold 55 bottles of soda in the morning.
2) Nick sold 6 fewer bottles than Remy, so Nick sold 55 - 6 = 49 bottles of soda in the morning.
3) The price per bottle is $0.50.
4) So Remy's morning sales were 55 bottles x $0.50 = $27.50.
5) Nick's morning sales were 49 bottles x $0.50 = $24.50.
6) The total morning sales were $27.50 + $24.50 = $52.
7) The total evening sales were $55.
8) The difference between the evening sales and the morning sales is $55 - $52 = $3.

Answer: $3.
