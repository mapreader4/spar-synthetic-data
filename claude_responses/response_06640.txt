Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Noah calls his Grammy every week
* Each call lasts 30 minutes
* He is charged $0.05 per call minute

To calculate the total cost for a year, we need to:
1. Calculate the total minutes of calls in a year
2. Multiply the total minutes by the cost per minute

First, let's calculate the total minutes of calls in a year:
* 30 minutes per call
* 52 weeks in a year
* 30 minutes x 52 weeks = 1,560 minutes per year

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
* 1,560 minutes per year
* $0.05 per minute
* 1,560 minutes x $0.05 per minute = $78

Therefore, the total amount Noah would be billed for a year of calls to his Grammy is:

Answer: $78
