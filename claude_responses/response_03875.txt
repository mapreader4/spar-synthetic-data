Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first snail raced at a speed of 2 feet per minute.
* The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail, which means it raced at 4 feet per minute (2 x 2 = 4).
* The third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail, which means it raced at 20 feet per minute (4 x 5 = 20).
* The first snail took 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.
* Since the third snail raced at 20 feet per minute, and the first snail took 20 minutes, we can calculate the distance the sidewalk as 2 feet per minute x 20 minutes = 40 feet.
* Therefore, the third snail, racing at 20 feet per minute, would take 40 feet / 20 feet per minute = 2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.

Answer: 2 minutes
