Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The ratio of white to black scores is 7:6
2) This means that for every 13 total scores, 7 are white and 6 are black
3) Since Taylor got 78 yellow scores, we can find the total number of scores used:
   * 78 yellow scores = 7 white scores + 6 black scores
   * Total scores = 78 / (7/13) = 182
4) Now we can find the number of white and black scores used:
   * White scores = 7/13 * 182 = 98
   * Black scores = 6/13 * 182 = 84
5) The difference between the number of black and white scores is:
   * 84 - 98 = -14
6) 2/3 of -14 is:
   * 2/3 * -14 = -9.33

Answer: -9
