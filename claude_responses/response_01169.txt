Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ben has 4 boxes with 10 basketball cards in each box. That means he has 4 x 10 = 40 basketball cards.
2) His mother gave him 5 boxes with 8 baseball cards in each box. That means he has 5 x 8 = 40 baseball cards.
3) In total, he has 40 basketball cards + 40 baseball cards = 80 cards.
4) He gives 58 cards to his classmates.
5) To find how many cards he has left, we subtract the number of cards he gave away from the total number of cards he had:
80 cards - 58 cards = 22 cards.

Answer: 22
