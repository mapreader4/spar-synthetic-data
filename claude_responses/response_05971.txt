Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Matt can buy key chains in packs of 10 for $20 or in packs of 4 for $12.
2) He wants to buy 20 key chains.
3) If he buys them in packs of 10, he would need to buy 2 packs, which would cost 2 * $20 = $40.
4) If he buys them in packs of 4, he would need to buy 5 packs, which would cost 5 * $12 = $60.
5) The difference between the two prices is $60 - $40 = $20.
6) Therefore, Matt can save $20 if he chooses to buy 20 key chains at the lower price.

Answer: 20
