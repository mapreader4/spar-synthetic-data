Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 18 red blocks in Jacob's toy bin
* There are 7 more yellow blocks than red blocks
* So, the number of yellow blocks is 18 + 7 = 25
* There are 14 more blue blocks than red blocks
* So, the number of blue blocks is 18 + 14 = 32
* To find the total number of blocks, we add the red, yellow, and blue blocks:
* 18 red blocks + 25 yellow blocks + 32 blue blocks = 75 blocks

Answer: 75
