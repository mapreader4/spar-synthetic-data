Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Friday, a shipment of 1000 kg of tomatoes arrived at the store.
* On Saturday, Marta sold a total of 300 kg of tomatoes to customers.
* On Sunday, the store was closed, causing 200 kg of tomatoes to rot and be thrown away.
* On Monday, another shipment arrived, twice the size of the first one, which means 2000 kg of tomatoes.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of tomatoes Marta had ready for sale on Tuesday:
* Starting amount on Friday: 1000 kg
* Minus amount sold on Saturday: 1000 kg - 300 kg = 700 kg
* Minus amount rotted on Sunday: 700 kg - 200 kg = 500 kg
* Plus new shipment on Monday: 500 kg + 2000 kg = 2500 kg

Answer: 2500 kg
