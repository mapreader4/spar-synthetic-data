Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Normally, it takes Matthew:
   - 1 hour to assemble the ingredients
   - 1.5 hours to bake the cakes
   - 1 hour to decorate the cakes
   - Total normal time = 1 + 1.5 + 1 = 3.5 hours

2. On the day when the oven failed to reach the correct temperature, the baking time took twice as long, which is:
   - Baking time = 1.5 hours x 2 = 3 hours

3. So the total time on the day when the oven failed would be:
   - Assemble ingredients: 1 hour
   - Bake the cakes: 3 hours
   - Decorate the cakes: 1 hour
   - Total time = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 hours

Answer: 5 hours
