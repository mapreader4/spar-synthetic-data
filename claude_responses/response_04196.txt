Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The gecko lays 30 eggs per year.
2) 20% of the 30 eggs are infertile. 20% of 30 is 0.2 * 30 = 6 infertile eggs.
3) That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 fertile eggs.
4) A third of the 24 fertile eggs will not hatch due to calcification issues. One third of 24 is 24 / 3 = 8 eggs that will not hatch.
5) The number of eggs that will actually hatch is the total number of fertile eggs (24) minus the number that will not hatch due to calcification (8).
