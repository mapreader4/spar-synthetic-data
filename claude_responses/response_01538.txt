Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, Marcus paints 2 paintings.
* Each day after, he paints twice as many paintings as the previous day.
* He paints for 5 days total.

So, the number of paintings he paints each day is:
* Day 1: 2 paintings
* Day 2: 2 x 2 = 4 paintings
* Day 3: 4 x 2 = 8 paintings
* Day 4: 8 x 2 = 16 paintings
* Day 5: 16 x 2 = 32 paintings

To calculate the total number of paintings he has painted, we add up the paintings from each day:
* 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 paintings

Answer: 62
