Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Beth is currently 18 years old
* Her little sister is currently 5 years old
* We need to find out how many years it will take for Beth to be twice her sister's age
* To be twice her sister's age, Beth would need to be 10 years old (2 x 5 = 10)
* So we need to find out how many years it will take for Beth to be 10 years older than she is now
* Beth is currently 18 years old, and she needs to be 10 years older, so she needs to be 28 years old
* 28 years old - 18 years old = 10 years
* Therefore, it will take 10 years for Beth to be twice her sister's age.

Answer: 10
