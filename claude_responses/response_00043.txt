Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse.
* Each subsequent earthquake would cause double the number of buildings to collapse compared to the previous earthquake.

So, let's calculate the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake:
* Earthquake 1: 4 buildings collapsed
* Earthquake 2: 4 x 2 = 8 buildings collapsed
* Earthquake 3: 8 x 2 = 16 buildings collapsed
* Earthquake 4: 16 x 2 = 32 buildings collapsed

Now, we add up the total number of buildings that collapsed:
4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60

Answer: 60
