Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Hank gave Delphine a box of 24 chocolates.

2. On the first day, Delphine ate 4 chocolates.
   * Chocolates remaining: 24 - 4 = 20

3. On the second day, she ate 3 less than twice as many chocolates as she ate the first day.
   * Chocolates eaten on the second day: 2 x 4 - 3 = 5
   * Chocolates remaining: 20 - 5 = 15

4. On the third day, she ate two less than the number she ate on the first day.
   * Chocolates eaten on the third day: 4 - 2 = 2
   * Chocolates remaining: 15 - 2 = 13

5. On the fourth day, she ate one less than she ate the previous day.
   * Chocolates eaten on the fourth day: 2 - 1 = 1
   * Chocolates remaining: 13 - 1 = 12

6. On the fifth day, how many chocolates remained uneaten?
   * Chocolates remaining: 12

Answer: 12
