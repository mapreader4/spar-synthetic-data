Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Barry has $10.00 worth of dimes.
2) Since each dime is worth $0.10, we can calculate the number of dimes Barry has:
$10.00 / $0.10 = 100 dimes

3) Dan has half the amount of dimes that Barry has.
Half of 100 dimes is 50 dimes.

4) Dan then finds 2 more dimes on his way home from school.
50 dimes + 2 dimes = 52 dimes.

Answer: 52 dimes.
