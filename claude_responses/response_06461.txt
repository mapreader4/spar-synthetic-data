Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) John had $200 to start with.
2) He gave 3/8 of his money to his mother. To calculate this, we take 3/8 of $200:
3/8 * $200 = $75
So, John gave his mother $75.
3) He then gave 3/10 of his money to his father. To calculate this, we take 3/10 of $200:
3/10 * $200 = $60
So, John gave his father $60.
4) Now, to calculate how much money John had left, we take the original $200 and subtract the $75 he gave to his mother and the $60 he gave to his father:
$200 - $75 - $60 = $65

Answer: $65
