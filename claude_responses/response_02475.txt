Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah bought 12 lollipops for a total of $3
* This means each lollipop costs $3 / 12 = $0.25
* Sarah offered to share one-quarter of the lollipops with her friend Julie
* One-quarter of 12 lollipops is 3 lollipops
* Julie insisted on reimbursing Sarah for the cost of the 3 lollipops she shared
* The cost of 3 lollipops at $0.25 each is 3 * $0.25 = $0.75

Therefore, the amount of money, in cents, that Julie gave Sarah to pay for the shared lollipops is:
Answer: 75 cents
