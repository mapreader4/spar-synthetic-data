Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Louise already has 28 toys worth $10 each in her cart
* The total value of the 28 toys is 28 * $10 = $280
* She then adds 20 teddy bears to the cart
* The total number of toys in the cart is now 28 + 20 = 48
* Louise has $580 in her wallet, which is exactly enough to pay for all the toys
* To find the cost of each teddy bear, we need to subtract the value of the 28 original toys ($280) from the total amount Louise has ($580)
* $580 - $280 = $300
* The remaining $300 must be the cost of the 20 teddy bears
* To find the cost of each teddy bear, we divide $300 by 20
* $300 / 20 = $15

Answer: $15
