Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first throw:
   - Christine throws the ball 20 feet high.
   - Janice's throw is 4 feet lower than Christine's, so Janice throws the ball 16 feet high.

2. On the second throw:
   - Christine throws the ball 10 feet higher than her first throw, so 20 + 10 = 30 feet high.
   - Janice throws the ball twice as high as her first throw, so 16 x 2 = 32 feet high.

3. On the third throw:
   - Christine throws the ball 4 feet higher than her second throw, so 30 + 4 = 34 feet high.
   - Janice throws the ball 17 feet higher than Christine's first throw, so 20 + 17 = 37 feet high.

Therefore, the height of the highest throw is 37 feet.

Answer: 37
