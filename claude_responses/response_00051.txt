Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ann cuts a 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle for the living room. The area of this rectangle is 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet.
2) Ann cuts a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle for the bedroom. The area of this rectangle is 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet.
3) The total area of fabric used is 24 square feet + 8 square feet = 32 square feet.
4) The bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet, so the total area of the bolt is 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet.
5) To find the amount of fabric left, we subtract the amount of fabric used from the total area of the bolt:
192 square feet - 32 square feet = 160 square feet.

Answer: 160 square feet.
