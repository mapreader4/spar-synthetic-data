Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Spencer jumps 4 times per minute
* He jumps for 10 minutes each session
* He does 2 sessions each day
* So in one day, he jumps:
    - 4 jumps per minute x 10 minutes per session x 2 sessions per day = 80 jumps per day
* Now, we need to find the total number of jumps in 5 days:
    - 80 jumps per day x 5 days = 400 jumps

Answer: 400
