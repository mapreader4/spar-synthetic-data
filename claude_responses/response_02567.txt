Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Hank makes $100 in a carwash and donates 90% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter.
   * 90% of $100 = 0.9 * $100 = $90

2. Hank makes $80 in a bake sale and donates 75% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter.
   * 75% of $80 = 0.75 * $80 = $60

3. Hank makes $50 mowing lawns and donates 100% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter.
   * 100% of $50 = 1 * $50 = $50

Now, we add up the total amount Hank donated:
* $90 + $60 + $50 = $200

Answer: $200
