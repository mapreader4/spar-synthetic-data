Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Titan's father transports the onion harvest to their store using Mr. Clay's pickup
* The pickup can carry 10 bags per trip
* Each bag of onions weighs 50 kgs
* The pickup makes 20 trips

To calculate the total weight of onions harvested, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of bags transported
2. Multiply the total number of bags by the weight of each bag

Step 1: Total number of bags transported
* The pickup makes 20 trips
* Each trip carries 10 bags
* Total number of bags = 20 trips x 10 bags/trip = 200 bags

Step 2: Total weight of onions harvested
* Each bag weighs 50 kgs
* Total weight = 200 bags x 50 kgs/bag = 10,000 kgs

Answer: 10,000
