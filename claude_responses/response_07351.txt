Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The elliptical machine costs $120
* Rita made a down payment equal to half the cost of the machine
* To calculate the down payment:
    - Down payment = 1/2 * $120 = $60
* The balance remaining to be paid is the total cost minus the down payment:
    - Balance = $120 - $60 = $60
* The store employee offered to waive all layaway fees and taxes if Rita paid the balance within 10 days
* To find the daily minimum amount Rita must pay, we divide the balance by the number of days:
    - Daily minimum = $60 / 10 days = $6

Answer: $6
