Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that 1 ounce of Dawn liquid soap can make 200,000 bubbles.
2) We also know that Dr. Bronner's liquid soap can make twice as many bubbles per ounce as Dawn liquid soap.
   * This means that 1 ounce of Dr. Bronner's liquid soap can make 400,000 bubbles (2 x 200,000).
3) The question asks how many bubbles can be made from one half ounce of an equal mixture of Dawn and Dr. Bronner's liquid soaps.
   * Since it's an equal mixture, we can assume that the half ounce is made up of 1/4 ounce of Dawn and 1/4 ounce of Dr. Bronner's.
4) From the 1/4 ounce of Dawn, we can make 50,000 bubbles (1/4 x 200,000).
5) From the 1/4 ounce of Dr. Bronner's, we can make 100,000 bubbles (1/4 x 400,000).
6) Adding the bubbles from the Dawn and Dr. Bronner's, we get a total of 150,000 bubbles.

Answer: 150,000
