Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total cost of the field trip to Washington DC is $485.
2) Zoe's grandma gave her $250 towards the fees.
3) Zoe needs to earn the remaining amount, which is $485 - $250 = $235.
4) Zoe makes $1.25 for every candy bar she sells.
5) To find how many candy bars Zoe needs to sell, we divide the remaining amount ($235) by the amount she makes per candy bar ($1.25).
6) $235 / $1.25 = 188 candy bars.

Answer: 188
