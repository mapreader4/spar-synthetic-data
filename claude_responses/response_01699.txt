Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 105 flowers in total in the garden.
2) There are twice as many red flowers as orange flowers. If there are 10 orange flowers, then there are 20 red flowers.
3) There are 5 fewer yellow flowers than red flowers. So, there are 15 yellow flowers.
4) The remaining flowers must be pink and purple, and they have the same amount.
5) We know the total number of flowers is 105, and we have accounted for 20 red, 10 orange, and 15 yellow flowers. That leaves 105 - 20 - 10 - 15 = 60 flowers that must be pink and purple.
6) Since the pink and purple flowers have the same amount, we can divide 60 by 2 to get the number of each color. 
Answer: 30 pink flowers and 30 purple flowers.
