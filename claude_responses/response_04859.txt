Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Lloyd has 16 decks of cards, and each deck has 52 cards.
2) So the total number of cards Lloyd has is 16 * 52 = 832 cards.
3) The house of cards is 32 layers tall.
4) Since each layer has the same number of cards, we can divide the total number of cards by the number of layers to find the number of cards per layer.
5) 832 cards / 32 layers = 26 cards per layer.

Answer: 26
