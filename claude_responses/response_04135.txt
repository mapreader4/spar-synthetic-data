Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 adults, each with 32 teeth
* The first person had 1/4 of their teeth removed
* The second person had 3/8 of their teeth removed
* The third person had 1/2 of their teeth removed
* The fourth person had 4 teeth removed

First, let's calculate the number of teeth removed for each person:
* Person 1: 1/4 of 32 teeth = 8 teeth removed
* Person 2: 3/8 of 32 teeth = 12 teeth removed
* Person 3: 1/2 of 32 teeth = 16 teeth removed
* Person 4: 4 teeth removed

Now, we can add up the total number of teeth removed:
* 8 + 12 + 16 + 4 = 40 teeth removed

Answer: 40
