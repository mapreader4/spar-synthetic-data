Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nadia needs to buy 20 roses
2) She also needs to buy 3/4 times as many lilies as roses
3) The number of lilies she needs to buy is 3/4 * 20 = 15 lilies
4) Roses cost $5 each, so the total cost of the roses is 20 * $5 = $100
5) Lilies cost twice as much as roses, so each lily costs $10
6) The total cost of the lilies is 15 * $10 = $150
7) The total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is the sum of the cost of the roses and the cost of the lilies, which is $100 + $150 = $250.

Answer: 250
