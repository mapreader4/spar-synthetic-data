Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Zachary wants to buy a football, a pair of shorts, and a pair of football shoes.
2) The football costs $3.75, the shorts cost $2.40, and the shoes cost $11.85.
3) To calculate the total cost, we add up the individual costs:
   $3.75 + $2.40 + $11.85 = $18.00
4) Zachary has $10.
5) To find out how much more money Zachary needs, we subtract the amount he has ($10) from the total cost ($18.00):
   $18.00 - $10.00 = $8.00

Answer: $8
