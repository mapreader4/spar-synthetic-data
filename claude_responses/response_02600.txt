Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emir wants to buy:
   - A dictionary that costs $5
   - A dinosaur book that costs $11
   - A children's cookbook that costs $5
2) The total cost of the three books is:
   - $5 + $11 + $5 = $21
3) Emir has saved $19 from his allowance.
4) To calculate how much more money Emir needs, we take the total cost of the books ($21) and subtract the amount he has saved ($19):
   - $21 - $19 = $2
