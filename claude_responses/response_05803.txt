Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Daniel buys a magazine costing $0.85 and a pencil costing $0.50.
2) The total cost of the items he bought is $0.85 + $0.50 = $1.35.
3) He has a coupon that gives him $0.35 off.
4) To calculate the final amount he spends, we take the total cost of the items ($1.35) and subtract the coupon discount ($0.35).
5) $1.35 - $0.35 = $1.00.

Answer: $1.00
