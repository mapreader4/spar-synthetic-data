Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Caleb can add 7 gallons per trip, and Cynthia can add 8 gallons per trip.
2) It will take 105 gallons to fill the pool.
3) To find the total number of trips, we need to find how many gallons they can add per trip, and then divide the total gallons needed by that amount.
4) The total gallons added per trip is 7 + 8 = 15 gallons.
5) To find the number of trips, we divide the total gallons needed (105) by the gallons added per trip (15):
105 gallons / 15 gallons per trip = 7 trips.

Answer: 7
