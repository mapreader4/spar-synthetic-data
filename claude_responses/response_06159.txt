Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The restaurant sold 10 meals at $8 each. So, the total revenue from those 10 meals is:
10 meals x $8 per meal = $80

2) The restaurant sold 5 meals at $10 each. So, the total revenue from those 5 meals is:
5 meals x $10 per meal = $50

3) The restaurant sold 20 meals at $4 each. So, the total revenue from those 20 meals is:
20 meals x $4 per meal = $80

4) To calculate the total revenue for the day, we add up the revenue from each set of meals:
$80 + $50 + $80 = $210

Answer: $210
