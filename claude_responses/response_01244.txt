Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The singer is planning on releasing 3 songs in a month
* He worked on one song for 10 hours a day
* Each song took 10 days to be completed

To find the total number of hours he took to complete the 3 songs, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of hours per song:
   * 10 hours per day x 10 days = 100 hours per song
2. Calculate the total number of hours for all 3 songs:
   * 100 hours per song x 3 songs = 300 hours

Answer: 300
