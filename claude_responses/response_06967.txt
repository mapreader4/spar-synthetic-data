Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Anika has 4 more than twice the number of pencils as Reeta.
2) Reeta has 20 pencils.
3) To find the number of pencils Anika has, we first need to find twice the number of pencils Reeta has.
4) Twice the number of pencils Reeta has is 2 * 20 = 40.
5) Anika has 4 more than twice the number of pencils as Reeta, so Anika has 40 + 4 = 44 pencils.
6) The total number of pencils the two have together is Reeta's 20 pencils plus Anika's 44 pencils, which is 20 + 44 = 64 pencils.

Answer: 64
