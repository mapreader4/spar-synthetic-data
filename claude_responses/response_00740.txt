Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly.
2) Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry.
3) Barry bought 12 pretzels.
4) Since Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry, and Barry bought 12 pretzels, Shelly must have bought 6 pretzels (12 / 2 = 6).
5) Since Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly, and Shelly bought 6 pretzels, Angie must have bought 18 pretzels (6 x 3 = 18).

Answer: 18
