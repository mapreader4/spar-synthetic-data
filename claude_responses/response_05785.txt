Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 35 books on the cart in total
* 5 of those books are fiction books
* There are 4 more non-fiction books than fiction books, so there are 5 + 4 = 9 non-fiction books
* There are 2 times as many autobiographies as fiction books, so there are 2 * 5 = 10 autobiographies
* The remaining books must be picture books

To find the number of picture books, we need to subtract the number of fiction, non-fiction, and autobiography books from the total number of books:
* Total books = 35
* Fiction books = 5
* Non-fiction books = 9
* Autobiography books = 10
* Picture books = 35 - 5 - 9 - 10 = 11
