Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tonya has 13 stamps
2) Jimmy has 5 matchbooks
3) Each matchbook contains 24 matches
4) Tonya and Jimmy have decided that 1 stamp is worth 12 matches
5) Jimmy trades all his matchbooks for stamps
6) To calculate how many stamps Jimmy gets in exchange for his 5 matchbooks:
   * Each matchbook has 24 matches
   * So 5 matchbooks have 5 * 24 = 120 matches
   * Since 1 stamp is worth 12 matches, Jimmy gets 120 / 12 = 10 stamps
7) Now Tonya has her original 13 stamps, plus the 10 stamps she got from Jimmy, so she has 13 + 10 = 23 stamps.

Answer: 23
