Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenna plans to drive the first 200 miles. At 50 miles per hour, this will take her 200 / 50 = 4 hours.
2) Jenna's friend will drive the last 100 miles. At 20 miles per hour, this will take her 100 / 20 = 5 hours.
3) They plan on taking 2 30-minute breaks, which is a total of 1 hour of break time.
4) The total time spent on the road trip is the time Jenna drives (4 hours) plus the time her friend drives (5 hours) plus the break time (1 hour).
5) Therefore, the total time spent on the road trip is 4 + 5 + 1 = 10 hours.
