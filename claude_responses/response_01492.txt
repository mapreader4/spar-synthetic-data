Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ellie has 8 pairs of shoes
* Riley has 3 fewer pairs of shoes than Ellie
* To find the number of pairs of shoes Riley has, we subtract 3 from Ellie's 8 pairs
* 8 pairs - 3 pairs = 5 pairs
* Now, to find the total number of pairs of shoes they have, we add Ellie's 8 pairs and Riley's 5 pairs
* 8 pairs + 5 pairs = 13 pairs

Answer: 13
