Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marcus started with 18 pebbles.
2) He skipped half of them across the lake. Half of 18 is 9, so he skipped 9 pebbles.
3) That means he had 18 - 9 = 9 pebbles left.
4) Freddy then gave him 30 more pebbles.
5) So the total number of pebbles Marcus has now is 9 + 30 = 39 pebbles.

Answer: 39
