Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barry needs to take vitamin D3 for 180 days
* The daily serving size is 2 capsules
* Each bottle of vitamin D3 contains 60 capsules

To calculate the total number of capsules Barry needs for 180 days, we multiply the daily serving size by the number of days:
* 2 capsules per day x 180 days = 360 capsules

Now, to determine how many bottles Barry needs to buy, we divide the total number of capsules needed by the number of capsules per bottle:
* 360 capsules / 60 capsules per bottle = 6 bottles

Therefore, Barry would need to buy 6 bottles of vitamin D3 to have enough servings to last for 180 days.
