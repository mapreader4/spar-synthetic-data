Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There are 55 people at the track meet.
2) 30 of them are boys, so the remaining 25 must be girls.
3) Three-fifths of the girls have long hair, which means two-fifths of the girls have short hair.
4) To find the number of girls with short hair, we take two-fifths of the 25 girls:
2/5 * 25 = 10
Answer: 10
