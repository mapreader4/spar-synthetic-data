Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cara has 60 marbles in the bag
* 20 of them are yellow
* Half as many are green, which means 10 are green
* The remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue
* To find the number of red and blue marbles, we take the total (60) and subtract the yellow (20) and green (10) marbles:
    - 60 - 20 - 10 = 30 remaining marbles
* Since the remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue, there are 15 red marbles and 15 blue marbles
* To find the odds of picking a blue marble, we divide the number of blue marbles by the total number of marbles:
    - 15 / 60 = 0.25
* To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
    - 0.25 * 100 = 25%

Answer: 25%
