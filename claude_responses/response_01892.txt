Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) Tamika drove for 8 hours at an average speed of 45 miles per hour.
   * To find the total distance Tamika drove, we multiply the time (8 hours) by the speed (45 miles per hour):
   * 8 hours x 45 miles per hour = 360 miles

2) Logan drove for 5 hours at 55 miles per hour.
   * To find the total distance Logan drove, we multiply the time (5 hours) by the speed (55 miles per hour):
   * 5 hours x 55 miles per hour = 275 miles

3) To find the difference in distance between Tamika and Logan, we subtract Logan's distance from Tamika's distance:
   * 360 miles - 275 miles = 85 miles

Answer: 85 miles
