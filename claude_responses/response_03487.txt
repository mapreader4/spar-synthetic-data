Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Johnny makes his crab dish 40 times a day
* Each dish uses 1.5 pounds of crab meat
* Crab meat sells for $8 per pound
* He is closed 3 days a week

First, let's calculate how much crab meat he uses in a day:
* 40 dishes x 1.5 pounds per dish = 60 pounds of crab meat per day

Now, let's calculate how much he spends on crab meat in a day:
* 60 pounds of crab meat x $8 per pound = $480 per day

Finally, let's calculate how much he spends in a week:
* 4 days per week (assuming he's open 4 days) x $480 per day = $1,920 per week

Answer: $1,920
