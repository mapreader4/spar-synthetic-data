Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cory has $20.00 to start with.
2) She wants to buy two packs of candies that cost $49.00 each.
3) To calculate the total cost of the two packs of candies, we multiply the cost of one pack ($49.00) by 2:
$49.00 x 2 = $98.00
4) To calculate how much more money Cory needs, we subtract the amount she has ($20.00) from the total cost ($98.00):
$98.00 - $20.00 = $78.00
Answer: $78
