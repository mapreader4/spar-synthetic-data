Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Henry is paid $8 more to sell a bike than he is paid to paint the bike
* Henry is paid $5 to paint the bike
* So, Henry is paid $5 + $8 = $13 to sell a bike
* Henry is selling 8 bikes
* To calculate the total amount Henry gets paid to sell and paint 8 bikes, we need to add the amount he gets paid to sell the bikes and the amount he gets paid to paint the bikes.
* The amount he gets paid to sell the 8 bikes is 8 * $13 = $104
* The amount he gets paid to paint the 8 bikes is 8 * $5 = $40
* Therefore, the total amount Henry gets paid to sell and paint 8 bikes is $104 + $40 = $144

Answer: 144
