Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The US flag has 50 stars, one for each state
* The US flag has 13 stripes, representing the original 13 colonies
* Pete's flag uses circles to represent the number of scoops of ice cream he can consume in one sitting
* The number of circles on Pete's flag is 3 less than half the number of stars on the US flag
* The number of stars on the US flag is 50
* Half of 50 is 25
* 25 - 3 = 22 circles on Pete's flag
* Pete's flag also uses squares to represent the number of brownies he has hidden beneath his bed
* The number of squares is six more than twice the number of stripes on the US flag
* The number of stripes on the US flag is 13
* Twice the number of stripes is 26
* 26 + 6 = 32 squares on Pete's flag

Answer: 22 + 32 = 54
