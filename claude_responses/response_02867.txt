Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Micah runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. This means that if Dean takes 9 hours, Micah will take 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours to complete the marathon.
2) Jake takes 1/3 times more time to finish the marathon than Micah. This means that if Micah takes 6 hours, Jake will take 6 + (1/3 * 6) = 6 + 2 = 8 hours to complete the marathon.
3) To find the total time the three take to complete the marathon, we add up the individual times:
Micah: 6 hours
Dean: 9 hours
Jake: 8 hours
Total time: 6 + 9 + 8 = 23 hours

Answer: 23
