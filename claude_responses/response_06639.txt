Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maria bought a pen and a pencil
* The pen cost half the price of the pencil
* The pencil cost $8

To find the cost of the pen, we can use the information that the pen cost half the price of the pencil:
* Cost of pen = 1/2 * Cost of pencil
* Cost of pen = 1/2 * $8 = $4

Now we can find the total cost of both the pen and the pencil:
* Total cost = Cost of pen + Cost of pencil
* Total cost = $4 + $8 = $12

Answer: $12
