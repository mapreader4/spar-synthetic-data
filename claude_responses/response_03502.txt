Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Spike hunts 5 crickets every morning
* He hunts three times that amount over the afternoon and evening
* To calculate the afternoon and evening amount:
    - 3 times the morning amount is 3 x 5 = 15 crickets
* To calculate the total number of crickets hunted per day:
    - Morning: 5 crickets
    - Afternoon/Evening: 15 crickets
    - Total: 5 + 15 = 20 crickets

Answer: 20 crickets
