Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The building has a total of 300 units
* Half of the units are residential, so that's 150 residential units
* The other half of the units are split evenly between offices and restaurants
* Since the other half is split evenly, that means there are 75 office units and 75 restaurant units
* Therefore, the number of restaurants in the building is 75.

Answer: 75
