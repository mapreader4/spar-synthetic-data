Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there are 14 caterpillars on the tree.
* 4 more eggs hatch, and the baby caterpillars climb out to munch on the leaves.
* So, the total number of caterpillars on the tree is now 14 + 4 = 18.
* 8 fat caterpillars leave the tree to cocoon themselves to be butterflies.
* So, the number of caterpillars left on the tree is 18 - 8 = 10.
