Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ali had 800 books in his Room initially
* On Monday, he sold 60 books
* On Tuesday, he sold 10 books
* On Wednesday, he sold 20 books
* On Thursday, he sold 44 books
* On Friday, he sold 66 books
* To calculate the number of books not sold, we need to subtract the total number of books sold from the initial stock of 800 books

Total books sold:
* Monday: 60 books
* Tuesday: 10 books
* Wednesday: 20 books
* Thursday: 44 books
* Friday: 66 books
* Total books sold = 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = 200 books

Now, we can calculate the number of books not sold:
* Initial stock: 800 books
* Total books sold: 200 books
* Books not sold = 800 - 200 = 600 books

Answer: 600
