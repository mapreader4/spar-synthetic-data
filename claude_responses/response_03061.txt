Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first month, Mikaela tutored for 35 hours.
2. In the second month, she tutored 5 hours more than the first month, which is 35 + 5 = 40 hours.
3. So, the total number of hours she tutored is 35 + 40 = 75 hours.
4. She earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 75 hours x $10 per hour = $750.
5. She spent 4/5 of her total earnings on her personal needs, which is 4/5 x $750 = $600.
6. The remaining 1/5 of her earnings is what she saved, which is 1/5 x $750 = $150.

Answer: $150
