Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 81 students in the classroom.
2) Two-thirds of the students are wearing striped shirts, and the remaining one-third are wearing checkered shirts.
   * Two-thirds of 81 = 2/3 * 81 = 54 students wearing striped shirts.
   * One-third of 81 = 1/3 * 81 = 27 students wearing checkered shirts.
3) There are 19 more students wearing shorts than checkered shirts.
   * 27 students wearing checkered shirts + 19 more = 46 students wearing shorts.
4) To find the difference between the number of students wearing striped shirts and the number of students wearing shorts, we subtract the number of students wearing shorts from the number of students wearing striped shirts.
   * 54 students wearing striped shirts - 46 students wearing shorts = 8 more students wearing striped shirts than shorts.
