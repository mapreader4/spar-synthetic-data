Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 types of CDs: rock and roll, pop, dance, and country
* The prices of each type of CD are:
  - Rock and roll: $5 each
  - Pop: $10 each
  - Dance: $3 each
  - Country: $7 each
* Julia wants to buy 4 of each type of CD
* So the total number of CDs she wants to buy is 4 x 4 = 16 CDs
* The total cost of the CDs would be:
  - 4 rock and roll CDs at $5 each = $20
  - 4 pop CDs at $10 each = $40
  - 4 dance CDs at $3 each = $12
  - 4 country CDs at $7 each = $28
* The total cost of all 16 CDs is $20 + $40 + $12 + $28 = $100
* Julia only has $75 to spend
* Therefore, the amount of money she is short is $100 - $75 = $25

Answer: $25
