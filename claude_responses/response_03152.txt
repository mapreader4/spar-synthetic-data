Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kiki made 10 cucumber sandwiches, and each one was cut into 4 triangles
* So the total number of cucumber sandwich triangles is 10 x 4 = 40 triangles
* Kiki also made 8 egg sandwiches, and each one was cut into 2 rectangles
* So the total number of egg sandwich rectangles is 8 x 2 = 16 rectangles
* The guests ate 28 triangles and 12 rectangles
* To find the total number of slices of bread eaten, we need to add the number of triangles and rectangles
* 28 triangles + 12 rectangles = 40 slices of bread

Answer: 40
