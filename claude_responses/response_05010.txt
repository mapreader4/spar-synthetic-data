Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackson wants to save $3,000.00 for his vacation
* The vacation is 15 months away
* He gets paid 2 times a month

To calculate the amount he needs to save per paycheck, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of paychecks he will receive in the 15 months
   * 15 months x 2 paychecks per month = 30 paychecks
2. Divide the total amount he wants to save ($3,000.00) by the total number of paychecks (30)
   * $3,000.00 / 30 = $100.00 per paycheck

Therefore, to have enough money saved for his vacation, Jackson needs to set aside $100.00 per paycheck.
