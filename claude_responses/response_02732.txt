Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The baker bakes 5 loaves of bread per hour in one oven
* The baker has 4 ovens
* So in one hour, the baker can bake 5 loaves x 4 ovens = 20 loaves of bread
* From Monday to Friday, the baker bakes for 5 hours per day
* So in a weekday, the baker can bake 20 loaves/hour x 5 hours = 100 loaves of bread
* On Saturday and Sunday, the baker bakes for 2 hours per day
* So on a weekend day, the baker can bake 20 loaves/hour x 2 hours = 40 loaves of bread
* In one week, the baker bakes:
  - 5 weekdays x 100 loaves/day = 500 loaves
  - 2 weekend days x 40 loaves/day = 80 loaves
  - Total for one week = 500 + 80 = 580 loaves
* In 3 weeks, the baker bakes:
  - 3 weeks x 580 loaves/week = 1,740 loaves

Answer: 1,740 loaves of bread
