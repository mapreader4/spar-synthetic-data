Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Each person eats 1.5 pounds of potatoes.
2) James makes potatoes for 40 people.
3) Therefore, the total amount of potatoes needed is:
   40 people x 1.5 pounds per person = 60 pounds of potatoes.
4) A 20-pound bag of potatoes costs $5.
5) To calculate the total cost, we need to determine how many 20-pound bags of potatoes are needed.
6) 60 pounds of potatoes / 20 pounds per bag = 3 bags.
7) 3 bags x $5 per bag = $15.

Answer: $15.
