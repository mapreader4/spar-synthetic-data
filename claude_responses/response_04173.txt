Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack uses 3 cups of ketchup, 1 cup of vinegar, and 1 cup of honey to make the barbecue sauce
* Each burger takes 1/4 cup of sauce
* Each pulled pork sandwich takes 1/6 cup of sauce
* Jack makes 18 pulled pork sandwiches

First, let's calculate the total amount of sauce Jack can make:
* Total sauce = 3 cups ketchup + 1 cup vinegar + 1 cup honey = 5 cups

Now, let's calculate how much sauce is used for the 18 pulled pork sandwiches:
* Sauce used for pulled pork = 18 sandwiches x 1/6 cup per sandwich = 3 cups

The remaining sauce can be used for burgers:
* Remaining sauce = 5 cups - 3 cups = 2 cups

Finally, we can calculate how many burgers Jack can make with the remaining 2 cups of sauce:
* Burgers = 2 cups / 1/4 cup per burger = 8 burgers

Answer: 8 burgers
