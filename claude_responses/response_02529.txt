Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first competitor can eat 10 hot dogs per minute
* The second competitor can eat 3 times more than the first competitor, which means they can eat 3 x 10 = 30 hot dogs per minute
* The third competitor can eat twice as much as the second competitor, which means they can eat 2 x 30 = 60 hot dogs per minute
* The question asks how many hot dogs the third competitor can eat after 5 minutes
* To calculate this, we take the third competitor's rate of 60 hot dogs per minute and multiply it by 5 minutes
* 60 hot dogs per minute x 5 minutes = 300 hot dogs

Answer: 300
