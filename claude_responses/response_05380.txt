Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Hugh had 8 pounds of candy
* Tommy had 6 pounds of candy
* Melany had 7 pounds of candy
* The total amount of candy is 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 pounds
* If they share the candy equally, each person will have the same amount
* To find the amount each person will have, we divide the total amount of candy (21 pounds) by the number of people (3)
* 21 pounds / 3 people = 7 pounds per person
