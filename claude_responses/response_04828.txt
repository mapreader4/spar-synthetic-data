Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John had $20 to start with.
2) He spent 1/5 of his money on snacks. 1/5 of $20 is $4, so he spent $4 on snacks.
3) That leaves him with $20 - $4 = $16 remaining.
4) He then spent 3/4 of the remaining $16 on necessities. 3/4 of $16 is $12, so he spent $12 on necessities.
5) That leaves him with $16 - $12 = $4 remaining.

Answer: $4
