Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Elyse had 100 pieces of gum.
2) She gave half of her gum to her brother Rick. That means Rick received 50 pieces of gum.
3) Rick then gave half of his 50 pieces to his friend Shane. That means Shane received 25 pieces of gum.
4) Shane then chewed 11 pieces of gum.
5) To find how many pieces Shane has left, we take the 25 pieces he received and subtract the 11 pieces he chewed.

Answer: 14
