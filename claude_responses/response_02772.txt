Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shyne can grow 14 eggplants in every seed packet
* She bought 4 seed packets of eggplants
* So, the total number of eggplants she can grow is:
    * 14 eggplants per packet x 4 packets = 56 eggplants

* Shyne can grow 10 sunflowers in every seed packet
* She bought 6 seed packets of sunflowers
* So, the total number of sunflowers she can grow is:
    * 10 sunflowers per packet x 6 packets = 60 sunflowers

* To find the total number of plants Shyne can grow, we add the eggplants and sunflowers:
    * 56 eggplants + 60 sunflowers = 116 plants

Answer: 116
