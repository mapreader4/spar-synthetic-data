Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Susan bought 5 dozen peaches
* 1 dozen = 12 peaches
* So, the total number of peaches Susan bought is 5 * 12 = 60 peaches
* She brought two identically-sized cloth bags and a smaller knapsack
* She placed half as many peaches in the knapsack as she placed in each of the two cloth bags
* Let's call the number of peaches in each cloth bag 'x'
* Since there are two cloth bags, the total number of peaches in the cloth bags is 2x
* The remaining peaches (60 - 2x) were placed in the knapsack
* We know that the number of peaches in the knapsack is half of 'x', so it is x/2
* Therefore, the number of peaches in the knapsack is: x/2
