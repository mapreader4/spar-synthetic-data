Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah started with 25 apples in her bag
* At school, she gave one apple to each teacher she saw
* She also gave one apple to each of 5 of her closest friends
* And she ate one apple while walking home
* When she got home, she had 3 apples left in the bag

First, let's calculate the number of apples she gave away:
* She gave one apple to each teacher she saw
* She also gave one apple to each of 5 of her closest friends
* So the total number of apples she gave away is the number of teachers she saw, plus 5

Now, let's calculate the number of apples she had left when she got home:
* She started with 25 apples
* She ate 1 apple while walking home
* She had 3 apples left when she got home
* So the total number of apples she had left is 25 - 1 - 3 = 21

Therefore, the number of apples she gave away to teachers is:
* Total apples given away = 21 (total apples left) + 1 (apple eaten) + 3 (apples left at home) = 25
* Number of apples given to teachers = 25 - 5 (given to friends) = 20

Answer: 20
