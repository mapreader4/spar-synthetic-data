Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Enrique has 2,132 contracts that need to be shredded
* His paper shredder can only shred 6 pages at a time
* To find the number of times he needs to shred 6 units of paper until all the contracts are shredded, we need to divide the total number of contracts by the number of contracts shredded per cycle

First, we calculate the total number of pages that need to be shredded:
* 2,132 contracts x 1 page per contract = 2,132 pages

Next, we calculate how many cycles of 6 pages each are needed to shred all 2,132 pages:
* 2,132 pages / 6 pages per cycle = 355.33 cycles

Since we can't have a fractional number of cycles, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:
* 355.33 cycles rounds up to 356 cycles

Therefore, Enrique will need to shred 6 units of paper 356 times until all of the contracts are shredded.

Answer: 356
