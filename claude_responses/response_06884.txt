Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janet has 24 dresses total
* Half of the dresses have pockets, which means 12 dresses have pockets
* Of the 12 dresses with pockets, a third have 2 pockets and the rest have 3 pockets
* To find the number of dresses with 2 pockets, we take a third of 12, which is 4 dresses
* The remaining 8 dresses have 3 pockets each
* So the total number of pockets is:
  - 4 dresses with 2 pockets each, which is 4 x 2 = 8 pockets
  - 8 dresses with 3 pockets each, which is 8 x 3 = 24 pockets
* Adding these together, the total number of pockets is 8 + 24 = 32 pockets

Answer: 32
