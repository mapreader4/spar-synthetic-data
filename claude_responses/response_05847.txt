Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ursula earns $8.50 per hour.
2) She works 8 hours per day.
3) She works 20 days per month.
4) To calculate her monthly salary, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she works per day, and then multiply that by the number of days she works per month:
$8.50 per hour x 8 hours per day x 20 days per month = $1,360 per month.
5) To calculate her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 months:
$1,360 per month x 12 months = $16,320 per year.

Answer: $16,320
