Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The box contains 10 purple candies
* The box contains 4 more yellow candies than purple candies
* So, the number of yellow candies is 10 + 4 = 14
* The box contains 2 fewer green candies than yellow candies
* So, the number of green candies is 14 - 2 = 12
* To find the total number of rainbow nerds in the box, we add up the number of purple, yellow, and green candies:
* 10 purple + 14 yellow + 12 green = 36 total rainbow nerds

Answer: 36
