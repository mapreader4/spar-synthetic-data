Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wolfgang bought 16 marbles.
2) Ludo bought 1/4 times more marbles than Wolfgang. That means Ludo bought 16 + (16 * 1/4) = 16 + 4 = 20 marbles.
3) Michael bought 2/3 times as many marbles as the number of marbles both Wolfgang and Ludo bought. The total number of marbles bought by Wolfgang and Ludo is 16 + 20 = 36. So Michael bought 36 * 2/3 = 24 marbles.
4) The total number of marbles bought by the three friends is 16 + 20 + 24 = 60 marbles.
5) If they decided to share the marbles equally, each of them would get 60 / 3 = 20 marbles.

Answer: 20
