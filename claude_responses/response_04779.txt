Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Melony makes $21 of profit every time she sells 3 shirts
* This means she makes $7 of profit per shirt (since $21 / 3 = $7)
* Melony makes four times as much profit when she sells two pairs of sandals
* This means she makes $84 of profit per two pairs of sandals (since $21 x 4 = $84)
* She is selling 7 shirts, so her profit from the shirts will be:
  * 7 shirts x $7 per shirt = $49
* She is selling 3 pairs of sandals, so her profit from the sandals will be:
  * 3 pairs / 2 pairs per sale = 1.5 sales
  * 1.5 sales x $84 per sale = $126
* To calculate the total profit, we add the profits from the shirts and sandals:
  * $49 + $126 = $175

Answer: 175
