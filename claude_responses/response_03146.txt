Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) George can carry 2 buckets per round, and Harry can carry 3 buckets per round.
2) It takes a total of 110 buckets to fill the pool.
3) We need to find the minimum number of rounds it will take to fill the pool.
4) In each round, George and Harry can carry a total of 2 + 3 = 5 buckets.
5) The number of rounds needed to fill the pool is the total number of buckets (110) divided by the number of buckets carried per round (5).
6) 110 / 5 = 22 rounds.

Answer: 22
