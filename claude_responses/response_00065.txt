Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lee charges $33 per lawn mowed.
2) Last week, Lee mowed 16 lawns.
3) So for the 16 lawns mowed, Lee earned:
   16 lawns x $33 per lawn = $528
4) Additionally, three customers each gave him a $10 tip.
5) So the total tip amount is:
   3 customers x $10 per tip = $30
6) To calculate the total amount Lee earned last week, we add the amount earned from mowing the lawns and the tip amount:
   $528 + $30 = $558

Answer: 558
