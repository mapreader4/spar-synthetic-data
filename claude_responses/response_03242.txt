Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jane purchased 15 ice cream cones, and each ice cream cone cost $5.
2) To calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones, we multiply the number of cones (15) by the cost per cone ($5):
15 ice cream cones x $5 per cone = $75 total for ice cream cones.
3) Jane also purchased 5 cups of pudding, and each cup of pudding cost $2.
4) To calculate the total cost of the pudding, we multiply the number of cups (5) by the cost per cup ($2):
5 cups of pudding x $2 per cup = $10 total for the pudding.
5) To find the difference between what Jane spent on ice cream and what she spent on pudding, we subtract the total cost of the pudding ($10) from the total cost of the ice cream ($75):
$75 - $10 = $65.

Answer: $65
