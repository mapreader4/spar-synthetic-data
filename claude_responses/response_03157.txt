Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chris's internet bill is $45 per month for 100 GB
* He is charged $0.25 for every 1 GB over the 100 GB limit
* His bill for this month is $65

To find out how many GB over the limit he was charged for, we can use the following equation:
* Total bill = Base cost + Overage cost
* $65 = $45 + $0.25 * (Overage GB)
* $20 = $0.25 * (Overage GB)
* Overage GB = $20 / $0.25
* Overage GB = 80 GB

Answer: 80 GB
