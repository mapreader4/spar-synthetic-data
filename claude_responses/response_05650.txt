Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dustin can read 75 pages in an hour.
2) Sam can read 24 pages in an hour.
3) We want to know how many more pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes compared to Sam.
4) To find this, we need to calculate how many pages each of them can read in 40 minutes.
5) Dustin can read 75 pages in an hour, so in 40 minutes he can read 75 * (40/60) = 50 pages.
6) Sam can read 24 pages in an hour, so in 40 minutes he can read 24 * (40/60) = 16 pages.
7) The difference between the number of pages Dustin reads and the number of pages Sam reads in 40 minutes is 50 - 16 = 34 pages.

Answer: 34
