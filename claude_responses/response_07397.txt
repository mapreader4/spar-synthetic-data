Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ryan is looking to fund a $1,000 business
* He already has $200 from his own funds
* The average person funds $10 to a project they're interested in
* We need to find out how many people Ryan will have to recruit to fund the remaining $800

To calculate the number of people Ryan needs to recruit, we can divide the remaining amount ($800) by the average funding per person ($10):

$800 / $10 = 80 people

Therefore, Ryan will need to recruit 80 people to fund the remaining $800 for his $1,000 business.

Answer: 80
