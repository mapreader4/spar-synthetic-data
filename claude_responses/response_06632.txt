Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The team has 11 players
* 5 of the players didn't receive any yellow cards
* The remaining 6 players each received 1 yellow card
* Each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards

To find the number of red cards the whole team would collect, we need to first find the total number of yellow cards received by the team.

The total number of yellow cards received by the team is:
* 6 players x 1 yellow card each = 6 yellow cards

Now, we know that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards, so we can divide the total number of yellow cards by 2 to find the number of red cards.

The number of red cards the whole team would collect is:
* 6 yellow cards / 2 = 3 red cards
