Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 12 coworkers
* They order 3 pizzas
* Each pizza is cut into 8 slices
* Each person should get the same number of slices

First, we need to calculate the total number of slices:
* 3 pizzas x 8 slices per pizza = 24 total slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people to determine how many slices each person will get:
* 24 total slices / 12 people = 2 slices per person

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 2
