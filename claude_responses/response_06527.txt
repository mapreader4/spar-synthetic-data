Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cathy had $12 left in her wallet initially.
2) Her dad sent her $25 for her weekly consumption.
3) Her mom sent her twice the amount her dad sent her, which is 2 * $25 = $50.
4) To calculate the total amount of money Cathy has now, we add the initial $12, the $25 from her dad, and the $50 from her mom:
$12 + $25 + $50 = $87.

Answer: 87
