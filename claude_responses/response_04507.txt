Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John takes 3 naps a week
* Each nap is 2 hours long
* We want to know the total number of hours of naps in 70 days

First, let's calculate the number of hours of naps per week:
* 3 naps per week x 2 hours per nap = 6 hours of naps per week

Now, let's calculate the number of weeks in 70 days:
* 70 days / 7 days per week = 10 weeks

Finally, we can calculate the total number of hours of naps in 70 days:
* 6 hours of naps per week x 10 weeks = 60 hours of naps

Answer: 60
