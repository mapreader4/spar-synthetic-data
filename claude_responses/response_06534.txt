Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ral is twice as old as Suri. This means that Ral's current age is 2 times Suri's current age.
2) In 3 years, Suri's age will be 16. This means that Suri's current age is 16 - 3 = 13.
3) Since Ral is twice as old as Suri, Ral's current age is 2 * 13 = 26.

Answer: 26
