Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Randy started with $30.
2) He spent $10 on his lunch, so he had $30 - $10 = $20 left.
3) He spent a quarter of the $20 he had left on an ice cream cone. A quarter of $20 is $5.
4) So, he spent $5 on the ice cream cone, leaving him with $20 - $5 = $15.
Answer: $15
