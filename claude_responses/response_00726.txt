Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that Jed is 10 years older than Matt.
2) We are also given that in 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old.
3) So, Jed's current age is 25 - 10 = 15 years old.
4) Since Jed is 10 years older than Matt, Matt's current age is 15 - 10 = 5 years old.
5) The sum of their present ages is Jed's age (15) plus Matt's age (5).
