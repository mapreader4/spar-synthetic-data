Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Last year, Ella spent 40% of her income on video games, and that amount was $100.
2) To find her total income last year, we can divide $100 by 0.4 (40% expressed as a decimal):
$100 / 0.4 = $250
3) This year, Ella received a 10% raise. To calculate her new salary, we can take her previous salary of $250 and increase it by 10%:
$250 * 1.10 = $275
Answer: $275
