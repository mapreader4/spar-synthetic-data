Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ruth goes to school 8 hours a day
* She goes to school 5 days a week
* So, the total number of hours she spends in school per week is:
   - 8 hours per day x 5 days per week = 40 hours per week
* She is in math class 25% of this time
* To calculate the number of hours per week she spends in math class, we take 25% of the total hours per week:
   - 40 hours per week x 0.25 = 10 hours per week

Answer: 10 hours
