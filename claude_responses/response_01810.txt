Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Heisenberg earns $80 from 100 mg amoxicillin and $60 from 500 mg amoxicillin every week.
* Each capsule of 100 mg amoxicillin costs $5, and each capsule of 500 mg amoxicillin costs $2.
* To find the total number of capsules sold every 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of capsules sold for each type of amoxicillin, and then add them together.

For the 100 mg amoxicillin:
* Heisenberg earns $80 per week from 100 mg amoxicillin.
* Each capsule costs $5, so the number of capsules sold per week is $80 / $5 = 16 capsules.
* Over 2 weeks, the number of 100 mg amoxicillin capsules sold is 16 x 2 = 32 capsules.

For the 500 mg amoxicillin:
* Heisenberg earns $60 per week from 500 mg amoxicillin.
* Each capsule costs $2, so the number of capsules sold per week is $60 / $2 = 30 capsules.
* Over 2 weeks, the number of 500 mg amoxicillin capsules sold is 30 x 2 = 60 capsules.

Now, we add the number of capsules sold for each type of amoxicillin:
* Total capsules sold every 2 weeks = 32 + 60 = 92 capsules.

Answer: 92 capsules.
