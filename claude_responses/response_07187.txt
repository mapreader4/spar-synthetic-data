Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Let's represent the number of cookies in the jar as x.
2) If we take 1 cookie away, we would have x-1 cookies in the jar.
3) If we add 5 cookies, we would have x+5 cookies in the jar.
4) The problem states that taking 1 cookie away would leave half as many in the jar as if 5 were added.
5) So we can write the equation: (x-1) = (x+5)/2
6) Solving for x, we get:
2(x-1) = x+5
2x - 2 = x + 5
x = 7
Answer: 7
