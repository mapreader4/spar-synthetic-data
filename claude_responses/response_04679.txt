Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were a total of 42 baby sea turtles that hatched
* One-third of them got swept to the sea by a wave
* To find the number of turtles that got swept to the sea, we take one-third of the total:
* 1/3 of 42 = 42 / 3 = 14 turtles got swept to the sea
* Now, to find the number of turtles still on the sand, we take the total number of turtles (42) and subtract the number that got swept to the sea (14):
* 42 - 14 = 28 turtles are still on the sand

Answer: 28
