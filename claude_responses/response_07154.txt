Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexis bought 3 times more pants and dresses than Isabella
* Alexis bought 21 pairs of pants and 18 dresses
* To find how many pairs of pants and dresses Isabella bought, we need to divide Alexis' total by 3
* Alexis' total number of pants and dresses = 21 + 18 = 39
* Isabella's total number of pants and dresses = 39 / 3 = 13

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 13
