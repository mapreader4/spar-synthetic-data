Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Karen can paddle 10 miles per hour on a still pond.
2) The river is flowing in the opposite direction at 4 miles per hour.
3) This means that Karen's effective speed while paddling up the river is 10 miles per hour - 4 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.
4) The river is 12 miles long.
5) To calculate the time it takes Karen to paddle up the 12-mile river, we divide the distance by her effective speed:
12 miles / 6 miles per hour = 2 hours.

Answer: 2 hours.
