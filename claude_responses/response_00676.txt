Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John needs to take 2 pills a day
* Each pill costs $1.5
* The insurance covers 40% of the cost

First, let's calculate the total cost of the pills for the 30-day month:
* 2 pills per day x 30 days = 60 pills
* 60 pills x $1.5 per pill = $90 total cost

Now, let's calculate the amount that the insurance covers:
* 40% of $90 = $36

Finally, let's calculate the amount that John has to pay:
* $90 total cost - $36 covered by insurance = $54

Answer: $54
