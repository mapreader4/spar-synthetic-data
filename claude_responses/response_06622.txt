Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Louis has 5 oranges and 3 apples, so he has a total of 5 + 3 = 8 fruits.
2) Samantha has 8 oranges and 7 apples, so she has a total of 8 + 7 = 15 fruits.
3) Marley has twice as many oranges as Louis, which is 2 * 5 = 10 oranges.
4) Marley has three times as many apples as Samantha, which is 3 * 7 = 21 apples.
5) In total, Marley has 10 oranges + 21 apples = 31 fruits.

Answer: 31
