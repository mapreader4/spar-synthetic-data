Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each graduate can bring 2 parents.
2) There are 50 graduates.
3) So the number of parents attending is 50 * 2 = 100.
4) There are 20 teachers attending.
5) There are half as many administrators as teachers, so the number of administrators is 20 / 2 = 10.
6) Adding up the total number of people attending:
   - 50 graduates
   - 100 parents
   - 20 teachers
   - 10 administrators
7) The total number of people attending is 50 + 100 + 20 + 10 = 180.

Answer: 180
