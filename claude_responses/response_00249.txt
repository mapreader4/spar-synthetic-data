Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Caleb originally picked 40 dandelion puffs.
2) He gave 3 to his mom, 3 to his sister, 5 to his grandmother, and 2 to his dog.
3) So the total number of dandelion puffs given away is 3 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 13.
4) That means the number of dandelion puffs remaining is 40 - 13 = 27.
5) Caleb divided the remaining 27 dandelion puffs equally among his 3 friends.
6) To find how many each friend received, we divide 27 by 3: 27 / 3 = 9.
