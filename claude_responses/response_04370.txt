Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Kaiden and Adriel each picked 400 apples initially
* They then each picked 3/4 times as many as they had picked earlier
* 3/4 of 400 is 300, so they each picked an additional 300 apples
* They still needed to pick 600 apples each to reach the target number

To find the target number, we need to add up the total number of apples they picked:
* Kaiden and Adriel each picked 400 apples initially, so that's 800 apples
* They each picked an additional 300 apples, so that's 600 more apples
* They still needed to pick 600 apples each, so that's 1200 more apples

Adding up the total:
* 800 + 600 + 1200 = 2600 apples

Therefore, the target number of apples they were trying to pick was 2600.

Answer: 2600
