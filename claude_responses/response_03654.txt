Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Philip has 20 cows
2) He has 50% more ducks than cows. 50% of 20 is 10, so he has 20 + 10 = 30 ducks.
3) He has as many pigs as one-fifth of the total number of ducks and cows. 
4) The total number of ducks and cows is 20 + 30 = 50.
5) One-fifth of 50 is 10, so Philip has 10 pigs.
6) Adding up all the animals, we get:
   - 20 cows
   - 30 ducks
   - 10 pigs
   - Total: 20 + 30 + 10 = 60 animals

Answer: 60
