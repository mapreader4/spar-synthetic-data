Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 28 students in the classroom
* Half of the students have 5 notebooks each
* The other half of the students have 3 notebooks each

First, let's calculate the number of notebooks for the students who have 5 notebooks each:
* Half of 28 students is 14 students
* 14 students with 5 notebooks each = 14 x 5 = 70 notebooks

Now, let's calculate the number of notebooks for the students who have 3 notebooks each:
* The other half of 28 students is also 14 students
* 14 students with 3 notebooks each = 14 x 3 = 42 notebooks

Finally, to get the total number of notebooks in the classroom, we add the two amounts together:
* 70 notebooks + 42 notebooks = 112 notebooks

Answer: 112
