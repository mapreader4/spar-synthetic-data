Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The hot dog stand sells 10 hot dogs every hour
* Each hot dog sells for $2
* We want to find how many hours the stand needs to run to make $200 in sales

First, let's calculate the revenue per hour:
* 10 hot dogs per hour x $2 per hot dog = $20 per hour

Now, we need to find how many hours it will take to reach $200 in sales:
* $200 in sales / $20 per hour = 10 hours

Therefore, the hot dog stand needs to run for 10 hours to make $200 in sales.
