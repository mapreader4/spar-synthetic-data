Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Day 1:
* There were 50 oysters on the rocks
* There were 72 crabs by the beach

Day 2:
* The number of oysters on the rocks was only half of the previous day, so 50 / 2 = 25 oysters
* The number of crabs by the beach was only 2/3 of the previous day, so 72 * 2/3 = 48 crabs

Now, to find the total number of oysters and crabs counted over the two days:
* Day 1: 50 oysters + 72 crabs = 122 total
* Day 2: 25 oysters + 48 crabs = 73 total
* Total over the two days: 122 + 73 = 195 total

Answer: 195
