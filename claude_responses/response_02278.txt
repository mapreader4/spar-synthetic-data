Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Johnny can walk 3 dogs at once
* He gets paid $15 for a 30-minute walk and $20 for a 60-minute walk
* Johnny works for 4 hours per day
* 6 dogs have 60-minute walks per day

First, let's calculate how many 60-minute walks Johnny can do in 4 hours:
* 4 hours = 240 minutes
* 60-minute walks = 240 minutes / 60 minutes = 4 walks

Next, let's calculate how many 30-minute walks Johnny can do in the remaining time:
* Remaining time = 240 minutes - (4 walks * 60 minutes) = 0 minutes
* So Johnny can do 0 additional 30-minute walks

Now, let's calculate Johnny's earnings for the day:
* 4 walks at $20 each = $80

Finally, let's calculate Johnny's earnings for the week:
* 5 days of work at $80 per day = $400

Answer: $400
