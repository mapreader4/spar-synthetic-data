Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 133 people at the camp in total.
* There were 33 more boys than girls.
* Let's represent the number of girls as x.
* Then, the number of boys would be x + 33.
* The total number of people is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls.
* So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 33) = 133
* Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 33 = 133
* Subtracting 33 from both sides, we get: 2x = 100
* Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 50
* Therefore, the number of girls at the camp is 50.

Answer: 50
