Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Jason joined the military at age 18.
2) It took him 8 years to reach the rank of chief.
3) It then took him 25% longer to go from chief to master chief.
   * 25% of 8 years is 2 years.
   * So it took him 8 + 2 = 10 years to go from chief to master chief.
4) He then spent 10 more years in the military before retiring.
   * So the total time he spent in the military is 8 + 10 + 10 = 28 years.
5) He joined the military at age 18, and spent 28 years in the military.
   * Therefore, he retired at age 18 + 28 = 46.

Answer: 46
