Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sandra saved $10 for the sweets.
2) Her mother gave her an additional $4.
3) Her father gave her twice as much as her mother, which is $8.
4) So the total amount of money Sandra has is $10 + $4 + $8 = $22.
5) She wants to buy 14 candies, and each candy costs $0.5.
6) So the total cost of the candies is 14 * $0.5 = $7.
7) She also wants to buy 20 jelly beans, and each jelly bean costs $0.2.
8) So the total cost of the jelly beans is 20 * $0.2 = $4.
9) The total cost of the sweets is $7 + $4 = $11.
10) The amount of money Sandra will be left with after the purchase is $22 - $11 = $11.
