Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* We are given that 8 liters is 20% of the capacity of a container filled with water.
* To find the total capacity of the container, we can use the following equation:
* 8 liters = 20% of the total capacity
* Therefore, the total capacity of the container is:
* 8 liters / 0.20 = 40 liters
* Now, we are asked to calculate the total capacity of 40 such containers filled with water.
* To do this, we simply multiply the capacity of one container (40 liters) by the number of containers (40):
* 40 liters x 40 containers = 1,600 liters

Answer: 1,600
