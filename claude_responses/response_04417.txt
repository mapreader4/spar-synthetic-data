Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Levi has scored 8 times
* His brother has scored 12 times
* Levi wants to beat his brother by at least 5 baskets
* His brother scores another 3 times

First, we need to find out how many baskets Levi needs to score in total to beat his brother by at least 5 baskets.
* His brother's final score will be 12 + 3 = 15 baskets
* Levi needs to score at least 15 + 5 = 20 baskets to beat his brother by at least 5 baskets

Now, we need to find out how many more times Levi needs to score to reach his goal of 20 baskets.
* Levi has already scored 8 times
* He needs to score 20 baskets total
* So, he needs to score 20 - 8 = 12 more times

Answer: 12
