Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The boy has 12 oranges.
2) He gives one-third of this number to his brother.
   * One-third of 12 is 4, so he gives his brother 4 oranges.
3) The remaining number of oranges is 12 - 4 = 8.
4) He then gives one-fourth of the remainder (8) to his friend.
   * One-fourth of 8 is 2, so he gives his friend 2 oranges.
