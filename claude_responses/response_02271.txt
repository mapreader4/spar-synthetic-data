Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Last year, 200 people signed up for the Fun Run.
2. 40 people did not show up to run.
3. Therefore, the number of people who actually ran last year is 200 - 40 = 160 people.
4. This year, there will be twice as many runners as last year.
5. Twice the number of runners from last year is 160 x 2 = 320 people.

Answer: 320
