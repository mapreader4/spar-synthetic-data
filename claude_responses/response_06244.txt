Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The master bedroom and bath totaled 500 sq ft.
2) The 2 guest bedrooms were 200 sq ft each, so 2 * 200 = 400 sq ft.
3) The kitchen, guest bath, and living area totaled 600 sq ft.
4) Adding up all the square footage, we get:
   500 + 400 + 600 = 1,500 sq ft.
5) Tony spends $3,000 a month on rent.
6) To calculate the cost per sq ft, we divide the monthly rent by the total square footage:
   $3,000 / 1,500 sq ft = $2 per sq ft.
