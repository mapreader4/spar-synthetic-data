Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The saline drip makes 20 drops per minute.
2) The treatment lasts for 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
3) So in 120 minutes, the number of drops will be 20 drops/minute * 120 minutes = 2,400 drops.
4) Every 100 drops equals 5 ml of liquid.
5) So 2,400 drops would be equivalent to (2,400 / 100) * 5 ml = 120 ml of liquid.

Answer: 120 ml
