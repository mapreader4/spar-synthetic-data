Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Rob takes 1 hour to get to the national park.
2) Mark takes three times as much time as Rob to get to the national park, which means it takes Mark 3 hours to get to the national park.
3) Rob leaves his home at 11 a.m. and it takes him 1 hour to get to the national park, so he arrives at 12 p.m.
4) Mark needs to arrive at the national park at the same time as Rob, which is 12 p.m.
5) Since it takes Mark 3 hours to get to the national park, he needs to leave his home 3 hours before 12 p.m., which is 9 a.m.

Answer: 9 a.m.
