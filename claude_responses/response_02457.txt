Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The colony starts with 80,000 bees.
2) The colony is losing 1,200 bees per day.
3) We want to find how many days it will take for the colony to reach a fourth of its initial number.
4) A fourth of the initial number is 80,000 / 4 = 20,000 bees.
5) To find how many days it will take to reach 20,000 bees, we can divide the initial number minus the target number by the daily loss:
(80,000 - 20,000) / 1,200 = 60,000 / 1,200 = 50 days.

Answer: 50 days.
