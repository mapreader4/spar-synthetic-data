Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rose wants to buy:
  - A paintbrush that costs $2.40
  - A set of paints that costs $9.20
  - An easel that costs $6.50
* So the total cost of the items Rose wants to buy is:
  - $2.40 + $9.20 + $6.50 = $18.10
* Rose already has $7.10
* To calculate how much more money Rose needs, we take the total cost ($18.10) and subtract the amount she already has ($7.10):
  - $18.10 - $7.10 = $11.00

Answer: $11
