Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Without the bonus, John makes $80 a day for 8 hours of work.
   * This means his hourly rate without the bonus is $80 / 8 = $10 per hour.

2. With the bonus, John makes an extra $20 a day.
   * This means his total daily earnings with the bonus is $80 + $20 = $100.

3. However, with the bonus, John's workday is 10 hours long (8 hours + 2 extra hours).
   * This means his hourly rate with the bonus is $100 / 10 = $10 per hour.

Therefore, if John decides to earn the bonus, he makes $10 per hour.
