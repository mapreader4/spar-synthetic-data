Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Donny has $78 in his piggy bank.
2) Donny buys a kite for $8.
3) Donny buys a frisbee for $9.
4) To calculate the amount of money Donny has left, we need to subtract the cost of the kite and frisbee from the original $78 he had in his piggy bank.
5) $78 - $8 (kite) - $9 (frisbee) = $61.

Answer: 61
