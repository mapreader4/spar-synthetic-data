Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first crane is 228 feet tall and is finishing a building that is 200 feet tall. The difference in height between the crane and the building is:
   228 feet - 200 feet = 28 feet

2. The second crane is 120 feet tall and is finishing a building that is 100 feet tall. The difference in height between the crane and the building is:
   120 feet - 100 feet = 20 feet

3. The third crane is 147 feet tall and is finishing a building that is 140 feet tall. The difference in height between the crane and the building is:
   147 feet - 140 feet = 7 feet

4. To find the average percentage that the cranes are taller than the buildings, we need to:
   a. Add up the differences in height: 28 feet + 20 feet + 7 feet = 55 feet
   b. Add up the heights of the buildings: 200 feet + 100 feet + 140 feet = 440 feet
   c. Divide the total difference in height by the total height of the buildings: 55 feet / 440 feet = 0.125
   d. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.125 * 100 = 12.5%

Answer: 12.5%
