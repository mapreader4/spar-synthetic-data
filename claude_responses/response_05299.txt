Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Dianne has 1000 customers.
2. 37% of her 1000 customers end up returning their books.
   * 37% of 1000 = 0.37 * 1000 = 370 customers return their books.
3. Each book costs $15.
4. To calculate the total sales before returns:
   * Total sales = 1000 customers * $15 per book = $15,000
5. To calculate the total returns:
   * Total returns = 370 customers returning books * $15 per book = $5,550
6. To calculate the net sales after subtracting the returns:
   * Net sales = Total sales - Total returns
   * Net sales = $15,000 - $5,550 = $9,450

Answer: $9,450
