Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   * Let's say Han visited x rehabilitation centers.
   * Then Jane visited 2x + 6 rehabilitation centers.

2) Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did.
   * Let's say Jude visited y rehabilitation centers.
   * Then Han visited 2y - 2 rehabilitation centers.

3) Jude visited half fewer rehabilitation centers than Lisa did.
   * Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.
   * Then Jude visited 6/2 = 3 rehabilitation centers.

Now, we can plug in the values and solve for the total number of rehabilitation centers visited:
* Jane visited 2x + 6 rehabilitation centers
* Han visited 2y - 2 rehabilitation centers
* Jude visited 3 rehabilitation centers
* Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers

The total number of rehabilitation centers visited is:
(2x + 6) + (2y - 2) + 3 + 6 = 2x + 2y + 7

Since the question states that they all visited different rehabilitation centers, the total number of rehabilitation centers visited is:
Answer: 2x + 2y + 7
