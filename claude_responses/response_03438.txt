Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* On the first day, Penn made $10.
* Every day after that, she made $4 more than the previous day.
* We want to know how much money she made after 5 days.

Let's calculate the amount she made each day:
* Day 1: $10
* Day 2: $10 + $4 = $14
* Day 3: $14 + $4 = $18
* Day 4: $18 + $4 = $22
* Day 5: $22 + $4 = $26

Now, we can add up the total amount she made over the 5 days:
* $10 + $14 + $18 + $22 + $26 = $90

Answer: 90
