Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The recipe calls for 1/4 cup of key lime juice, but Audrey likes to double the amount to make it extra tart.
2) So the amount of key lime juice Audrey needs is 1/4 cup x 2 = 1/2 cup.
3) Each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice.
4) There are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup.
5) To find the number of key limes needed, we need to convert the 1/2 cup of juice to tablespoons:
1/2 cup x 16 tablespoons/cup = 8 tablespoons of juice needed.
6) Since each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice, Audrey needs 8 key limes.
