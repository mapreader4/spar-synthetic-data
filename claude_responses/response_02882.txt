Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that a gallon of paint is used to paint the walls.
2) Dexter used 3/8 of the gallon of paint.
3) Jay used 5/8 of the gallon of paint.
4) We are told that a gallon is equal to 4 liters.
5) To find the amount of paint left, we need to subtract the amount used by Dexter and Jay from the total amount of paint.
6) Dexter used 3/8 of the gallon, which is 3/8 * 4 = 1.5 liters.
7) Jay used 5/8 of the gallon, which is 5/8 * 4 = 2.5 liters.
8) The total amount of paint used by Dexter and Jay is 1.5 + 2.5 = 4 liters.
9) The total amount of paint in the gallon is 4 liters.
10) The amount of paint left is 4 liters - 4 liters = 0 liters.

Answer: 0 liters
