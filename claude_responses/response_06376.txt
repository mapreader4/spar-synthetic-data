Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The party collected $2000 with half the school in attendance
* The school had 400 people total
* So, if half the school attended, that means 200 people attended the party
* Now, we want to know how much they would have made if 300 people attended
* To calculate this, we can set up a proportion:
* 200 people attended and they made $2000
* 300 people attended and they would have made x
* So, the proportion is: 200 / 2000 = 300 / x
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = (300 * 2000) / 200 = $3000

Answer: $3000
