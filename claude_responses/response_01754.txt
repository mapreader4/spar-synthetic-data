Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Emma got $2000 from the bank.
2) She bought $400 of furniture, so she has $2000 - $400 = $1600 left.
3) She gave 3/4 of the rest to her friend Anna. 3/4 of $1600 is 3/4 * $1600 = $1200.
4) So, the amount left with Emma is $1600 - $1200 = $400.

Answer: 400
