Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Abe finds 4 ants on the sidewalk.

2. Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. 50% of 4 is 2, so Beth sees 4 + 2 = 6 ants.

3. CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe, which is 2 x 4 = 8 ants.

4. Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe, which is 4 / 2 = 2 ants.

Now, we add up the total number of ants found by the four children:
Abe: 4 ants
Beth: 6 ants
CeCe: 8 ants
Duke: 2 ants

Total ants found = 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20 ants

Answer: 20
