Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Patricia has 4 barrels
* Each barrel can hold 7 gallons
* The faucet has a flow rate of 3.5 gallons per minute
* To find the total time it will take to fill all 4 barrels, we need to:
1. Calculate the total volume of all 4 barrels
2. Divide the total volume by the flow rate of the faucet

Step 1: Calculate the total volume of all 4 barrels
* Each barrel can hold 7 gallons
* There are 4 barrels
* Total volume = 4 barrels x 7 gallons per barrel = 28 gallons

Step 2: Divide the total volume by the flow rate of the faucet
* Total volume = 28 gallons
* Flow rate = 3.5 gallons per minute
* Time to fill all 4 barrels = 28 gallons / 3.5 gallons per minute = 8 minutes

Answer: 8 minutes
