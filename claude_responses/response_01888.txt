Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The New York City Council bought 200 streetlights to modernize its squares.
2) There are 15 squares in New York.
3) Each square will have 12 new streetlights bought by the city council.
4) To calculate the total number of streetlights that will be used, we multiply the number of squares (15) by the number of streetlights per square (12):
15 squares x 12 streetlights per square = 180 streetlights used.
5) The total number of streetlights bought was 200.
6) To find the number of unused streetlights, we subtract the number of streetlights used (180) from the total number of streetlights bought (200):
200 - 180 = 20 unused streetlights.

Answer: 20
