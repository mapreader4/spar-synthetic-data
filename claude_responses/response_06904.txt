Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jonny climbed 1269 stairs last week.
2) Julia climbed 7 less than one-third of the amount Jonny climbed.
3) To find one-third of 1269, we divide 1269 by 3: 1269 / 3 = 423.
4) Since Julia climbed 7 less than one-third of 1269, we subtract 7 from 423: 423 - 7 = 416.
5) So Julia climbed 416 stairs.
6) To find the total number of stairs climbed by Julia and Jonny, we add their individual amounts: 1269 + 416 = 1685.

Answer: 1685
