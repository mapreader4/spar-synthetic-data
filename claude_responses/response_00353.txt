Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Remy paid a total of $20,700 for 150 pieces of furniture
* The cost of each piece of furniture is $134
* To calculate the correct total cost, we multiply the cost per piece ($134) by the number of pieces (150):
$134 x 150 = $20,100
* The amount that Remy was overcharged is the difference between the total he paid ($20,700) and the correct total ($20,100):
$20,700 - $20,100 = $600
* Therefore, Sally's Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy $600.

Answer: 600
