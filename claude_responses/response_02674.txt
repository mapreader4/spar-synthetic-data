Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys.
* On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner got her 3 more.
* So on Tuesday, Daisy had 3 + 3 = 6 dog toys.
* On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner bought her 5 more.
* Now, if Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, that means Daisy would have:
* The 5 dog toys from Monday
* The 6 dog toys from Tuesday
* The 5 dog toys from Wednesday
* Adding these up:
* 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

Answer: 16
