Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cameron usually answers 2 questions per tourist
* He did 4 tours today
* The first group had 6 people
* The second group had 11 people
* The third group had 8 people, but one person asked 3 times as many questions as usual
* The fourth group had 7 people

For the first group:
* 6 people x 2 questions each = 12 questions

For the second group:
* 11 people x 2 questions each = 22 questions

For the third group:
* 7 people x 2 questions each = 14 questions
* 1 person asked 3 times as many questions, so 3 x 2 = 6 additional questions
* Total for third group = 14 + 6 = 20 questions

For the fourth group:
* 7 people x 2 questions each = 14 questions

Now, we add up the total questions answered:
* 12 + 22 + 20 + 14 = 68 questions

Answer: 68
