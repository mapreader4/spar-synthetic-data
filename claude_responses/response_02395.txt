Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The chef served 58 adults.
2) The number of children is 35 fewer than the number of adults. So, the number of children is 58 - 35 = 23.
3) The number of seniors is twice the number of children. So, the number of seniors is 2 * 23 = 46.
4) The total number of guests served is the sum of the adults, children, and seniors:
   Total guests = 58 adults + 23 children + 46 seniors
   Total guests = 58 + 23 + 46
   Total guests = 127

Answer: 127
