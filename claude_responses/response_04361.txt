Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head.
2) We have a total of 20 heads and legs in the flock.
3) To find the number of tripodasauruses, we need to set up an equation:
   * Let x = the number of tripodasauruses in the flock
   * Each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head, so the total number of legs and heads is 4x
   * We are told the total number of heads and legs is 20
   * So we can write the equation: 4x = 20
4) Solving for x, we get:
   * x = 20/4
   * x = 5
Answer: 5
