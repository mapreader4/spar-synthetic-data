Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John is 15 cm taller than Lena
* John is 6 cm shorter than Rebeca
* John's height is 152 cm

First, we can find Lena's height:
* John is 15 cm taller than Lena
* So Lena's height = John's height - 15 cm
* Lena's height = 152 cm - 15 cm = 137 cm

Next, we can find Rebeca's height:
* John is 6 cm shorter than Rebeca
* So Rebeca's height = John's height + 6 cm
* Rebeca's height = 152 cm + 6 cm = 158 cm

Now, to find the height of Lena and Rebeca together:
* Lena's height = 137 cm
* Rebeca's height = 158 cm
* Total height of Lena and Rebeca = 137 cm + 158 cm = 295 cm

Answer: 295 cm
