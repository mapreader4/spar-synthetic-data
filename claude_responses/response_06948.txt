Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kim plants 80 cherry pits.
2) 25% of the 80 pits sprout. To calculate 25% of 80, we can multiply 80 by 0.25 (since 25% = 0.25):
   80 * 0.25 = 20
   So, 20 of the 80 pits sprout.
3) Kim sells 6 of the saplings.
4) To find how many saplings she has left, we take the 20 saplings that sprouted and subtract the 6 that she sold:
   20 - 6 = 14

Answer: 14
