Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. In the first week, the corn plants grew 2 inches.

2. In the second week, the corn plants grew twice as much as they did in the first week. That means they grew 2 x 2 = 4 inches.

3. In the third week, the corn plants grew 4 times as much as they did in the second week. That means they grew 4 x 4 = 16 inches.

Now, we need to add up the total growth over the three weeks:
2 inches (week 1) + 4 inches (week 2) + 16 inches (week 3) = 22 inches

Answer: 22
