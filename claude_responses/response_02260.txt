Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The school has a deaf-student population that is 3 times its blind-student population.
2) Let's represent the number of blind students as x.
3) Then, the number of deaf students is 3x.
4) The total number of students is 180.
5) So, the total number of students is the sum of the deaf students and the blind students:
x + 3x = 180
4x = 180
x = 45

Answer: 45
