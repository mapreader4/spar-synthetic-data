Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) On each of 7 Mondays, it rained 1.5 centimeters.
2) To calculate the total amount of rain on Mondays, we multiply the amount of rain per Monday (1.5 cm) by the number of Mondays (7):
   1.5 cm x 7 = 10.5 cm
3) On each of 9 Tuesdays, it rained 2.5 centimeters.
4) To calculate the total amount of rain on Tuesdays, we multiply the amount of rain per Tuesday (2.5 cm) by the number of Tuesdays (9):
   2.5 cm x 9 = 22.5 cm
5) To calculate the difference between the rain on Tuesdays and Mondays, we subtract the total rain on Mondays from the total rain on Tuesdays:
   22.5 cm - 10.5 cm = 12 cm

Answer: 12 cm
