Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams.
2) Let's represent Williams' money as x.
3) Then, Jackson's money would be 5x.
4) Together, they have $150, so we can write the equation:
x + 5x = 150
6x = 150
x = 25
5) Therefore, Williams has $25.
6) Since Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, Jackson has 5 * $25 = $125.

Answer: 125
