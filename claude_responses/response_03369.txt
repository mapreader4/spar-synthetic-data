Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Iris picked 30 blueberries, her sister picked 20 cranberries, and her brother picked 10 raspberries.
2. The total number of berries they picked is 30 + 20 + 10 = 60 berries.
3. 1/3 of the total berries are rotten, so 1/3 of 60 = 20 berries are rotten.
4. The remaining 60 - 20 = 40 berries are fresh.
5. 1/2 of the fresh berries need to be kept, so 1/2 of 40 = 20 berries need to be kept.
6. The remaining 40 - 20 = 20 berries can be sold.

Answer: 20 berries
