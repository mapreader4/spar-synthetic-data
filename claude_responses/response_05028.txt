Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The problem states that it takes 1 person 10 hours to solve the problem.
* This means the amount of work required to solve the problem is 10 hours.
* If we add a second person who is equally good at math, the two of them can work together to solve the problem.
* Since they are equally good, the amount of work they can complete in 1 hour is double the amount of work 1 person can complete in 1 hour.
* Therefore, the two people working together can complete the 10 hours of work in half the time, which is 5 hours.

Answer: 5
