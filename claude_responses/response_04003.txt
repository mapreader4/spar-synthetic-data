Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joanna has $8
* Her brother has thrice as much as Joanna
* To find her brother's amount, we multiply Joanna's amount by 3:
  * Brother's amount = 3 x $8 = $24
* Her sister has only half as much as Joanna
* To find her sister's amount, we divide Joanna's amount by 2:
  * Sister's amount = $8 / 2 = $4
* Now, to find the total amount of money the three of them have, we add up their individual amounts:
  * Total amount = Joanna's amount + Brother's amount + Sister's amount
  * Total amount = $8 + $24 + $4 = $36

Answer: 36
