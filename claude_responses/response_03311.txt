Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Porter's most recent painting sold for $44,000
* The most recent painting sold for $1,000 less than five times more than his previous painting
* Let's represent the amount he made from the previous painting as "x"
* The most recent painting sold for 5x - $1,000
* We know the most recent painting sold for $44,000, so we can set up an equation:
44,000 = 5x - 1,000
* Solving for x, we get:
45,000 = 5x
x = 9,000

Answer: $9,000
