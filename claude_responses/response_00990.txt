Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Grace charges $6 per hour for mowing lawns
* She mowed lawns for 63 hours in September
* So for mowing lawns, she earned:
    - 63 hours x $6 per hour = $378
* Grace charges $11 per hour for pulling weeds
* She pulled weeds for 9 hours in September
* So for pulling weeds, she earned:
    - 9 hours x $11 per hour = $99
* Grace charges $9 per hour for putting down mulch
* She put down mulch for 10 hours in September
* So for putting down mulch, she earned:
    - 10 hours x $9 per hour = $90
* To calculate her total earnings in September, we add up the earnings from each task:
    - $378 + $99 + $90 = $567

Answer: $567
