Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brent received 5 Kit-Kat bars
* He received three times the amount of Hershey kisses as Kit-Kat bars, which is 3 x 5 = 15 Hershey kisses
* He received 8 boxes of Nerds
* He received 11 lollipops
* He received 10 Baby Ruths
* He received half the amount of Baby Ruths in Reese Peanut Butter cups, which is 10 / 2 = 5 Reese Peanut Butter cups
* After giving his little sister 5 lollipops, he has 11 - 5 = 6 lollipops left

Now, let's add up all the pieces of candy Brent has left:
* 5 Kit-Kat bars
* 15 Hershey kisses
* 8 boxes of Nerds
* 6 lollipops
* 10 Baby Ruths
* 5 Reese Peanut Butter cups

Adding these up, we get:
5 + 15 + 8 + 6 + 10 + 5 = 49 pieces of candy

Answer: 49
