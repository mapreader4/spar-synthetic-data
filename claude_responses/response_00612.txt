Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ali has a total of 125 bottle caps.
2) Out of the 125 caps, 50 are red.
3) To find the number of green caps, we subtract the number of red caps from the total number of caps:
   125 - 50 = 75 green caps.
4) To find the percentage of green caps, we divide the number of green caps by the total number of caps and multiply by 100:
   (75 / 125) * 100 = 60%

Answer: 60
