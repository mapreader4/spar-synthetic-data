Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that the ages of Cynthia's three children add up to 35.
2) We also know that Matthew is two years older than Rebecca and four years younger than Freddy.
3) Let's represent the ages as follows:
   - Rebecca's age: x
   - Matthew's age: x + 2
   - Freddy's age: x + 6
4) We know that the sum of the three ages is 35, so we can write the equation:
   x + (x + 2) + (x + 6) = 35
5) Simplifying this equation, we get:
   3x + 8 = 35
6) Solving for x, we get:
   3x = 27
   x = 9
7) Therefore, Rebecca's age is 9, Matthew's age is 11, and Freddy's age is 15.
