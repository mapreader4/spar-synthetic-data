Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yasna has two books
* The first book is 180 pages long
* The second book is 100 pages long
* Yasna wants to finish both books in two weeks
* She will read an equal number of pages each day

To find the number of pages Yasna needs to read every day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of pages in both books:
   * 180 pages + 100 pages = 280 pages
2. Divide the total number of pages by the number of days in two weeks:
   * 280 pages / 14 days = 20 pages per day

Therefore, Yasna needs to read 20 pages every day to finish both books in two weeks.

Answer: 20
