Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people.
2) At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity.
3) To calculate 3/5 of 80, we multiply 80 by 3/5:
   80 * 3/5 = 48 people
4) So, at the first pickup point, 48 people entered the bus.
5) At the next pickup point, there were 50 people waiting to get on the bus.
6) Since the bus was already at 3/5 of its capacity (48 people), it could only hold 80 - 48 = 32 more people.
7) Therefore, 50 - 32 = 18 people could not take the bus because it was full.

Answer: 18
