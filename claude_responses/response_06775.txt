Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Iris has 3 uncles and 4 aunts
* Each aunt and uncle has a son and a daughter
* Iris also has a brother and her mother
* So the total number of people coming to the party is:
    - 3 uncles
    - 4 aunts
    - 8 cousins (2 per aunt/uncle)
    - 1 brother
    - 1 mother
* Adding these up, we get:
    - 3 uncles + 4 aunts + 8 cousins + 1 brother + 1 mother = 17 people

Answer: 17
