Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Billy is currently 4 years old
* You are currently 4 times older than Billy
* This means your current age is 4 x 4 = 16 years old
* To find your age when Billy was born, we need to subtract Billy's current age (4 years) from your current age (16 years)
* 16 years - 4 years = 12 years
* Therefore, you were 12 years old when Billy was born.

Answer: 12
