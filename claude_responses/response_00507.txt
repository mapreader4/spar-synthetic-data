Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The price of the steaks is $15 per pound.
2) James buys 20 pounds of steaks.
3) The "buy one get one free" promotion means that for every 2 pounds of steaks James buys, he only pays for 1 pound.
4) So, the total number of pounds of steaks James pays for is 20 / 2 = 10 pounds.
5) The total cost for the 10 pounds of steaks is 10 * $15 = $150.

Answer: $150
