Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The school bought 38 pencils, and each pencil costs $2.50
* So the total cost of the 38 pencils is 38 * $2.50 = $95
* The school also bought 56 pens, and each pen costs $3.50
* So the total cost of the 56 pens is 56 * $3.50 = $196
* To find the total cost of the pencils and pens, we add the two amounts together:
* $95 + $196 = $291

Answer: $291
