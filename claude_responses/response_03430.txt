Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Samantha sleeps an average of 8 hours a night.
2) Her baby sister sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha, which means the baby sleeps 8 x 2.5 = 20 hours a night.
3) For every hour the baby sleeps, the father sleeps 30 minutes.
4) In a week, there are 7 days.
5) So in a week, the baby sleeps 20 hours x 7 days = 140 hours.
6) For every 140 hours the baby sleeps, the father sleeps 70 hours (140 hours x 0.5).

Answer: 70 hours.
