Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Julie spent $8 on green lettuce
* Since the green lettuce costs $2 per pound, we can divide the $8 by $2 to find the number of pounds of green lettuce she bought:
* $8 / $2 = 4 pounds of green lettuce
* Julie also spent $6 on red lettuce
* Since the red lettuce also costs $2 per pound, we can divide the $6 by $2 to find the number of pounds of red lettuce she bought:
* $6 / $2 = 3 pounds of red lettuce
* To find the total pounds of lettuce she bought, we add the pounds of green and red lettuce:
* 4 pounds of green lettuce + 3 pounds of red lettuce = 7 total pounds of lettuce
