Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wendy drove 125 miles on the first day
* Wendy drove 223 miles on the second day
* The total miles driven for the 3-day trip is 493 miles

To find the number of miles driven on the third day, we need to subtract the miles driven on the first two days from the total miles driven:
* Total miles driven = 493 miles
* Miles driven on first day = 125 miles
* Miles driven on second day = 223 miles
* Miles driven on third day = Total miles - (Miles on first day + Miles on second day)
* Miles driven on third day = 493 - (125 + 223)
* Miles driven on third day = 493 - 348
* Miles driven on third day = 145 miles

Answer: 145 miles
