Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah uses 1 ounce of shampoo daily
* She uses one half as much conditioner as shampoo, which is 1/2 ounce of conditioner daily
* In two weeks, there are 14 days
* For the shampoo:
    - Sarah uses 1 ounce per day
    - In 14 days, she will use 1 ounce x 14 days = 14 ounces of shampoo
* For the conditioner:
    - Sarah uses 1/2 ounce per day
    - In 14 days, she will use 1/2 ounce x 14 days = 7 ounces of conditioner
* The total volume of shampoo and conditioner that Sarah will use in two weeks is:
    - Shampoo: 14 ounces
    - Conditioner: 7 ounces
    - Total: 14 ounces + 7 ounces = 21 ounces
