Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Thursday, Carlo practiced for 50 minutes
* On Wednesday, he practiced 5 minutes more than on Thursday, so he practiced for 55 minutes
* On Tuesday, he practiced 10 minutes less than on Wednesday, so he practiced for 45 minutes
* On Monday, he practiced twice as long as on Tuesday, so he practiced for 90 minutes

Now, we need to find the total time Carlo practiced from Monday to Thursday:
* Monday: 90 minutes
* Tuesday: 45 minutes
* Wednesday: 55 minutes
* Thursday: 50 minutes
* Total: 90 + 45 + 55 + 50 = 240 minutes

We know that Carlo needs to practice for a total of 5 hours that week, which is 300 minutes.
* Total time needed: 300 minutes
* Time practiced from Monday to Thursday: 240 minutes
* Time needed to practice on Friday: 300 - 240 = 60 minutes

Answer: 60
