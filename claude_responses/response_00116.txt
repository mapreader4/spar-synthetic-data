Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Valerie has 3 thank you cards to send (for her grandmother, uncle, and aunt)
* She has 2 bills to pay (the water bill and the electric bill)
* She has 3 more mail-in rebates than bills, so that's 5 rebates
* She has twice as many job applications as rebates, so that's 10 job applications

Now, let's count the total number of items she needs to mail:
* 3 thank you cards
* 2 bills (the electric bill needs 2 stamps, so that's 3 stamps total for the bills)
* 5 rebates
* 10 job applications

Adding these up, we get:
* 3 + 3 + 5 + 10 = 21 stamps

Answer: 21
