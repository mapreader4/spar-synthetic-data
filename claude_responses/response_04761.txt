Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 100 jellybeans in the glass jar.
2) The kindergarten class normally has 24 kids.
3) 2 children stayed home sick that day, so there are 24 - 2 = 22 children who attended school.
4) Each of the 22 children who attended school ate 3 jellybeans.
5) So the total number of jellybeans eaten is 22 children x 3 jellybeans each = 66 jellybeans.
6) The number of jellybeans still left in the jar is the original 100 jellybeans - the 66 jellybeans that were eaten.

Answer: 34 jellybeans.
