Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Before the new hires:
   - The company has 500 employees
   - Each employee is paid $12 per hour
   - They work 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month
   - So, the monthly pay for each employee is:
     - $12 per hour x 10 hours per day x 5 days per week x 4 weeks per month = $2,400 per month
   - The total monthly pay for the 500 employees is:
     - $2,400 per month x 500 employees = $1,200,000 per month

2. After the new hires:
   - The company hired 200 more people, so now there are 700 employees
   - The monthly pay for each employee is still $2,400
   - The total monthly pay for the 700 employees is:
     - $2,400 per month x 700 employees = $1,680,000 per month

Answer: $1,680,000
