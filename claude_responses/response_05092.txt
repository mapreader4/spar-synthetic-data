Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kevin is taking a 600-mile trip
* He is currently traveling at a rate of 50 miles per hour
* He wants to decrease his travel time by 4 hours

To calculate the new speed he needs to travel at, we can use the formula:
* Time = Distance / Speed

His current travel time is:
* Time = 600 miles / 50 miles per hour = 12 hours

He wants to decrease his travel time by 4 hours, so his new travel time should be:
* 12 hours - 4 hours = 8 hours

Now we can plug this back into the formula to find the new speed he needs to travel at:
* 8 hours = 600 miles / New Speed
* New Speed = 600 miles / 8 hours = 75 miles per hour

Therefore, Kevin must travel 25 miles per hour faster to decrease his travel time by 4 hours.

Answer: 75
