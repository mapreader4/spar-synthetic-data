Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Every Saturday, Kantana buys 2 chocolates for herself and 1 for her sister, which is a total of 3 chocolates per week.
* There are 4 Saturdays in a month.
* So, for the regular weekly purchases, Kantana buys 3 chocolates x 4 weeks = 12 chocolates.
* Additionally, Kantana bought 10 chocolates as a birthday gift for her friend Charlie.
* Therefore, the total number of chocolates Kantana bought for the month is:
* Regular weekly purchases: 12 chocolates
* Birthday gift: 10 chocolates
* Total: 12 + 10 = 22 chocolates

Answer: 22 chocolates
