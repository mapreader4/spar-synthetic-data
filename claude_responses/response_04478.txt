Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lulu has saved $6
* Nora has saved five times what Lulu has, which means Nora has saved $30 (5 x $6)
* Nora's savings are three times Tamara's savings, which means Tamara has saved $10 ($30 / 3)
* The total amount saved is $6 (Lulu) + $30 (Nora) + $10 (Tamara) = $46
* The debt is $40, so the remaining money is $46 - $40 = $6
* If they divide the remaining $6 equally, each girl will get $6 / 3 = $2

Answer: $2
