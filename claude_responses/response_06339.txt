Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, Sofia and her mother bought 10 kgs of oranges.
2) Then, they added 5 more kgs of oranges at the request of their neighbor.
3) So the total quantity of oranges they bought at the store is 10 kgs + 5 kgs = 15 kgs.
4) For the next two weeks, they estimated they would need to buy twice as many oranges each week.
5) That means for the next two weeks, they would need to buy 2 x 15 kgs = 30 kgs of oranges per week.
6) So for the next two weeks, the total quantity of oranges they would need to buy is 2 x 30 kgs = 60 kgs.
7) Adding the initial 15 kgs they bought at the store, the total quantity of oranges they would have bought after the three weeks is 15 kgs + 60 kgs = 75 kgs.
