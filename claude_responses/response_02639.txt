Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mitzi brought $75 to the amusement park
* She spent $30 on a ticket
* She spent $13 on food
* She spent $23 on a T-shirt
* To calculate the amount of money she has left, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she brought:
* Total amount spent = $30 (ticket) + $13 (food) + $23 (T-shirt) = $66
* Amount of money left = $75 (amount brought) - $66 (total amount spent) = $9
