Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, Jamie had 16 red balls and two times more blue balls. This means he had 2 x 16 = 32 blue balls.
2) Later, he lost 6 of the red balls, so he had 16 - 6 = 10 red balls remaining.
3) The total number of balls he had after losing the 6 red balls was 10 red + 32 blue = 42 balls.
4) After this, he bought some yellow balls to fill up his collection, and the total number of balls he had was 74.
5) To find the number of yellow balls he bought, we need to subtract the number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls:
74 - (10 red + 32 blue) = 74 - 42 = 32 yellow balls.

Answer: 32
