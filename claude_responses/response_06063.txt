Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Megan has to spend 20 minutes preparing one dish in the oven
* Each dish can feed 5 people
* Megan spends 2 hours (120 minutes) preparing as many of these dishes as she can

First, we need to find out how many dishes Megan can prepare in 2 hours:
* 120 minutes / 20 minutes per dish = 6 dishes

Now, we can calculate how many people she can feed with these 6 dishes:
* 6 dishes x 5 people per dish = 30 people

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 30
