Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Layla rode her bicycle slowly to the high school
* She then rode 4 miles around the running track at her faster, race pace
* Finally, she rode back home, slowly, on the same route
* Her total mileage was 10 miles

We can represent this as:
* Distance from house to high school + 4 miles + Distance from high school to house = 10 miles

Since the distance from the house to the high school is the same as the distance from the high school to the house, we can simplify this to:
* 2 * (Distance from house to high school) + 4 miles = 10 miles

Solving for the distance from the house to the high school:
* 2 * (Distance from house to high school) = 10 miles - 4 miles
* 2 * (Distance from house to high school) = 6 miles
* Distance from house to high school = 6 miles / 2
* Distance from house to high school = 3 miles

Answer: 3 miles
