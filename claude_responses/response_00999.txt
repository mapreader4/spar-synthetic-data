Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miss Grayson's class raised $50 for their field trip
* Each of her 20 students contributed $5 each
* The cost of the trip is $7 for each student

First, let's calculate the total amount of money raised:
* $50 (from the class fundraiser) + (20 students x $5 each) = $50 + $100 = $150

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the field trip:
* 20 students x $7 per student = $140

Finally, to find the amount left in Miss Grayson's class fund, we subtract the total cost of the field trip from the total amount raised:
* $150 - $140 = $10

Answer: $10
