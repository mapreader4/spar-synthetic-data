Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The trail is 5 miles long
* 60% of the trail is uphill, which means 40% is downhill
* Roberto travels uphill at 2 MPH and downhill at 3 MPH
* To calculate the time it takes to complete the trail, we need to find the time for the uphill portion and the time for the downhill portion, then add them together.

For the uphill portion:
* 60% of 5 miles = 3 miles
* Time to travel 3 miles uphill at 2 MPH = 3 miles / 2 MPH = 1.5 hours

For the downhill portion:
* 40% of 5 miles = 2 miles
* Time to travel 2 miles downhill at 3 MPH = 2 miles / 3 MPH = 0.667 hours

Total time to complete the trail:
* 1.5 hours + 0.667 hours = 2.167 hours

Converting to minutes:
* 2.167 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 130 minutes

Answer: 130 minutes
