To solve this problem, we need to find the average number of times Jason fires his weapon per minute and then multiply it by the duration of each flame shot.

Given information:
- Jason fires his weapon on average every 15 seconds.
- Each time he fires his weapon, the flame lasts for 5 seconds.

Step 1: Find the average number of times Jason fires his weapon per minute.
Number of seconds in a minute = 60 seconds
Average time between each shot = 15 seconds
Average number of shots per minute = 60 seconds / 15 seconds = 4 shots per minute

Step 2: Find the total duration of the flames per minute.
Duration of each flame shot = 5 seconds
Total duration of flames per minute = 4 shots per minute Ã— 5 seconds per shot = 20 seconds per minute

Answer: 20 seconds
