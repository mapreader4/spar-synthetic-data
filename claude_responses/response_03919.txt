Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leila ate 6 cakes on Monday
* Leila ate 9 cakes on Friday
* On Saturday, Leila ate triple the number of cakes she ate on Monday
* To calculate the number of cakes she ate on Saturday, we take the number of cakes she ate on Monday (6) and multiply it by 3:
* 6 cakes x 3 = 18 cakes

Now, to find the total number of cakes Leila ate, we add up the cakes she ate on Monday, Friday, and Saturday:
* 6 cakes + 9 cakes + 18 cakes = 33 cakes

Answer: 33
