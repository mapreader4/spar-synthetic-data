Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Harry ran 10 meters per hour.
2. From Tuesday to Thursday, he ran 50% faster than on Monday.
   - 50% faster means he ran 1.5 times faster than on Monday.
   - So, from Tuesday to Thursday, he ran 1.5 x 10 = 15 meters per hour.
3. On Friday, he ran 60% faster than he ran on Thursday.
   - 60% faster means he ran 1.6 times faster than on Thursday.
   - So, on Friday, he ran 1.6 x 15 = 24 meters per hour.

Answer: 24 meters per hour.
