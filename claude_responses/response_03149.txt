Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Isaac had a 30-meter ribbon.
2) He cut the ribbon into 6 equal parts.
3) Each part of the ribbon is 30 meters / 6 parts = 5 meters.
4) Isaac used 4 parts of the ribbon.
5) The total length of the ribbon used is 4 parts x 5 meters per part = 20 meters.
6) The length of the ribbon not used is the total length (30 meters) minus the length used (20 meters).

Answer: 10 meters
