Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Polly spends 20 minutes cooking breakfast every day
* She spends 5 minutes cooking lunch every day
* She spends 10 minutes cooking dinner 4 days this week
* She spends 30 minutes cooking dinner the remaining 3 days this week

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breakfast and lunch:
* Breakfast: 20 minutes x 7 days = 140 minutes
* Lunch: 5 minutes x 7 days = 35 minutes
* Total for breakfast and lunch: 140 + 35 = 175 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on dinner:
* 4 days at 10 minutes each = 40 minutes
* 3 days at 30 minutes each = 90 minutes
* Total for dinner: 40 + 90 = 130 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on breakfast, lunch, and dinner:
* Total time spent cooking this week: 175 + 130 = 305 minutes

Answer: 305
