Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The larger box is 30 ounces and costs $4.80.
2) To find the price per ounce of the larger box, we divide the total cost by the number of ounces:
$4.80 / 30 ounces = $0.16 per ounce
3) The smaller box is 20 ounces and costs $3.40.
4) To find the price per ounce of the smaller box, we divide the total cost by the number of ounces:
$3.40 / 20 ounces = $0.17 per ounce
5) The larger box has a lower price per ounce at $0.16 per ounce, compared to the smaller box at $0.17 per ounce.
