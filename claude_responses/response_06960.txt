Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mowing the lawn takes 1 hour and pays $15
* Jake wants to make $20/hour working for the neighbors
* Planting the flowers takes 2 hours

To calculate how much Jake should charge for planting the flowers, we need to find the total amount he would make for the entire job (mowing and planting).

For mowing the lawn, he makes $15 in 1 hour. To make $20/hour, he would need to charge:
* $20/hour x 1 hour = $20 for mowing the lawn

For planting the flowers, he needs to work for 2 hours to make $20/hour. So the total charge for planting the flowers should be:
* $20/hour x 2 hours = $40 for planting the flowers

Therefore, the total amount Jake should charge for the entire job (mowing and planting) is:
* $20 (mowing) + $40 (planting) = $60

Answer: $60
