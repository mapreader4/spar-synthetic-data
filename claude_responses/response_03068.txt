Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The store initially had 20 units of mobile phones
* The owner found 5 of those units were defective
* After removing the defective units, the store had 20 - 5 = 15 non-defective units
* Customer A bought 3 units
* Customer C bought 7 units
* The remaining units were sold to Customer B

To find the number of units sold to Customer B, we need to subtract the units sold to Customer A and Customer C from the total non-defective units:
* Total non-defective units: 15
* Units sold to Customer A: 3
* Units sold to Customer C: 7
* Units sold to Customer B: 15 - 3 - 7 = 5

Answer: 5
