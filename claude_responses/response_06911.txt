Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pharmacy already has 20 tubs in storage
* They need a total of 100 tubs for the week
* So, they need to buy (100 - 20) = 80 more tubs
* They buy a quarter of the 80 tubs from the new vendor
* A quarter of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20 tubs
* So, they buy 20 tubs from the new vendor
* The remaining tubs they need to buy is (80 - 20) = 60 tubs
* Therefore, the pharmacy is going to buy 60 tubs from the usual vendor.

Answer: 60
