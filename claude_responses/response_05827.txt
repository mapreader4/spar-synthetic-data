Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ryan got 5 books from the library
* The total number of pages in the 5 books was 2100 pages
* Ryan's brother got 1 book per day, and each book was 200 pages
* They both finished the books in a week (7 days)

To find the average number of pages per day that Ryan read:
* Ryan read a total of 2100 pages
* He read them over the course of 7 days
* So, the average number of pages per day that Ryan read is 2100 / 7 = 300 pages per day

To find the average number of pages per day that Ryan's brother read:
* Ryan's brother read 1 book per day, and each book was 200 pages
* So, the average number of pages per day that Ryan's brother read is 200 pages per day

To find the difference in the average number of pages per day that Ryan read compared to his brother:
* Ryan read an average of 300 pages per day
* His brother read an average of 200 pages per day
* The difference is 300 - 200 = 100 pages per day
