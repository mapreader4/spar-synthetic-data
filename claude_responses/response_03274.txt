Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The aquarium started with 60 fish
* The Bobbit worm eats 2 fish per day
* After two weeks (14 days), the Bobbit worm has eaten 2 fish x 14 days = 28 fish
* So after two weeks, the aquarium has 60 - 28 = 32 fish
* James then adds 8 more fish to the aquarium
* So the aquarium now has 32 + 8 = 40 fish
* A week later, James discovers the Bobbit worm

Therefore, the number of fish in the aquarium when James discovers the Bobbit worm is:
Answer: 40
