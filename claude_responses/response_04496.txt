Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total cost of Sabina's first year of college is $30,000.
2) Sabina has saved $10,000 for her first year.
3) The remainder of the tuition cost is $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000.
4) The grant will cover 40% of the $20,000 remainder, which is 0.4 * $20,000 = $8,000.
5) The amount Sabina needs to apply for a loan to cover is the remaining tuition cost after the grant, which is $20,000 - $8,000 = $12,000.

Answer: $12,000
