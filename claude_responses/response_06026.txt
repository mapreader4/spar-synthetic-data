Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 3 boxes of burritos, and each box has 20 burritos.
   * Total number of burritos = 3 boxes x 20 burritos per box = 60 burritos
2) John gives away a 3rd of the burritos to his friend.
   * Number of burritos given away = 60 burritos x 1/3 = 20 burritos
   * Number of burritos remaining = 60 burritos - 20 burritos = 40 burritos
3) John eats 3 burritos per day for 10 days.
   * Number of burritos eaten = 3 burritos per day x 10 days = 30 burritos
   * Number of burritos remaining = 40 burritos - 30 burritos = 10 burritos

Answer: 10 burritos
