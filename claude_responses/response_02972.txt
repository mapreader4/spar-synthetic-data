Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys a chair
* He then buys a table that is 3 times the price of the chair
* He then buys a couch that is 5 times the price of the table
* John paid $380 for all these items

Let's call the price of the chair 'x'.
* The price of the table is 3x
* The price of the couch is 5 * 3x = 15x

We know that the total cost of all these items is $380, so we can set up an equation:
* x + 3x + 15x = 380
* 19x = 380
* x = 20

Therefore, the price of the chair is $20.
The price of the table is 3 * $20 = $60.
The price of the couch is 15 * $20 = $300.

Answer: $300
