Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first two shipments of couscous were 7 pounds and 13 pounds, arriving on the same day.
2) The total amount of couscous from the first two shipments is 7 + 13 = 20 pounds.
3) The next day, the restaurant received a shipment of 45 pounds of couscous.
4) The total amount of couscous received is 20 + 45 = 65 pounds.
5) It takes 5 pounds of couscous to make one dish.
6) To calculate the number of dishes the restaurant can make, we divide the total amount of couscous (65 pounds) by the amount of couscous needed per dish (5 pounds).
7) 65 pounds / 5 pounds per dish = 13 dishes.

Answer: 13
