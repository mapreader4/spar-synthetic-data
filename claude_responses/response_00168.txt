Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Silvia orders:
   - 2 quiches at $15.00 each, so 2 x $15.00 = $30.00
   - 6 croissants at $3.00 each, so 6 x $3.00 = $18.00
   - 6 buttermilk biscuits at $2.00 each, so 6 x $2.00 = $12.00

2. The total cost of the order before the discount is:
   - $30.00 + $18.00 + $12.00 = $60.00

3. Since the order is over $50.00, Silvia is eligible for a 10% discount.
   - The discount amount is 10% of $60.00, which is $6.00.

4. The final cost of the order with the 10% discount is:
   - $60.00 - $6.00 = $54.00

Answer: $54
