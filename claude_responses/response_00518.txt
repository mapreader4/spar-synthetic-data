Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot. This means that if Elliot has x marbles, then Merill has 2x marbles.
2) Merill and Elliot together have five fewer marbles than Selma.
3) Selma has 50 marbles.
4) So Merill and Elliot together have 50 - 5 = 45 marbles.
5) We know that Merill has 2x marbles, and Elliot has x marbles, so together they have 3x marbles.
6) Therefore, 3x = 45.
7) Solving for x, we get x = 15.
8) Since Merill has 2x marbles, Merill has 2 * 15 = 30 marbles.

Answer: 30
