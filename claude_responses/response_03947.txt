Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sue has 48 nuts.
2) Harry has twice as many nuts as Sue, so Harry has 2 * 48 = 96 nuts.
3) Bill has 6 times as many nuts as Harry, so Bill has 6 * 96 = 576 nuts.
4) To find the combined number of nuts that Bill and Harry have, we add their individual amounts:
Bill's nuts + Harry's nuts = 576 + 96 = 672 nuts.

Answer: 672
