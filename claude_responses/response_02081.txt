Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cassidy is grounded for 14 days for lying about her report card
* She gets an additional 3 extra days for each grade below a B
* Cassidy got 4 grades below a B

To calculate the total number of days Cassidy is grounded for, we need to add the initial 14 days to the additional days for the 4 grades below a B.

The additional days for the 4 grades below a B would be:
* 4 grades x 3 days per grade = 12 additional days

Now, we add the initial 14 days and the additional 12 days:
* 14 days + 12 days = 26 days

Answer: 26 days
