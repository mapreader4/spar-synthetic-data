Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The choir has 70 members in total.
2) The first group has 25 members.
3) The second group has 30 members.
4) To find the number of members in the third group, we need to subtract the members in the first and second groups from the total number of members in the choir.
5) 70 members (total) - 25 members (first group) - 30 members (second group) = 15 members (third group).
