Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The butcher recommends 1/2 pound of meat per person.
2) Antoine is inviting 6 people over.
3) To calculate the total amount of meat needed, we multiply the number of people (6) by the recommended amount of meat per person (1/2 pound):
6 people x 1/2 pound per person = 3 pounds of meat
4) The beef tenderloin costs $15.00 per pound.
5) To calculate the total cost, we multiply the total amount of meat needed (3 pounds) by the cost per pound ($15.00):
3 pounds x $15.00 per pound = $45.00

Answer: $45
