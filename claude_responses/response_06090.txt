Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The gym charges its members $18 twice a month
* This means each member pays $18 x 2 = $36 per month
* The gym has 300 members
* To calculate the total amount the gym makes per month, we need to multiply the amount each member pays per month ($36) by the number of members (300)
* $36 x 300 = $10,800

Answer: $10,800
