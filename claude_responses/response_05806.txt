Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dylan had 8 ice cubes in his glass.
2) When he made the pitcher of lemonade, he put in two times as many ice cubes as he had in the glass. 
   * 2 x 8 = 16 ice cubes in the pitcher
3) The ice cube trays have 12 spaces each for ice cubes.
4) To find the total number of ice cubes used, we add the 8 in the glass and the 16 in the pitcher:
   * 8 + 16 = 24 ice cubes used
5) Since the trays have 12 spaces each, to find the number of trays needed, we divide the total number of ice cubes used by 12:
   * 24 / 12 = 2 trays
