Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Darwin has $45.
2) Mia has $20 more than twice as much money as Darwin.
3) To find how much money Mia has, we first need to calculate twice as much money as Darwin has.
4) Twice as much money as Darwin has is 2 x $45 = $90.
5) Mia has $20 more than $90, so Mia has $90 + $20 = $110.

Answer: $110
