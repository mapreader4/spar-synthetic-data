Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The base fine for speeding is $50.
2. Mark was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone, so he was going 45 miles per hour over the speed limit.
3. The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour over the speed limit, so the additional fine is $2 x 45 = $90.
4. The fine is also doubled because he was in a school zone, so the total fine is $50 + $90 = $140, which is then doubled to $280.
5. The judge also makes Mark pay $300 in court costs.
6. Mark's lawyer charges $80 per hour for three hours of work, so that's an additional $240.

Adding up all the costs:
Base fine: $50
Additional fine for speeding: $90
Doubling the fine for school zone: $140 x 2 = $280
Court costs: $300
Lawyer fees: $240

Answer: $1,160
