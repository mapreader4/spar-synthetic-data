Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mona joined 9 groups over the weekend
* Each group had 5 players (Mona + 4 other players)
* One group had 2 players she had grouped with before
* Another group had 1 player she had grouped with before
* We need to find the total number of unique players Mona grouped with

First, let's calculate the total number of players Mona grouped with:
* 9 groups x 5 players per group = 45 total players

Now, let's account for the players she had grouped with before:
* 1 group had 2 players she had grouped with before
* 1 group had 1 player she had grouped with before
* So, 2 + 1 = 3 players she had grouped with before

Finally, to find the number of unique players Mona grouped with, we subtract the number of players she had grouped with before from the total number of players:
* 45 total players - 3 players she had grouped with before = 42 unique players

Answer: 42
