Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rich first walks 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.
2) Then he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road.
3) So far, he has walked a total of 20 + 200 = 220 feet.
4) He then makes a left and walks double his total distance so far, which is 2 * 220 = 440 feet.
5) Now the total distance he has walked is 220 + 440 = 660 feet.
6) He then walks half the total distance up to this point again to the end of his route, which is 660 / 2 = 330 feet.
7) The total distance he has walked so far is 660 + 330 = 990 feet.
8) Finally, he turns around and walks the same path all the way back home, which is another 990 feet.
9) The total distance Rich walked is 990 + 990 = 1980 feet.

Answer: 1980
