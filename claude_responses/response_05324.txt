Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The ratio of the money split between Parker and Richie is 2:3.
2) This means that Parker's share is 2 parts, and Richie's share is 3 parts.
3) We know that Parker's share is $50, which is the smaller share.
4) Since Parker's share is 2 parts, and his share is $50, we can calculate the value of each part as $50 / 2 = $25.
5) Richie's share is 3 parts, so his share is 3 * $25 = $75.
6) The total amount of money they shared is Parker's share ($50) plus Richie's share ($75), which is $50 + $75 = $125.

Answer: $125
