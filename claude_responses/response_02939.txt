Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Candy throws 4 pebbles into the lake.
2) Lance throws in 3 times as many pebbles as Candy.
3) To calculate how many pebbles Lance threw, we take the number of pebbles Candy threw (4) and multiply it by 3.
4) 4 pebbles x 3 = 12 pebbles
5) So Lance threw 12 pebbles.
6) To calculate how many more pebbles Lance threw compared to Candy, we subtract the number of pebbles Candy threw (4) from the number of pebbles Lance threw (12).
7) 12 pebbles - 4 pebbles = 8 pebbles

Answer: 8
