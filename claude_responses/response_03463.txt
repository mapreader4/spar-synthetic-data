Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John bought 20 cards for Christmas gifts
* John bought 15 cards for birthday gifts
* Each card cost $2

To calculate the total amount spent on cards, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of cards bought
2. Multiply the total number of cards by the cost per card

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards bought
* 20 cards for Christmas gifts
* 15 cards for birthday gifts
* Total cards = 20 + 15 = 35 cards

Step 2: Multiply the total number of cards by the cost per card
* Cost per card = $2
* Total cost = 35 cards x $2 per card = $70

Answer: $70
