Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gerald was sentenced to 3 months for assault
* He was also sentenced to 2 years for poisoning
* Since this is Gerald's third offense, the judge extended his sentence by 1/3

First, let's calculate the total sentence without the 1/3 extension:
* 3 months for assault
* 2 years for poisoning = 24 months
* Total = 3 months + 24 months = 27 months

Now, let's calculate the 1/3 extension:
* 1/3 of 27 months = 9 months

Finally, we add the 1/3 extension to the original sentence:
* 27 months + 9 months = 36 months

Answer: 36 months
