Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Calvin scored 500 points.
2) Paislee scored 3/4 times as many points as Calvin.
3) To find Paislee's score, we multiply Calvin's score by 3/4:
   * Paislee's score = 500 * 3/4 = 375 points.
4) To tie the game, Paislee would need to score the same number of points as Calvin.
5) The difference between Calvin's score and Paislee's score is 500 - 375 = 125 points.
6) Therefore, Paislee would need to score 125 more points to tie the game.

Answer: 125
