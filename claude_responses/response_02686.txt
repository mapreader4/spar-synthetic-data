Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ali caught twice as much fish as Peter
* Let's call the amount of fish Peter caught 'x' kg
* Then, the amount of fish Ali caught is '2x' kg
* Joey caught 1 kg more fish than Peter, so Joey caught 'x+1' kg
* The total amount of fish caught by the three of them is 25 kg
* So, we can write the equation:
2x + x + (x+1) = 25
* Simplifying, we get:
4x + 1 = 25
* Solving for x, we get:
4x = 24
x = 6
* Therefore, the amount of fish Peter caught is 6 kg
* And the amount of fish Ali caught is 2 * 6 = 12 kg

Answer: 12 kg
