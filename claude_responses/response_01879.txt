Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first hour, Benjamin counted 17 billboards.
* In the second hour, Benjamin counted 20 billboards.
* In the third hour, Benjamin counted 23 billboards.
* To find the average number of billboards seen per hour, we need to add up the total number of billboards seen and divide by the number of hours.
* The total number of billboards seen is 17 + 20 + 23 = 60.
* The number of hours is 3.
* To find the average, we divide the total number of billboards by the number of hours:
* 60 billboards / 3 hours = 20 billboards per hour.

Answer: 20
