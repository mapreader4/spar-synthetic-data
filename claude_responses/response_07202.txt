Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Chris has 12 marbles and Ryan has 28 marbles.
2) Together, they have 12 + 28 = 40 marbles in the pile.
3) Each person takes away 1/4 of the marbles from the pile.
4) 1/4 of 40 marbles is 10 marbles.
5) So, each person takes away 10 marbles from the pile.
6) The number of marbles remaining in the pile is 40 - 10 - 10 = 20 marbles.

Answer: 20
