Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed.
2) This means that if Kody's age four years ago was x, then Mohamed's age four years ago was 2x.
3) Currently, Mohamed is twice 30 years old, which means he is 60 years old.
4) Four years ago, Mohamed was 60 - 4 = 56 years old.
5) Since Mohamed was 2x four years ago, we can say that 2x = 56, which means x = 28.
6) Kody's age four years ago was 28 / 2 = 14.
7) Kody's current age is 14 + 4 = 18.

Answer: 18
