Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Helga can write 5 articles every 30 minutes
* She usually works 4 hours a day, 5 days a week
* 4 hours a day = 240 minutes a day
* 240 minutes a day / 30 minutes per 5 articles = 40 articles per day
* 40 articles per day x 5 days a week = 200 articles per week
* Last Thursday, she worked an extra 2 hours
* 2 hours = 120 minutes
* 120 minutes / 30 minutes per 5 articles = 20 extra articles
* Last Friday, she worked an extra 3 hours
* 3 hours = 180 minutes
* 180 minutes / 30 minutes per 5 articles = 30 extra articles
* Total extra articles written = 20 + 30 = 50 articles
