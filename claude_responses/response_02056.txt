Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Randy walks his dog twice a day
* After each walk, he wipes his dog's paws with a baby wipe
* So, he uses 2 baby wipes per day
* There are 360 days in a year
* Therefore, the total number of baby wipes he will need for 360 days is:
2 wipes per day x 360 days = 720 baby wipes

Now, we need to determine how many packs of baby wipes he needs to buy. Each pack contains 120 wipes.
* 720 baby wipes / 120 wipes per pack = 6 packs

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 6 packs
