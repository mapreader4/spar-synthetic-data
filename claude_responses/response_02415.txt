Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* We know that it snowed an additional 4 snowflakes every 5 minutes
* There were 58 snowflakes after 1 hour
* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* 60 minutes / 5 minutes per interval = 12 intervals
* 12 intervals x 4 snowflakes per interval = 48 additional snowflakes
* So, the number of snowflakes at first must have been 58 - 48 = 10 snowflakes

Answer: 10
