Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1. We have two types of rattlesnakes: Eastern and Western.
2. Eastern rattlesnakes have 6 segments in their tails.
3. Western rattlesnakes have 8 segments in their tails.
4. To calculate the percentage difference in their tail size, we need to find the difference in the number of segments and express it as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size.
5. The difference in the number of segments is 8 - 6 = 2.
6. The Western rattlesnake's tail size is 8 segments.
7. The percentage difference would be (2 / 8) * 100 = 25%.

Answer: 25%
