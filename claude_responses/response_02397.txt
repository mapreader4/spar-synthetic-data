Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Nathan played for 3 hours per day for two weeks, every day.
   * 3 hours per day x 7 days per week x 2 weeks = 42 hours

2. Tobias played for 5 hours every day, but only for one week.
   * 5 hours per day x 7 days per week x 1 week = 35 hours

3. To find the total hours played by Nathan and Tobias, we add their individual hours:
   * 42 hours (Nathan) + 35 hours (Tobias) = 77 hours

Answer: 77
