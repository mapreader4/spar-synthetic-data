Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Greg and Sarah have 18 apples that they are going to split evenly.
   * Since they are splitting the apples evenly, each of them will get 18 / 2 = 9 apples.

2. Susan has twice as many apples as Greg will end up with.
   * Greg will end up with 9 apples, so Susan has 2 * 9 = 18 apples.

3. Mark has 5 fewer apples than Susan.
   * Susan has 18 apples, so Mark has 18 - 5 = 13 apples.

4. Their mom needs 40 apples to make an apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples:
* Greg: 9 apples
* Sarah: 9 apples
* Susan: 18 apples
* Mark: 13 apples
* Total: 9 + 9 + 18 + 13 = 49 apples

Their mom needs 40 apples to make the apple pie, so the number of apples left over is:
* 49 apples - 40 apples = 9 apples

Answer: 9
