Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason takes 30 minutes to cut 1 lawn
* He cuts 8 yards on both Saturday and Sunday
* To calculate the total time spent cutting grass, we need to find the total number of yards he cuts and multiply it by the time it takes to cut 1 yard.

The total number of yards he cuts is:
* 8 yards on Saturday + 8 yards on Sunday = 16 yards

Now, we multiply the total number of yards by the time it takes to cut 1 yard:
* 16 yards x 30 minutes per yard = 480 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60:
* 480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours

Answer: 8 hours
