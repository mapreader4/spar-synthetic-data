Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The class has 60 students total
* The number of students who bring their lunch is thrice the number of those who eat in the school cafeteria
* 10 students eat in the school cafeteria
* The rest of the students don't eat lunch

First, let's find the number of students who bring their lunch:
* If 10 students eat in the school cafeteria, then the number of students who bring their lunch is 3 times that, which is 3 * 10 = 30 students

Now, let's find the number of students who don't eat lunch:
* The total number of students is 60
* The number of students who eat in the cafeteria is 10
* The number of students who bring their lunch is 30
* So the number of students who don't eat lunch is 60 - 10 - 30 = 20 students

Answer: 20
