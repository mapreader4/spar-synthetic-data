Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Micah bought 52 stamps
* He has 6 envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds
* Each envelope that weighs less than 5 pounds requires 2 stamps
* So for the 6 envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds, he used 6 * 2 = 12 stamps
* That leaves 52 - 12 = 40 stamps remaining
* Each envelope that weighs more than 5 pounds requires 5 stamps
* So the remaining 40 stamps can be used for 40 / 5 = 8 envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds
* In total, Micah needed to buy 6 + 8 = 14 envelopes.
