Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Springfield has a population of 482,653 people.
2) Greenville has 119,666 fewer people than Springfield.
3) To find the population of Greenville, we subtract 119,666 from the population of Springfield:
   482,653 - 119,666 = 362,987
4) To find the total population of Springfield and Greenville, we add the two populations together:
   482,653 + 362,987 = 845,640

Answer: 845,640
