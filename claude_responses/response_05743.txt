Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark's old plan cost $150 per month
* The new plan is 30% more expensive than the old plan
* To calculate the new plan cost, we need to find 30% of the old plan cost and add it to the old plan cost
* 30% of $150 is 0.30 x $150 = $45
* Adding the 30% increase to the old plan cost: $150 + $45 = $195

Answer: $195
