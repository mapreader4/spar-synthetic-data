Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom swims for 2 hours at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   * Distance covered while swimming = 2 hours x 2 miles per hour = 4 miles

2) Tom then runs for half the time (1 hour) at 4 times the speed.
   * Speed while running = 4 x 2 miles per hour = 8 miles per hour
   * Distance covered while running = 1 hour x 8 miles per hour = 8 miles

3) The total distance covered is the sum of the distance covered while swimming and the distance covered while running.
   * Total distance covered = 4 miles + 8 miles = 12 miles

Answer: 12 miles
