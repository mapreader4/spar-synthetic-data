Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The initial chance of making the junior high basketball team is 10% if you're 66 inches tall.
* The chance increases by 10% for every additional inch of height.
* Devin starts out at 65 inches tall.
* Devin then grows 3 inches, so his final height is 65 + 3 = 68 inches.

Now, let's calculate Devin's chances of making the team:
* At 66 inches, the chance is 10%.
* For each inch above 66 inches, the chance increases by 10%.
* Devin is 2 inches taller than 66 inches, so his chance increases by 2 * 10% = 20%.
* Therefore, Devin's chances of making the basketball team are 10% + 20% = 30%.

Answer: 30
