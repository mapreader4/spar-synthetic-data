Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Lisa has saved $1200 for the gift.
2) Her mother gave her 3/5 times of what she had saved, which is 3/5 * $1200 = $720.
3) Her brother gave her twice the amount her mother gave her, which is 2 * $720 = $1440.
4) The total amount of money Lisa has now is $1200 (her own savings) + $720 (from her mother) + $1440 (from her brother) = $3360.
5) The price of the gift she wanted to buy is $3360 + $400 (the amount she was still short) = $3760.

Answer: $3760
