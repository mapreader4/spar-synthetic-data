Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Veronica needs 3 pounds of pitted cherries to make the pie.
2) There are 80 single cherries in one pound of cherries.
3) Therefore, the total number of cherries Veronica needs is:
   3 pounds x 80 cherries/pound = 240 cherries
4) It takes 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries.
5) To find the total time it takes to pit 240 cherries, we can set up a proportion:
   20 cherries / 10 minutes = 240 cherries / x minutes
6) Solving for x, we get:
   x = (240 cherries * 10 minutes) / 20 cherries = 120 minutes
7) To convert minutes to hours, we divide 120 minutes by 60 minutes/hour:
   120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
