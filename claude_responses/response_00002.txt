Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The wallet costs $100.
2) Betty has only half of the money she needs, which means she has $50.
3) Her parents gave her $15.
4) Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is $30.
5) So the total amount of money Betty has now is $50 + $15 + $30 = $95.
6) To find how much more money she needs, we subtract the total amount she has ($95) from the cost of the wallet ($100).
7) $100 - $95 = $5.
