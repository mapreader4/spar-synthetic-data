Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim drove for 5 hours
* He was stuck in traffic for twice as long as he was driving
* To find the total time of the trip, we need to add the time he was driving and the time he was stuck in traffic

First, let's calculate the time he was stuck in traffic:
* He was stuck in traffic for twice as long as he was driving
* So, if he drove for 5 hours, he was stuck in traffic for 2 * 5 = 10 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time of the trip:
* Time driving: 5 hours
* Time stuck in traffic: 10 hours
* Total time of the trip: 5 hours + 10 hours = 15 hours
