Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* George picks 45 oranges
* George picks 5 more apples than Amelia
* Amelia picks 18 fewer oranges than George
* Amelia picks 15 apples

First, let's calculate how many apples George picked:
* Amelia picked 15 apples
* George picked 5 more apples than Amelia
* So George picked 15 + 5 = 20 apples

Now, let's calculate how many oranges Amelia picked:
* George picked 45 oranges
* Amelia picked 18 fewer oranges than George
* So Amelia picked 45 - 18 = 27 oranges

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits they picked:
* George picked 45 oranges and 20 apples, for a total of 65 fruits
* Amelia picked 27 oranges and 15 apples, for a total of 42 fruits
* The total number of fruits they picked is 65 + 42 = 107 fruits

Answer: 107
