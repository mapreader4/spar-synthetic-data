Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Amy brings 1 muffin to school
* Each day after that, she brings one more muffin than the day before
* So, on Tuesday, she brings 2 muffins
* On Wednesday, she brings 3 muffins
* On Thursday, she brings 4 muffins
* On Friday, she brings 5 muffins
* On Saturday, she has 7 muffins left

Now, let's add up the total number of muffins she brought to school over the week:
* Monday: 1 muffin
* Tuesday: 2 muffins
* Wednesday: 3 muffins
* Thursday: 4 muffins
* Friday: 5 muffins
* Total muffins brought to school: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 muffins

Finally, we add the 7 muffins left on Saturday to the 15 muffins brought to school to get the total number of muffins she originally baked:
* Total muffins baked: 15 + 7 = 22 muffins

Answer: 22
