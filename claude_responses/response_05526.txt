Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The adoption fee was $50.
2. The vet visits cost $500 for the first year.
3. The monthly cost of food was $25.
   - In a year, that's 12 months x $25 = $300.
4. Jenny bought $200 in toys.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Adoption fee: $50
- Vet visits: $500
- Food: $300
- Toys: $200

The total cost for the first year is:
$50 + $500 + $300 + $200 = $1,050

Since Jenny and her girlfriend agreed to split all the costs down the middle, except for the toys, Jenny's share of the costs would be:
$1,050 / 2 = $525

Additionally, Jenny spent $200 on toys.

Therefore, the total amount Jenny spent on the cat in the first year is:
$525 + $200 = $725

Answer: 725
