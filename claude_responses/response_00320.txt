Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Austin bought 7 robots for his friends
* Each robot costs $8.75
* He was charged $7.22 in total for tax
* He left with $11.53 in change

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 7 robots:
* 7 robots x $8.75 per robot = $61.25

Next, we add the tax of $7.22 to the total cost of the robots:
* $61.25 + $7.22 = $68.47

Finally, we add the $11.53 in change that Austin left with to get the total amount he started with:
* $68.47 + $11.53 = $80.00

Answer: $80
