Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mark hired a singer for 3 hours.
2) The singer was paid $15 per hour.
3) To calculate the base pay, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:
   $15 per hour x 3 hours = $45 base pay.
4) Mark then tipped the singer 20% of the base pay.
5) To calculate the tip, we take 20% of the base pay:
   20% of $45 = 0.20 x $45 = $9 tip.
6) The total amount Mark paid is the base pay plus the tip:
   $45 + $9 = $54.

Answer: $54
