Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Aaron and Carson each saved up $40, so their total money is $40 + $40 = $80.
2) The bill is 3/4 of their total money, which means the bill is 3/4 * $80 = $60.
3) After paying the bill, they have $80 - $60 = $20 left.
4) They each get $1 in change, so they each have $10 left.
5) Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.5, and they each have $10 left.
6) To find the number of scoops they each bought, we divide the amount they each have left ($10) by the cost per scoop ($1.5).
7) $10 / $1.5 = 6.67 scoops.
8) Since they can only buy whole scoops, they each bought 6 scoops.
