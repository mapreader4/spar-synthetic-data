Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The retail store wants to hire 50 new phone reps
* Each phone rep will work 8 hours a day
* Each phone rep will be paid $14.00 an hour
* We need to calculate the total amount the company will pay all 50 new employees after 5 days

First, let's calculate the daily pay for each phone rep:
* 8 hours per day x $14.00 per hour = $112.00 per day

Now, let's calculate the total pay for all 50 phone reps over 5 days:
* $112.00 per day x 50 phone reps = $5,600.00 per day
* $5,600.00 per day x 5 days = $28,000.00 total

Answer: $28,000
