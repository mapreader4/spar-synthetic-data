Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Lizette's average score across all three quizzes is 94.
2) Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz.
3) To find the average of her first two quizzes, we can use the formula for average:
   Average = (Sum of all scores) / (Number of scores)
4) Let's call the scores on the first two quizzes x and y.
   Then the total score across all three quizzes is x + y + 92.
   The average of all three quizzes is 94, so:
   (x + y + 92) / 3 = 94
5) Solving for x + y, we get:
   x + y = 94 * 3 - 92 = 190
6) Therefore, the average of Lizette's first two quizzes is 190 / 2 = 95.

Answer: 95
