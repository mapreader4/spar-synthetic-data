Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Polly takes an average of 28 seconds per move
* Peter takes an average of 40 seconds per move
* The match ends after 30 moves

To find the total time of the match, we need to calculate the time for each player's moves and then add them together.

Polly's moves:
* 30 moves x 28 seconds per move = 840 seconds

Peter's moves:
* 30 moves x 40 seconds per move = 1200 seconds

Total time of the match:
* 840 seconds + 1200 seconds = 2040 seconds

Now, we need to convert the total time from seconds to minutes.
* 2040 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 34 minutes

Answer: 34 minutes
