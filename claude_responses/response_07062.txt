Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. So if we let Jason's catch be x, then Ryan's catch would be 3x.
2) Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got. So if Ryan's catch is 3x, then Jeffery's catch would be 2 * 3x = 6x.
3) We know that Jeffery caught 60 fish, so 6x = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 10.
4) Since Jason caught x = 10 fish, Ryan caught 3x = 3 * 10 = 30 fish, and Jeffery caught 60 fish, the total number of fish caught by all of them is:
Jason's catch + Ryan's catch + Jeffery's catch = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 fish.

Answer: 100
