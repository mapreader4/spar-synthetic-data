Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 2 pizzas, each cut into 12 slices, so there are a total of 24 slices.
* Bob ate half of a pizza, which is 6 slices.
* Tom ate one-third of a pizza, which is 4 slices.
* Sally ate one-sixth of a pizza, which is 2 slices.
* Jerry ate a quarter of a pizza, which is 3 slices.
* In total, the four of them ate 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 15 slices.
* Therefore, the number of slices left over is 24 - 15 = 9 slices.
