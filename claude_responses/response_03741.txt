Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roger can walk 2,000 steps in 30 minutes
* His daily goal is 10,000 steps
* To find how many minutes it will take him to reach his goal, we need to find the ratio of the goal steps to the steps he can do in 30 minutes.
* The ratio is 10,000 steps / 2,000 steps per 30 minutes = 5
* This means it will take him 5 times as long to reach his goal as it takes him to do 2,000 steps.
* 30 minutes x 5 = 150 minutes

Answer: 150
