Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Maurice had only been horseback riding a handful of times before visiting Matt
* During the two-week visit, Maurice rode 8 times, and Matt accompanied him each time
* Besides the times he accompanied Maurice, Matt rode an additional 16 times
* The total number of times Matt rode during the two weeks is three times the number of times Maurice had ridden before his visit

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of times Maurice had ridden before visiting Matt
* Then, the total number of times Matt rode during the two weeks is 3x

We know that:
* Maurice rode 8 times during the visit, and Matt accompanied him each time
* Matt rode an additional 16 times on his own
* So the total number of times Matt rode is 8 + 16 = 24

Now we can set up an equation:
* 3x = 24

Solving for x:
* x = 24 / 3
* x = 8

Therefore, Maurice had been horseback riding 8 times before visiting Matt.

Answer: 8
