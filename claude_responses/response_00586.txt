Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sam runs a total of 12 miles
* Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam
* To find how many miles Harvey runs, we add 8 miles to Sam's 12 miles:
* Harvey's total miles = 12 miles + 8 miles = 20 miles
* Now, to find the total number of miles the two friends run together, we add Sam's 12 miles and Harvey's 20 miles:
* Total miles run = 12 miles + 20 miles = 32 miles

Answer: 32
