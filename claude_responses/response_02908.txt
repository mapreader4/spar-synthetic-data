Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bake sale earns a total of $400.
2) Andrew keeps $100 to cover the cost of ingredients, so the remaining total is $400 - $100 = $300.
3) Andrew donates half of the remaining total ($300) to the local homeless shelter, which is $300 / 2 = $150.
4) Andrew also decides to donate $10 from his own piggy bank to the local homeless shelter.
5) Therefore, the total amount of money Andrew donates to the homeless shelter is $150 + $10 = $160.

Answer: 160
