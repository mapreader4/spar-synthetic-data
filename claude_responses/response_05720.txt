Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 100 ladies on the first floor studying.
2) On the second floor, there are three times as many girls at a party.
3) To find the number of girls on the second floor, we multiply the number of ladies on the first floor by 3:
   * 100 ladies x 3 = 300 girls on the second floor.
4) To find the total number of ladies on the two floors, we add the number of ladies on the first floor to the number of girls on the second floor:
   * 100 ladies + 300 girls = 400 ladies in total.

Answer: 400
