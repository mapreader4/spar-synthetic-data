Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that Jacob can write twice as fast as Nathan.
2) Nathan wrote 25 letters in one hour.
3) Since Jacob can write twice as fast as Nathan, in one hour Jacob can write 2 x 25 = 50 letters.
4) In 10 hours, Nathan can write 10 x 25 = 250 letters.
5) In 10 hours, Jacob can write 10 x 50 = 500 letters.
6) Together, in 10 hours, Nathan and Jacob can write 250 + 500 = 750 letters.

Answer: 750
