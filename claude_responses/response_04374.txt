Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Phoebe eats 1 serving of peanut butter per day
* Her dog eats 1 serving of peanut butter per day
* Each jar of peanut butter has 15 servings
* They need enough peanut butter for 30 days

To calculate the total number of servings needed for 30 days:
* Phoebe's servings per day: 1
* Dog's servings per day: 1
* Total servings per day: 1 + 1 = 2
* Total servings needed for 30 days: 2 servings per day x 30 days = 60 servings

Now, to calculate the number of jars needed:
* Each jar has 15 servings
* 60 servings needed / 15 servings per jar = 4 jars

Therefore, Phoebe will need 4 jars of peanut butter to make sure she and her dog have enough for 30 days.
