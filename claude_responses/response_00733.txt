Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Henry collected 11 seashells
* John collected 24 seashells
* The total number of seashells collected initially was 59
* We can calculate the number of seashells Leo collected by subtracting the number collected by Henry and John from the total:
    - Total seashells collected = 59
    - Seashells collected by Henry = 11
    - Seashells collected by John = 24
    - Seashells collected by Leo = 59 - 11 - 24 = 24
* Leo then gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid
    - A quarter of 24 is 24 / 4 = 6
    - So Leo gave away 6 seashells
* The total number of seashells they have now is:
    - Seashells collected by Henry = 11
    - Seashells collected by John = 24
    - Seashells collected by Leo = 24 - 6 = 18
    - Total seashells = 11 + 24 + 18 = 53
