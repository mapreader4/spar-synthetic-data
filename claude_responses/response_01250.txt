Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lucia takes 2 hip-hop classes per week
* Each hip-hop class costs $10
* So the total cost for hip-hop classes per week is 2 * $10 = $20

* Lucia takes 2 ballet classes per week
* Each ballet class costs $12
* So the total cost for ballet classes per week is 2 * $12 = $24

* Lucia takes 1 jazz class per week
* Each jazz class costs $8
* So the total cost for jazz classes per week is 1 * $8 = $8

Now, to find the total cost of Lucia's dance classes in one week, we add up the costs for each type of class:
* Total cost = $20 (hip-hop) + $24 (ballet) + $8 (jazz)
* Total cost = $52

Answer: 52
