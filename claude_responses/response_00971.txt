Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Annabelle's weekly allowance is $30.
2) She spent a third of her allowance on junk food. One-third of $30 is $10, so she spent $10 on junk food.
3) She then spent an additional $8 on sweets.
4) So the total amount she spent is $10 (junk food) + $8 (sweets) = $18.
5) Her remaining allowance is $30 - $18 = $12.
6) Therefore, Annabelle saved $12.

Answer: 12
