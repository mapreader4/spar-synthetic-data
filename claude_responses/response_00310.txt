Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janet has 6 employees total:
   - 4 warehouse workers who make $15/hour
   - 2 managers who make $20/hour
2) Each employee works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day.
3) To calculate the monthly wages for the warehouse workers:
   - 4 workers x $15/hour x 25 days x 8 hours/day = $12,000
4) To calculate the monthly wages for the managers:
   - 2 managers x $20/hour x 25 days x 8 hours/day = $8,000
5) The total monthly wages for all 6 employees is:
   - $12,000 + $8,000 = $20,000
6) Janet has to pay 10% of the total wages in FICA taxes:
   - 10% of $20,000 = $2,000
7) The total amount Janet owes for wages and taxes for one month is:
   - $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000

Answer: 22,000
