Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Robe used $10 from his savings to pay for the car repair.
2) Before the repair, he bought 2 kinds of spare parts:
   a) A corner light that costs twice the price of the repair fee.
   b) Two brake disks, each costing thrice the price of the corner light.
3) After the repair and buying the spare parts, Robe had $480 savings left.

Let's start by finding the cost of the repair fee:
* Repair fee = $10

Now, let's find the cost of the corner light:
* Corner light cost = 2 x $10 = $20

Next, let's find the cost of the brake disks:
* Each brake disk cost = 3 x $20 = $60
* Total cost of 2 brake disks = 2 x $60 = $120

Now, let's calculate the total amount Robe spent:
* Total spent = Repair fee + Corner light + Brake disks
* Total spent = $10 + $20 + $120 = $150

Finally, let's calculate the amount Robe had saved before his car broke:
* Amount saved before car broke = Amount left after spending + Total spent
* Amount saved before car broke = $480 + $150 = $630

Answer: $630
