Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 14 chickens in the coop.
2) There are twice as many chickens in the run as in the coop, so that's 2 * 14 = 28 chickens in the run.
3) The number of chickens free ranging is 4 less than double the number of chickens in the run.
4) Double the number of chickens in the run is 2 * 28 = 56.
5) 56 - 4 = 52 chickens are free ranging.

Answer: 52
