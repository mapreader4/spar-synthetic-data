Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The gardener ordered 250 tulips, 375 carnations, and 320 roses
* Each flower is sold for 2€
* To calculate the total expenses, we need to find the total number of flowers ordered and multiply it by the price per flower

First, let's find the total number of flowers ordered:
* 250 tulips + 375 carnations + 320 roses = 945 total flowers

Now, we can multiply the total number of flowers by the price per flower to get the total expenses:
* 945 flowers x 2€ per flower = 1,890€

Answer: 1,890
