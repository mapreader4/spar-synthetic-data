Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janet makes $20 per hour at work
* She works 52 hours per week
* Anything over 40 hours per week is considered overtime and is paid at 1.5 times the normal rate
* She wants to purchase a $4640 car

First, let's calculate her normal weekly pay:
* 40 hours per week at $20 per hour = $800 per week

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay:
* 12 hours per week at 1.5 times the normal rate = 12 x $20 x 1.5 = $360 per week

Her total weekly pay is the sum of her normal pay and overtime pay:
* $800 + $360 = $1,160 per week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save up $4,640 for the car:
* $4,640 / $1,160 per week = 4 weeks

Answer: 4 weeks
