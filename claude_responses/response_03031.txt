Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Tall Tuna has twice as many fish as Jerk Tuna
* Jerk Tuna has 144 fish
* To find the number of fish Tall Tuna has, we multiply Jerk Tuna's fish by 2:
* 144 x 2 = 288 fish
* Now, to find the total number of fish they have together, we add Jerk Tuna's fish and Tall Tuna's fish:
* 144 + 288 = 432 fish

Answer: 432
