Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Daria consumes 2.5 times the amount of pizza that Don does
* Don eats 80 pizzas
* To find the total number of pizzas they both eat, we need to find how many pizzas Daria eats and add it to the number of pizzas Don eats

First, let's find how many pizzas Daria eats:
* Daria consumes 2.5 times the amount of pizza that Don does
* So, if Don eats 80 pizzas, Daria eats 2.5 * 80 = 200 pizzas

Now, to find the total number of pizzas they both eat:
* Don eats 80 pizzas
* Daria eats 200 pizzas
* So, the total number of pizzas they both eat is 80 + 200 = 280 pizzas

Answer: 280
