Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of guests: 60
* Half of the guests are women, so the number of women is 60 / 2 = 30
* The number of men is 15
* The number of children is the remaining guests, which is 60 - 30 - 15 = 15
* During the celebration, 1/3 of the men left, which is 15 * 1/3 = 5 men
* Also, 5 children left
* So the number of people who stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration is:
  - Women: 30
  - Men: 15 - 5 = 10
  - Children: 15 - 5 = 10
* Total number of people who stayed: 30 + 10 + 10 = 50

Answer: 50
