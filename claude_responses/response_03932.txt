Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Susie can vacuum the whole house in 2 hours
* Each room takes her 20 minutes to vacuum
* To find the number of rooms, we need to determine how many 20-minute intervals are in 2 hours
* 2 hours = 120 minutes
* 120 minutes / 20 minutes per room = 6 rooms
* Therefore, Susie has 6 rooms in her house.
