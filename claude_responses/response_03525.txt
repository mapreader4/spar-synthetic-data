Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jason has two tattoos on each of his arms, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 tattoos on his arms.
2) Jason also has three tattoos on each of his legs, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 tattoos on his legs.
3) In total, Jason has 4 + 6 = 10 tattoos.
4) Adam has three more than twice as many tattoos as Jason, so we can calculate this as:
   - Twice as many as Jason: 2 x 10 = 20
   - Three more than that: 20 + 3 = 23
Therefore, Adam has 23 tattoos.

Answer: 23
