Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 25% of oysters have pearls in them
* Jamie can collect 16 oysters during each dive
* We need to find how many dives Jamie needs to make to collect 56 pearls

First, let's calculate how many pearls Jamie can collect per dive:
* 25% of 16 oysters = 0.25 * 16 = 4 pearls per dive

Now, we can calculate how many dives Jamie needs to make to collect 56 pearls:
* 56 pearls / 4 pearls per dive = 14 dives

Answer: 14 dives
