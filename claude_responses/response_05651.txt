Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nathan bought one large box of bananas
* There are six bunches with eight bananas in each bunch
* So, for the six bunches with eight bananas each, the total number of bananas is:
  * 6 bunches x 8 bananas per bunch = 48 bananas
* There are also five bunches with seven bananas in each bunch
* So, for the five bunches with seven bananas each, the total number of bananas is:
  * 5 bunches x 7 bananas per bunch = 35 bananas
* To get the total number of bananas, we add the two amounts together:
  * 48 bananas + 35 bananas = 83 bananas

Answer: 83
