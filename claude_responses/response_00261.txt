Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price
* You bought 36 fruits, evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons
* That means you bought 12 of each fruit
* The price of 1 orange is $0.50
* The total bill was $66

First, let's calculate the cost of the oranges:
* 12 oranges x $0.50 = $6

Now, we know that the cost of 4 apples or 1 watermelon is the same. Let's call this cost 'x'.
* 12 apples = 3x
* 12 watermelons = 12x
* Total cost of apples and watermelons = 3x + 12x = 15x

The total bill was $66, so:
* Total cost = Cost of oranges + Cost of apples and watermelons
* $66 = $6 + 15x
* 15x = $60
* x = $4

Therefore, the cost of 1 apple is $4.

Answer: $4
