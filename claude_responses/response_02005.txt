Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew
* She then sold 18 cups to kids on bikes
* She gave away half the amount she sold to the kids on bikes to her friends
* She drank the last cup of lemonade herself

First, let's calculate how many cups she sold to the construction crew. If she sold half her lemonade to them, and she sold 18 cups to the kids on bikes, then she must have made 36 cups of lemonade total (18 cups x 2 = 36 cups).

Next, she gave away half the amount she sold to the kids on bikes to her friends. So she gave away 9 cups (18 cups / 2 = 9 cups).

Finally, she drank the last cup herself.

So the total number of cups of lemonade Hazel made is:
* 36 cups (total) - 18 cups (sold to kids on bikes) - 9 cups (given to friends) - 1 cup (she drank) = 8 cups

Answer: 8
