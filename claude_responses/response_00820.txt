Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total bill for the two meals is $16 + $14 = $30.
2) James' friend pays for half the bill, which is $30 / 2 = $15.
3) James pays the other half of the bill, which is also $15.
4) The tip is 20% of the total bill, which is 0.20 * $30 = $6.
5) James pays the tip in addition to his half of the bill.
6) Therefore, the total amount James paid is $15 + $6 = $21.

Answer: $21
