Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carol has $60 and saves $9 per week
* Mike has $90 and saves $3 per week
* We need to find how many weeks it will take for Carol and Mike to have the same amount of money

First, let's calculate how much money Carol and Mike will have after each week:
* After 1 week, Carol will have $60 + $9 = $69
* After 1 week, Mike will have $90 + $3 = $93

Now, let's calculate the difference between their amounts:
* After 1 week, the difference is $93 - $69 = $24

To find how many weeks it will take for the difference to be $0 (i.e. for them to have the same amount), we can divide the initial difference ($90 - $60 = $30) by the difference in their weekly savings ($9 - $3 = $6).

$30 / $6 = 5 weeks

Therefore, it will take 5 weeks for Carol and Mike to both have the same amount of money.
