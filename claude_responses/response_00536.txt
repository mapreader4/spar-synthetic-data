Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 7 people voted for the witch cake
* The number of votes for the dragon cake was 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake
* So, the number of votes for the dragon cake was 7 + 25 = 32
* The number of votes for the unicorn cake was three times the number of votes for the witch cake
* So, the number of votes for the unicorn cake was 7 x 3 = 21

Now, to find the total number of votes cast, we add up the votes for each cake:
* Witch cake: 7 votes
* Dragon cake: 32 votes
* Unicorn cake: 21 votes
* Total votes = 7 + 32 + 21 = 60

Answer: 60
