Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Each guest will eat 5 hushpuppies
* Walter is having 20 guests
* So the total number of hushpuppies needed is:
  * 20 guests x 5 hushpuppies per guest = 100 hushpuppies
* Walter can cook 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes
* To calculate the time it will take to cook all 100 hushpuppies, we need to find how many batches of 10 hushpuppies need to be cooked
* 100 hushpuppies / 10 hushpuppies per batch = 10 batches
* Each batch takes 8 minutes to cook
* So the total time to cook all 100 hushpuppies is:
  * 10 batches x 8 minutes per batch = 80 minutes

Answer: 80 minutes
