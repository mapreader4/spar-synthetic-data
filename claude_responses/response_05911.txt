Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The building has 20 floors.
2) Each floor is 3 meters high, except for the last two floors.
3) The last two floors are each 0.5 meters higher than the other floors.
4) To calculate the total height of the building, we need to:
   a) Calculate the height of the first 18 floors, which are each 3 meters high.
      - 18 floors x 3 meters per floor = 54 meters
   b) Calculate the height of the last two floors, which are each 3.5 meters high.
      - 2 floors x 3.5 meters per floor = 7 meters
   c) Add the height of the first 18 floors and the last two floors.
      - 54 meters + 7 meters = 61 meters

Answer: 61 meters
