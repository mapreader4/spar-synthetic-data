Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Randy drew 5 pictures
* Peter drew 3 more pictures than Randy
* So, Peter drew 5 + 3 = 8 pictures
* Quincy drew 20 more pictures than Peter
* So, Quincy drew 8 + 20 = 28 pictures

Now, to find the total number of pictures drawn, we add up the pictures drawn by each person:
* Randy: 5 pictures
* Peter: 8 pictures
* Quincy: 28 pictures
* Total: 5 + 8 + 28 = 41 pictures

Answer: 41
