Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lucy can jump the rope 1 time per second
* Each song on the album is 3.5 minutes long
* There are 10 songs on the album

First, we need to calculate the total duration of the album:
* 10 songs x 3.5 minutes per song = 35 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total duration from minutes to seconds:
* 35 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 2,100 seconds

Since Lucy can jump the rope 1 time per second, the number of times she will jump rope is equal to the total number of seconds in the album:
* 2,100 seconds

Answer: 2,100
