Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alice is given $2000 to invest
* Alice puts all of her money in the stock market and doubles her money
* So, Alice's final amount is $2000 x 2 = $4000
* Bob is given $2000 to invest
* Bob invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested
* So, Bob's final amount is $2000 x 5 = $10,000
* To find how much more money Bob has than Alice, we subtract Alice's final amount from Bob's final amount:
* $10,000 - $4,000 = $6,000

Answer: $6,000
