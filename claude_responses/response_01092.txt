Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Estevan has 24 blankets in total.
2) One-third of the 24 blankets have polka-dots. To find one-third of 24, we can divide 24 by 3: 24 รท 3 = 8.
3) So Estevan originally had 8 polka-dot blankets.
4) For his birthday, his mother gives him 2 more polka-dot blankets.
5) So the total number of polka-dot blankets Estevan has is 8 + 2 = 10.
