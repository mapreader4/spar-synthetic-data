Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The tub has a capacity of 120 liters
* The tap has a flow rate of 12 liters per minute
* The cap at the bottom of the tub lets 1 liter of water escape per minute
* Robi Ney alternates between letting the water run for 1 minute and then closing the water supply for 1 minute

In the first minute, the water runs and 12 liters are added to the tub. However, 1 liter also escapes, so the net gain is 11 liters.
In the second minute, the water is turned off, so no water is added, but 1 liter still escapes, resulting in a net loss of 1 liter.

This pattern of 1 minute on, 1 minute off, continues. 
In the on minutes, 11 liters are added.
In the off minutes, 1 liter is lost.

To fill the 120-liter tub, we need to add 120 liters of water. 
In each 2-minute cycle (1 minute on, 1 minute off), the net gain is 10 liters (11 liters added, 1 liter lost).

Therefore, the number of 2-minute cycles required to fill the 120-liter tub is:
120 liters / 10 liters per cycle = 12 cycles

Each cycle takes 2 minutes, so the total time to fill the tub is:
12 cycles x 2 minutes/cycle = 24 minutes

Answer: 24 minutes
