Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Neighborhood A:
- There are 10 homes in Neighborhood A
- Each home in Neighborhood A will buy 2 boxes of cookies
- So, the total number of boxes of cookies sold in Neighborhood A is:
  - 10 homes x 2 boxes per home = 20 boxes

Neighborhood B:
- There are 5 homes in Neighborhood B
- Each home in Neighborhood B will buy 5 boxes of cookies
- So, the total number of boxes of cookies sold in Neighborhood B is:
  - 5 homes x 5 boxes per home = 25 boxes

Now, we need to calculate the total revenue Jenny will make at each neighborhood:
- Each box of cookies costs $2
- Neighborhood A revenue: 20 boxes x $2 per box = $40
- Neighborhood B revenue: 25 boxes x $2 per box = $50

Since Neighborhood B has a higher total revenue, that is the better choice for Jenny.

Answer: $50
