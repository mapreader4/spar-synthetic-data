Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miss Aisha's legs are 1/3 of her total height
* Her head is 1/4 of her total height
* She is 60 inches tall

First, let's calculate the length of her legs:
* If her legs are 1/3 of her total height, then her legs are 1/3 * 60 inches = 20 inches

Next, let's calculate the length of her head:
* If her head is 1/4 of her total height, then her head is 1/4 * 60 inches = 15 inches

Finally, to calculate the length of the rest of her body, we need to subtract the length of her legs and head from her total height:
* Rest of her body = 60 inches - 20 inches - 15 inches = 25 inches

Answer: 25 inches
