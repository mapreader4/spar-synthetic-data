Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The store has 63 black shirts and 42 white shirts, so the total number of shirts is 63 + 42 = 105.
2. The number of jeans is two-thirds of the total number of shirts, so the number of jeans is (2/3) * 105 = 70.
3. The store has 34 ties and 40 belts, so the sum of ties and belts is 34 + 40 = 74.
4. The number of scarves is half the sum of ties and belts, so the number of scarves is (1/2) * 74 = 37.
5. The number of jeans (70) minus the number of scarves (37) is 70 - 37 = 33.
