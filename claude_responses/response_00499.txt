Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Salvadore earned $1956.
2) Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned.
3) To find how much Santo earned, we take Salvadore's earnings ($1956) and divide it by 2.
4) $1956 / 2 = $978
5) So Santo earned $978.
6) To find the total amount of money the two men earned together, we add Salvadore's earnings ($1956) and Santo's earnings ($978).
7) $1956 + $978 = $2934.

Answer: 2934
