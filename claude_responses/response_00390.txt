Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Oscar wants to train for a marathon
* He plans to add 2/3 of a mile each week until he reaches a 20-mile run
* He has already run 2 miles

To find out how many weeks before the marathon he should start training, we need to calculate how many weeks it will take him to reach the 20-mile run.

We know that he adds 2/3 of a mile each week, and he has already run 2 miles. So, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take him to reach the 20-mile run:
* 20 miles - 2 miles = 18 miles
* 18 miles / (2/3 miles per week) = 27 weeks

Therefore, Oscar should start training 27 weeks before the marathon.

Answer: 27
