Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Trey has 5 times as many turtles as Kris.
2) Kris has one fourth the turtles that Kristen has.
3) Kristen has 12 turtles.
4) Since Kris has one fourth the turtles that Kristen has, Kris has 12 / 4 = 3 turtles.
5) Since Trey has 5 times as many turtles as Kris, Trey has 5 * 3 = 15 turtles.
6) Adding up the turtles of Kristen, Kris, and Trey, we get 12 + 3 + 15 = 30 turtles altogether.

Answer: 30
