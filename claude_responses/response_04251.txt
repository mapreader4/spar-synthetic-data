Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first week, Carly runs 2 miles per week.

2. In the second week, Carly runs twice as long as the first week, plus an additional 3 miles. 
   * 2 x 2 miles = 4 miles
   * 4 miles + 3 miles = 7 miles

3. In the third week, Carly runs 9/7 as much as she ran in the second week.
   * 9/7 x 7 miles = 9 miles

4. In the fourth week, Carly has to reduce her running time by 5 miles per week due to her sprained ankle.
   * 9 miles - 5 miles = 4 miles

Therefore, the week Carly was injured, she ran 4 miles.
