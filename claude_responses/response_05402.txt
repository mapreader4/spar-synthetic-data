Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The plane takes off from New York City at 6:00 a.m.
* The plane flies for 4 hours to Chicago
* The plane stays at the port in Chicago for 1 hour
* The plane then departs for Miami
* The plane took three times as many hours to fly to Miami than it took to fly from New York to Chicago

First, let's calculate the time it took to fly from New York to Chicago:
* The plane took 4 hours to fly from New York to Chicago

Next, let's calculate the time it took to fly from Chicago to Miami:
* The plane took three times as many hours to fly to Miami than it took to fly from New York to Chicago
* So, the plane took 3 x 4 = 12 hours to fly from Chicago to Miami

Now, let's calculate the total time to travel from New York to Miami:
* The plane took 4 hours to fly from New York to Chicago
* The plane stayed at the port in Chicago for 1 hour
* The plane took 12 hours to fly from Chicago to Miami
* Total time = 4 + 1 + 12 = 17 hours
