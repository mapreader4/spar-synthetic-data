Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chelsea made 4 batches of cupcakes
* Each batch took 20 minutes to bake
* Each batch took 30 minutes to ice
* To calculate the total time:
* Baking time: 4 batches x 20 minutes = 80 minutes
* Icing time: 4 batches x 30 minutes = 120 minutes
* Total time = Baking time + Icing time
* Total time = 80 minutes + 120 minutes = 200 minutes

Answer: 200
