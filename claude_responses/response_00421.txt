Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Wilsborough saved $500 to buy concert tickets
* She bought:
  - 2 VIP tickets at $100 each
  - 3 regular tickets at $50 each
* To calculate the total cost of the tickets:
  - 2 VIP tickets at $100 each = 2 x $100 = $200
  - 3 regular tickets at $50 each = 3 x $50 = $150
  - Total cost of tickets = $200 + $150 = $350
* Now, to calculate how much of her savings Mrs. Wilsborough has left:
  - She saved $500
  - She spent $350 on the tickets
  - $500 - $350 = $150

Answer: 150
