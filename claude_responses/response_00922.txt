Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cadence worked for her old company for 3 years, which is 36 months.
2) She worked for her new company 5 months longer than her old company, so that's 36 + 5 = 41 months.
3) At her old company, she earned $5000 per month.
4) So her total earnings at her old company were 36 months * $5000 per month = $180,000.
5) At her new company, she's earning 20% more than her old company, so her new salary is $5000 * 1.2 = $6000 per month.
6) Her total earnings at her new company were 41 months * $6000 per month = $246,000.
7) The total amount of money she's earned in both companies is $180,000 + $246,000 = $426,000.

Answer: 426,000
