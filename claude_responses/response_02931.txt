Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The class has 500 tables
* The number of books on top of each table is 2/5 times the number of tables
* To find the total number of books, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of books per table

First, let's find the number of books per table:
* 2/5 times the number of tables = 2/5 * 500 = 200 books per table

Now, to find the total number of books, we multiply the number of tables by the number of books per table:
* 500 tables * 200 books per table = 100,000 books

Answer: 100,000
