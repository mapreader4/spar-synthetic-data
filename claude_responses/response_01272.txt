Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ruiz's current monthly salary is $500.
2) He received a 6% raise.
3) To calculate the new salary, we need to find 6% of the current salary and add it to the current salary.
4) 6% of $500 is 0.06 x $500 = $30.
5) Ruiz's new salary will be the current salary ($500) plus the raise ($30).
6) $500 + $30 = $530.

Answer: $530.
