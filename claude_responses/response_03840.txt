Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Fred has 38 red marbles.
2) He has half as many green marbles as red marbles. So, the number of green marbles is 38 / 2 = 19.
3) The total number of marbles is 63.
4) We can calculate the number of dark blue marbles by subtracting the number of red and green marbles from the total number of marbles:
   Total marbles = 63
   Red marbles = 38
   Green marbles = 19
   Dark blue marbles = 63 - 38 - 19 = 6

Answer: 6
