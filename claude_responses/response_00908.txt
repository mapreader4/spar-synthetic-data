Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. For the first 12 hours, John generates $5000 per hour.
   * Total for the first 12 hours = $5000 x 12 hours = $60,000

2. For the remaining 14 hours, he generates 20% more per hour.
   * 20% more than $5000 per hour is $6000 per hour.
   * Total for the remaining 14 hours = $6000 x 14 hours = $84,000

3. To calculate the total money he makes, we add the two amounts together:
   * Total money = $60,000 + $84,000 = $144,000

Answer: 144,000
