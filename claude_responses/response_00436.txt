Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens, so if she had 60 pens, she must have had 60 pencils as well.
2) She gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends.
3) For each friend, she gave away 8 pens and 6 pencils, so that's 14 items per friend.
4) With 7 friends, she gave away a total of 7 * 14 = 98 items.
5) Since she had an equal number of pens and pencils, she gave away 49 pens and 49 pencils.
6) She started with 60 pens and 60 pencils, so after giving away 49 of each, she had 60 - 49 = 11 pens and 60 - 49 = 11 pencils left.

Answer: 11 pens and 11 pencils.
