Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jury selection takes 2 days
* The trial itself lasts 4 times as long as jury selection
* So the trial lasts 4 x 2 = 8 days
* The number of hours spent in jury deliberation was the equivalent of 6 full days
* They spend 16 hours a day in deliberation
* So the number of hours spent in deliberation is 6 x 16 = 96 hours
* To find the number of days, we divide the total hours of deliberation by the number of hours per day:
* 96 hours / 16 hours per day = 6 days

Therefore, the total number of days John spends on jury duty is:
* Jury selection: 2 days
* Trial: 8 days
* Deliberation: 6 days
* Total: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 days

Answer: 16 days
