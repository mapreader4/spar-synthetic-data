Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The group had 150 members before the admin removed 20 members
* After the removal, the remaining number of members is 150 - 20 = 130 members
* Each member posted 50 messages per day
* We need to calculate the total number of messages the remaining 130 members would send in a week

To calculate the total number of messages in a week:
* Number of messages per day per member = 50
* Number of remaining members = 130
* Number of days in a week = 7
* Total number of messages in a week = 50 messages/day x 130 members x 7 days = 45,500 messages

Answer: 45,500
