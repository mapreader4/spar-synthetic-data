Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eric has 4 chickens on his farm
* Each chicken lays 3 eggs per day
* We want to know how many eggs Eric will have collected after 3 days

To calculate the total number of eggs collected, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of eggs laid per day
2. Multiply the number of eggs laid per day by the number of days

Step 1: Calculating the number of eggs laid per day
* Each chicken lays 3 eggs per day
* There are 4 chickens on the farm
* So, the total number of eggs laid per day is 4 chickens x 3 eggs per chicken = 12 eggs per day

Step 2: Calculating the total number of eggs collected after 3 days
* The chickens lay 12 eggs per day
* After 3 days, the total number of eggs collected is 12 eggs per day x 3 days = 36 eggs

Answer: 36
