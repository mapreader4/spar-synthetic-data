Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mike buys 6 rose bushes at $75 each.
2) 2 of the rose bushes are for his friend, so the remaining 4 rose bushes are for himself.
3) The cost of the 4 rose bushes for himself is:
   4 rose bushes x $75 per bush = $300
4) Mike also buys 2 tiger tooth aloes at $100 each.
5) The cost of the 2 tiger tooth aloes is:
   2 aloes x $100 per aloe = $200
6) The total amount Mike spent on plants for himself is the sum of the rose bushes and the aloes:
   $300 + $200 = $500

Answer: $500
