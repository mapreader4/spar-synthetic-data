Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lauren makes $0.50 for every commercial that's viewed
* On Tuesday, 100 people watched commercials before viewing her content
* So, for the commercials, she made:
  * 100 people x $0.50 per commercial = $50
* Lauren also makes $1.00 for every person who subscribes
* On Tuesday, 27 people subscribed
* So, for the subscriptions, she made:
  * 27 people x $1.00 per subscription = $27
* To calculate the total amount of money she made, we add the amounts from the commercials and subscriptions:
  * $50 + $27 = $77

Answer: $77
