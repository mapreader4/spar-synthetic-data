Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anne has 12 markers
* Each marker lasts for about 1.5 drawings
* She has already made 8 drawings

To find out how many more drawings she can make, we need to calculate the total number of drawings she can make with her 12 markers, and then subtract the 8 drawings she has already made.

First, let's calculate the total number of drawings she can make with her 12 markers:
* Each marker lasts for 1.5 drawings
* 12 markers x 1.5 drawings per marker = 18 total drawings

Now, we subtract the 8 drawings she has already made:
* 18 total drawings - 8 drawings already made = 10 more drawings

Answer: 10
