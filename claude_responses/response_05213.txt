Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jon can initially throw a fastball at 80 miles per hour (mph)
* He goes through intense training 4 times, each for 4 weeks
* At the end of the last training session, he can throw a ball 20% faster
* We need to find the speed gain per week, assuming an equal amount of speed gained each week

First, let's calculate the total speed gain:
* Initial speed: 80 mph
* Final speed: 80 mph + (80 mph * 0.20) = 96 mph
* Total speed gain: 96 mph - 80 mph = 16 mph

Now, to find the speed gain per week, we divide the total speed gain by the total number of weeks:
* Total number of weeks: 4 weeks * 4 sessions = 16 weeks
* Speed gain per week: 16 mph / 16 weeks = 1 mph per week

Therefore, the speed gain per week is:
Answer: 1 mph
