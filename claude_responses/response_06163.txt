Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.
2) However, the problem states that the sum of the three angles is 250 degrees.
3) The left angle is twice the right angle's value, and the right angle is 60 degrees.
4) So, the left angle is 2 * 60 = 120 degrees.
5) The right angle is 60 degrees.
6) The top angle is the remaining angle, so it must be 250 - 120 - 60 = 70 degrees.

Answer: 70
