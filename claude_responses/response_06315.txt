Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack slashed 3 tires
* Each tire costs $250
* So the cost of the 3 tires is:
3 x $250 = $750
* Jack also smashed the front window
* The window costs $700
* To calculate the total cost of the damages, we add the cost of the tires and the window:
$750 + $700 = $1,450
Answer: $1,450
