Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were three 5-minute commercials
* Each of these 5-minute commercials takes 5 minutes
* So the total time for the three 5-minute commercials is 3 x 5 = 15 minutes
* There were eleven 2-minute commercials
* Each of these 2-minute commercials takes 2 minutes
* So the total time for the eleven 2-minute commercials is 11 x 2 = 22 minutes
* To find the total time of the commercial break, we add the time for the 5-minute commercials and the 2-minute commercials:
* 15 minutes + 22 minutes = 37 minutes

Answer: 37
