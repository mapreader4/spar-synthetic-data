Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Connor wants to order some new books
* The website offers free shipping over $50.00
* When you buy 4 books, the first two are 25% off
* Book 1 costs $13.00
* Book 2 costs $15.00
* Book 3 and Book 4 both cost $10.00 each

First, let's calculate the cost of the first two books with the 25% discount:
* Book 1 original price: $13.00
* Book 1 discounted price: $13.00 * (1 - 0.25) = $9.75
* Book 2 original price: $15.00
* Book 2 discounted price: $15.00 * (1 - 0.25) = $11.25

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all 4 books:
* Book 1 discounted price: $9.75
* Book 2 discounted price: $11.25
* Book 3 price: $10.00
* Book 4 price: $10.00
* Total cost: $9.75 + $11.25 + $10.00 + $10.00 = $41.00

The website offers free shipping over $50.00, so Connor needs to spend $9.00 more to reach the free shipping threshold.

Answer: $9
