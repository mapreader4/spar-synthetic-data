Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pebbles make a splash that is 1/4 meter wide
* TreQuan tosses 6 pebbles
* So the total width of the splashes from the pebbles is:
    6 pebbles x 1/4 meter = 1.5 meters
* Rocks make a splash that is 1/2 a meter wide
* TreQuan tosses 3 rocks
* So the total width of the splashes from the rocks is:
    3 rocks x 1/2 meter = 1.5 meters
* Boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide
* TreQuan tosses 2 boulders
* So the total width of the splashes from the boulders is:
    2 boulders x 2 meters = 4 meters
* To get the total width of all the splashes, we add up the widths from the pebbles, rocks, and boulders:
    1.5 meters + 1.5 meters + 4 meters = 7 meters
