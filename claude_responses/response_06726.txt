Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* The poem currently contains 24 lines.
* The person adds 3 lines to the poem every month.
* We need to find how many months it will take for the poem to contain 90 lines.

To do this, we need to find how many lines need to be added to the poem to reach 90 lines.
* The poem currently has 24 lines.
* We need to add 90 - 24 = 66 lines to reach 90 lines.

Now, we need to find how many months it will take to add 66 lines, given that 3 lines are added per month.
* 66 lines / 3 lines per month = 22 months.

Answer: 22 months.
