Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Josh had 100 gummy bear candies to start with.
2) He gave his 3 siblings 10 candies each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 candies given away.
3) Now he has 100 - 30 = 70 candies remaining.
4) He then gave half of the remaining candies to his best friend. Half of 70 is 35, so he gave away 35 candies.
5) Now he has 70 - 35 = 35 candies remaining.
6) He wants to eat 16 candies himself.
7) So the number of candies left to be shared with others is 35 - 16 = 19 candies.

Answer: 19
