Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Candy baked 4 trays of cookies
* Each tray had 24 cookies
* So the total number of cookies baked is:
  * 4 trays x 24 cookies per tray = 96 cookies
* Candy then divided the 96 cookies equally into 8 packs
* To find the number of cookies in each pack, we divide the total number of cookies (96) by the number of packs (8):
  * 96 cookies / 8 packs = 12 cookies per pack

Answer: 12
