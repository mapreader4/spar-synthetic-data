Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James works for 240 minutes
* He takes a water break every 20 minutes
* He takes a sitting break every 120 minutes

To find the number of water breaks:
* 240 minutes / 20 minutes per water break = 12 water breaks

To find the number of sitting breaks:
* 240 minutes / 120 minutes per sitting break = 2 sitting breaks

Now, to find the difference between the number of water breaks and sitting breaks:
* 12 water breaks - 2 sitting breaks = 10 more water breaks than sitting breaks

Answer: 10
