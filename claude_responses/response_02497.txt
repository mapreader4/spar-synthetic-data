Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tim won a $100 raffle.
2) He gave away 20% of the $100 to his friend.
3) To calculate 20% of $100, we can multiply $100 by 0.20 (since 20% is equivalent to 0.20):
$100 x 0.20 = $20
4) So Tim gave away $20 to his friend.
5) To calculate how much Tim kept, we take the original $100 and subtract the $20 he gave away:
$100 - $20 = $80
Answer: $80
