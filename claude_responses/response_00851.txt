Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jane ends up with 60 points
* She lost 20 points
* So, her initial score was 60 + 20 = 80 points
* Each round she won was worth 10 points
* Therefore, the number of rounds she played is her initial score divided by the points per round
* 80 points / 10 points per round = 8 rounds

Answer: 8
