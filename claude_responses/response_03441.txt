Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brandon sold the geckos to the pet shop for $100.
2) The pet shop sells the geckos for 5 more than 3 times the amount Brandon sold them for.
3) To calculate the pet shop's selling price, we take 3 times $100, which is $300, and then add $5, which gives us $305.
4) To calculate the pet shop's profit, we take the selling price ($305) and subtract the amount they paid Brandon ($100).
5) $305 - $100 = $205.

Answer: $205
