Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Paul had a total of 80 chickens to sell at the market
* Before leaving the farm, he sold 12 chickens to his neighbor
* So, the number of chickens he had left before going to the market was 80 - 12 = 68 chickens
* At the gate, before the market opened, he sold another 25 chickens to a quick customer
* So, the number of chickens he was left with to sell at the market was 68 - 25 = 43 chickens

Answer: 43
