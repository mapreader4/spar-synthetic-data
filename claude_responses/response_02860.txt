Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Mitchell bought 6 pizzas
* Each pizza has 12 slices
* So the total number of slices is 6 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = 72 slices
* The team had 8 games
* Mr. Mitchell bought one slice for every goal they scored on the season
* To find the average number of goals scored per game, we need to divide the total number of goals scored by the number of games played
* So the total number of goals scored is 72 (the number of slices)
* Dividing 72 by 8 games gives us 9 goals per game on average.

Answer: 9
