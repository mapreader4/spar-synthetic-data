Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gertrude the chicken has 10 fleas
* Maud has 5 times the amount of fleas as Olive
* Olive has half the amount of fleas as Gertrude

First, let's find out how many fleas Olive has:
* Olive has half the amount of fleas as Gertrude
* Gertrude has 10 fleas
* Therefore, Olive has 10 / 2 = 5 fleas

Now, let's find out how many fleas Maud has:
* Maud has 5 times the amount of fleas as Olive
* Olive has 5 fleas
* Therefore, Maud has 5 * 5 = 25 fleas

Finally, we can add up the total number of fleas:
* Gertrude has 10 fleas
* Olive has 5 fleas
* Maud has 25 fleas
* Total fleas = 10 + 5 + 25 = 40

Answer: 40
