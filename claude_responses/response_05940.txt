Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Erica takes 1/5 of an apple pie.
2) Erica also takes 3/4 of a cherry pie.
3) To find the total fraction of a whole pie that Erica took, we need to add the fractions of the two pies together.
4) 1/5 of an apple pie + 3/4 of a cherry pie = 1/5 + 3/4 = 15/20 + 15/20 = 30/20 = 3/2 = 1.5 whole pies.
5) To express this as a percentage, we divide 1.5 by 1 (the total number of whole pies) and multiply by 100.
6) 1.5 / 1 = 1.5
7) 1.5 * 100 = 150%

Answer: 150%
