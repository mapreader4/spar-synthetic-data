Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) You have some number of marbles, let's call this number x.
2) If you give your brother 2 marbles, you will have double his number of marbles. So, your brother has (x-2)/2 marbles.
3) Your friend has triple the number of marbles you have, so your friend has 3x marbles.
4) The total number of marbles you all have together is 63, so we can write the equation:
x + (x-2)/2 + 3x = 63
5) Simplifying this equation, we get:
4.5x - 1 = 63
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = 14
Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 14
