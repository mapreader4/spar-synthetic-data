Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mr. Banks has 8 investment streams, and each one generates $500 in revenue.
   * Total revenue for Mr. Banks = 8 x $500 = $4,000

2. Ms. Elizabeth has 5 investment streams, and each one generates $900 in revenue.
   * Total revenue for Ms. Elizabeth = 5 x $900 = $4,500

3. To find the difference in revenue between Ms. Elizabeth and Mr. Banks, we subtract Mr. Banks' revenue from Ms. Elizabeth's revenue.
   * Difference in revenue = Ms. Elizabeth's revenue - Mr. Banks' revenue
   * Difference in revenue = $4,500 - $4,000 = $500

Answer: $500
