Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The area can hold the equivalent of 6 feet of rain
* It can drain out the equivalent of 3 inches of rain per day to the nearby river without causing problems
* On the first day, it rained 10 inches
* On the second day, it rained twice as much as the first day, which is 20 inches
* On the third day, it rained 50% more than the second day, which is 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 inches
* The total amount of rain collected in the first 3 days is:
  - Day 1: 10 inches
  - Day 2: 20 inches
  - Day 3: 30 inches
  - Total: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 inches
* The area can drain 3 inches per day, so in the first 3 days it can drain 3 * 3 = 9 inches
* The remaining amount of rain in the area is 60 - 9 = 51 inches
* The area can hold 6 feet, which is 72 inches
* So the area can hold 72 - 51 = 21 inches more before it overflows
* Therefore, the minimum amount it rained on the fourth day is 21 + 1 = 22 inches (since the area overflowed on the fourth day).

Answer: 22 inches
