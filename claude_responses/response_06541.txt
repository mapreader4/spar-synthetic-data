Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The park had 200 visitors last Saturday.
2) On Sunday, the park had 40 more visitors than on Saturday.
3) To find the number of visitors on Sunday, we add 40 to the number of visitors on Saturday:
   200 + 40 = 240 visitors on Sunday.
4) To find the total number of people in the park over the two days, we add the number of visitors on Saturday and Sunday:
   200 + 240 = 440 visitors total.

Answer: 440
