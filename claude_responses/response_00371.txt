Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session on his new grill.
2) He needs to cook 115 hamburgers in total for tonight's party.
3) He has already cooked 40 hamburgers.
4) To calculate how many more hamburgers he needs to cook, we take the total of 115 and subtract the 40 he has already cooked:
115 - 40 = 75 more hamburgers to cook.
5) Since Ronald can cook 15 hamburgers per session, we can divide the remaining 75 hamburgers by 15 to determine how many more sessions he needs:
75 / 15 = 5 more sessions.

Answer: 5
