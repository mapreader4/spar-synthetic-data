Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that the number of red grapes is 7 more than 3 times the number of green grapes. Let's call the number of green grapes 'x'. Then the number of red grapes is 3x + 7.
2) We also know that the number of raspberries is 5 less than the number of green grapes. So the number of raspberries is x - 5.
3) The total number of pieces of fruit in the salad is 102. We can set up an equation to represent this:
x + (3x + 7) + (x - 5) = 102
4) Simplifying this equation, we get:
5x + 2 = 102
5) Solving for x, we get:
5x = 100
x = 20
6) Therefore, the number of red grapes is 3(20) + 7 = 67.

Answer: 67
