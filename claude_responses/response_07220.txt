Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Donny saved $15
* On Tuesday, Donny saved $28
* On Wednesday, Donny saved $13
* So, the total amount Donny saved over the first three days is:
    - $15 + $28 + $13 = $56
* On Thursday, Donny spent half of his total savings so far
* To find half of $56, we divide $56 by 2:
    - $56 / 2 = $28

Answer: $28
