Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The charity organization's goal is to distribute 400 boxes of food to a community
* Each box contains $80 worth of food and $165 worth of additional supplies
* So the total cost per box is $80 + $165 = $245
* To calculate the total amount spent on the 400 boxes, we multiply the cost per box by the number of boxes:
    * Total cost = $245 x 400 = $98,000
* Then, an anonymous donor gives the organization 4 times the amount of money they had already spent
* This means the organization now has 4 x $98,000 = $392,000 to spend on additional boxes
* To calculate the total number of boxes they can pack with the additional funds, we divide the total funds by the cost per box:
    * Additional boxes = $392,000 / $245 = 1,600 boxes
* Therefore, the total number of boxes they pack is the original 400 boxes plus the additional 1,600 boxes, for a total of:
    * 400 + 1,600 = 2,000 boxes

Answer: 2,000
