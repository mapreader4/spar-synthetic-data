Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Damien jogs 5 miles per day on weekdays only
* There are 5 weekdays in a week
* So in one week, Damien jogs 5 miles x 5 days = 25 miles
* There are 3 weeks in the problem statement
* Therefore, over three weeks, Damien will jog a total of 25 miles x 3 weeks = 75 miles

Answer: 75
