Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matthias has 40 soccer balls and 15 basketballs
* 30 soccer balls have a hole in them
* 7 basketballs have a hole in them
* To find the total number of balls without holes, we need to subtract the number of balls with holes from the total number of balls

First, let's calculate the number of balls with holes:
* 30 soccer balls with holes
* 7 basketballs with holes
* Total balls with holes = 30 + 7 = 37

Now, let's calculate the total number of balls:
* 40 soccer balls
* 15 basketballs
* Total balls = 40 + 15 = 55

Finally, we can subtract the number of balls with holes from the total number of balls to get the number of balls without holes:
* 55 total balls - 37 balls with holes = 18 balls without holes

Answer: 18
