Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Mrs. Brown paid her utility bills with 3 $50 bills and 2 $10 bills
* To calculate the total amount she paid, we need to add up the values of the bills:
* 3 $50 bills = 3 x $50 = $150
* 2 $10 bills = 2 x $10 = $20
* Total amount paid = $150 + $20 = $170
Answer: $170
