Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jamie and the 4 other ladies walk 3 miles together every day
* Jamie walks an additional 2 miles per day for 6 days
* Sue walks half of the additional 2 miles that Jamie walks, so 1 mile per day for 6 days
* They walk this same route 6 days a week

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by the group of 5 ladies together:
* 3 miles per day x 6 days = 18 miles per week

Next, let's calculate the additional miles walked by Jamie:
* 2 miles per day x 6 days = 12 miles per week

And the additional miles walked by Sue:
* 1 mile per day x 6 days = 6 miles per week

Finally, we add up the total miles walked:
* 18 miles (group walk) + 12 miles (Jamie's additional) + 6 miles (Sue's additional) = 36 miles per week

Answer: 36 miles
