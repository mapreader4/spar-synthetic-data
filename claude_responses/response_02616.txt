Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shop A sells Don 150 bottles
* Shop B sells Don 180 bottles
* Don is capable of buying only 550 bottles in total

To find out how many bottles Don buys from Shop C, we need to subtract the number of bottles he buys from Shop A and Shop B from the total number of bottles he can buy.

* Total bottles Don can buy = 550
* Bottles from Shop A = 150
* Bottles from Shop B = 180
* Bottles from Shop C = Total bottles - Bottles from Shop A - Bottles from Shop B
* Bottles from Shop C = 550 - 150 - 180 = 220

Answer: 220
