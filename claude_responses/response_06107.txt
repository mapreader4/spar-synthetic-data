Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dany has 4 cows and 3 sheep that eat 2 bushels a day
* So the cows and sheep eat a total of (4 + 3) * 2 = 14 bushels per day
* Dany also has 7 chickens that eat 3 bushels a day
* So the chickens eat 7 * 3 = 21 bushels per day
* To find the total bushels needed per day, we add the amounts for the cows/sheep and the chickens:
* 14 bushels + 21 bushels = 35 bushels per day

Answer: 35
