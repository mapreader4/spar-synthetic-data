Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The train can travel 5 miles for every 2 pounds of coal it consumes.
* The train has 160 pounds of coal remaining.
* To find the distance the train can travel, we need to determine how many 2-pound increments of coal the train has left.
* 160 pounds of coal / 2 pounds per increment = 80 increments of coal.
* Each increment of 2 pounds of coal allows the train to travel 5 miles.
* 80 increments of coal x 5 miles per increment = 400 miles.

Answer: 400
