Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The boys collected 200 insects and the girls collected 300 insects.
2) The total number of insects collected is 200 + 300 = 500 insects.
3) The teacher decided to divide the class equally into four groups.
4) To find the number of insects given to each group, we need to divide the total number of insects (500) by the number of groups (4).
5) 500 รท 4 = 125 insects per group.

Answer: 125
