Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The concert tickets cost $50.00 each.
2) There is a 15% processing fee for the tickets.
   * The processing fee is 15% of $50.00, which is $7.50 per ticket.
3) They are also charged $10.00 for parking.
4) There is an additional $5.00 per person entrance fee.
   * Since there are two people (Seth and his brother), the total entrance fee is $10.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
* Ticket cost: 2 tickets x $50.00 = $100.00
* Processing fee: 2 tickets x $7.50 = $15.00
* Parking fee: $10.00
* Entrance fee: $10.00
* Total cost = $100.00 + $15.00 + $10.00 + $10.00 = $135.00

Answer: $135
