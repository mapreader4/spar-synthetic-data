Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The snake is 10 feet long in total.
2) The head of the snake is one-tenth of the total length of the snake.
3) To find the length of the head, we take the total length (10 feet) and divide it by 10, since the head is one-tenth of the total length.
4) 10 feet / 10 = 1 foot, so the length of the head is 1 foot.
5) To find the length of the rest of the body minus the head, we take the total length (10 feet) and subtract the length of the head (1 foot).
6) 10 feet - 1 foot = 9 feet.

Answer: 9 feet.
