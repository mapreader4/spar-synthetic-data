Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 3 puzzles in total.
2) The first puzzle has 1000 pieces.
3) The second and third puzzles have the same number of pieces.
4) Each of the second and third puzzles has 50% more pieces than the first puzzle.
5) To calculate the number of pieces in the second and third puzzles, we take the number of pieces in the first puzzle (1000) and increase it by 50%:
   * 1000 + (1000 * 0.5) = 1000 + 500 = 1500 pieces
6) Now we can calculate the total number of pieces in all 3 puzzles:
   * 1000 (first puzzle) + 1500 (second puzzle) + 1500 (third puzzle) = 4000 pieces

Answer: 4000
