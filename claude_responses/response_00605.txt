Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ivan has 20 dice
* Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan
* To find how many dice Jerry has, we multiply Ivan's dice by 2:
  * Jerry's dice = 20 x 2 = 40 dice
* To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we add Ivan's dice and Jerry's dice:
  * Total dice = Ivan's dice + Jerry's dice
  * Total dice = 20 + 40 = 60 dice

Answer: 60
