Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Léa bought 1 book for $16
* Léa bought 3 binders for $2 each
* To calculate the cost of the binders, we multiply the number of binders (3) by the cost per binder ($2):
  * 3 binders x $2 per binder = $6
* Léa bought 6 notebooks for $1 each
* To calculate the cost of the notebooks, we multiply the number of notebooks (6) by the cost per notebook ($1):
  * 6 notebooks x $1 per notebook = $6
* To calculate the total cost, we add up the cost of the book, binders, and notebooks:
  * $16 (book) + $6 (binders) + $6 (notebooks) = $28

Answer: 28
