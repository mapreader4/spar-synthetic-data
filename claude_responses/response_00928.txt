Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 18 members in the glee club.
2) We also know that there are two times as many female members as male members.
3) Let's represent the number of male members as x.
4) Then, the number of female members would be 2x.
5) The total number of members is 18, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x = 18
6) Solving for x, we get:
3x = 18
x = 6
7) Therefore, the number of male members is 6.
8) Since there are two times as many female members as male members, the number of female members is 2 * 6 = 12.

Answer: 12
