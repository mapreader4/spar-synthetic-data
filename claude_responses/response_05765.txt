Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* For the first 2 weeks, Lily will feed the puppy 1/4 cup of food 3 times a day
* That means the puppy will eat 1/4 cup x 3 times = 3/4 cup per day
* Over 2 weeks, that's 3/4 cup x 14 days = 10.5 cups of food

* For the following 2 weeks, Lily will feed the puppy 1/2 cup of food 2 times a day
* That means the puppy will eat 1/2 cup x 2 times = 1 cup per day
* Over 2 weeks, that's 1 cup x 14 days = 14 cups of food

* Lily has already fed the puppy 1/2 cup of food today
* So the total amount of food the puppy will eat over the next 4 weeks is:
* 10.5 cups + 14 cups + 0.5 cup = 25 cups

Answer: 25 cups
