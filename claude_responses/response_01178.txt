Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Oula made 96 deliveries in the month.
2) Tona made 3/4 times as many deliveries as Oula.
3) To calculate Tona's deliveries, we take 3/4 of Oula's deliveries:
3/4 * 96 = 72 deliveries
4) Each delivery pays $100.
5) Oula's pay for the month is:
96 deliveries * $100 per delivery = $9,600
6) Tona's pay for the month is:
72 deliveries * $100 per delivery = $7,200
7) The difference in their pay is:
$9,600 - $7,200 = $2,400

Answer: $2,400
