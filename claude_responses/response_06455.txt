Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adam had 56 books in his bookcase before his shopping trip.
2) His bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf.
3) So the total capacity of his bookcase is 4 shelves x 20 books per shelf = 80 books.
4) After adding his new books, the bookcase is completely full with 2 books left over.
5) So the total number of books in the bookcase after the shopping trip is 80 + 2 = 82 books.
6) Therefore, the number of books Adam bought on his shopping trip is 82 - 56 = 26 books.

Answer: 26
