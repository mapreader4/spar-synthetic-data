Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jake's feeding allowance is $4.
2) He gave one-quarter of his allowance to his friend.
3) To find one-quarter of $4, we divide $4 by 4: $4 / 4 = $1.
4) So Jake gave his friend $1.
5) Candies cost 20 cents apiece.
6) To find how many candies his friend can purchase with $1, we divide $1 by 0.20 (the cost of one candy):
$1 / $0.20 = 5 candies.

Answer: 5 candies.
