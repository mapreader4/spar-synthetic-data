Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A single line is worth 1000 points
* A tetris is worth 8 times that much, which is 8 x 1000 = 8000 points
* Tim scored 6 singles and 4 tetrises
* To calculate the points for the singles, we take 6 singles x 1000 points per single = 6000 points
* To calculate the points for the tetrises, we take 4 tetrises x 8000 points per tetris = 32,000 points
* To get the total points, we add the points for the singles and the tetrises:
6000 points + 32,000 points = 38,000 points

Answer: 38,000
