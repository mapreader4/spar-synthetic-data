Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. James' car's original speed was 150 mph.
2. Supercharging the car increases the speed by 30%. 
   * 30% of 150 mph = 0.3 * 150 = 45 mph
   * New speed after supercharging = 150 mph + 45 mph = 195 mph

3. Cutting the weight of the car by 15% increases the speed by 10 mph.
   * New speed after weight reduction = 195 mph + 10 mph = 205 mph

Therefore, the new speed of James' car is:
Answer: 205 mph
