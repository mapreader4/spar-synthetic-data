Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The last time Jamie rescued a cat, the tree was 6 feet tall and he had to climb 12 rungs of his ladder.
* This time, the tree is 20 feet tall.
* We can assume that the relationship between the height of the tree and the number of rungs Jamie has to climb is linear.
* In the previous rescue, Jamie climbed 12 rungs for a 6-foot tree.
* To find the number of rungs he needs to climb for a 20-foot tree, we can set up a proportion:
6 feet / 12 rungs = 20 feet / x rungs
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
6x = 240
* Solving for x, we get:
x = 40 rungs

Answer: 40
