Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jan collected 65 gallons of water in a barrel
* She uses 7 gallons of water to clean each of the two cars, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 gallons
* She uses 11 fewer gallons than the two cars to water the plants, so that's 14 - 11 = 3 gallons
* So the total amount of water used for the cars and plants is 14 + 3 = 17 gallons
* The remaining amount of water is 65 - 17 = 48 gallons
* Jan uses half of the remaining 48 gallons to wash the plates and clothes, so that's 48 / 2 = 24 gallons

Answer: 24 gallons
