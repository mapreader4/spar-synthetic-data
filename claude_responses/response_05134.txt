Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jared counted 15% fewer cars than his sister Ann. This means that if Jared counted 300 cars, then Ann must have counted 15% more than 300 cars.
2) To calculate 15% more than 300 cars, we take 300 and multiply it by 1.15 (since 15% more is the same as 1.15 times the original amount).
3) 300 x 1.15 = 345 cars that Ann counted.
4) Ann counted 7 more cars than their friend Alfred, so Alfred must have counted 345 - 7 = 338 cars.
5) In total, Jared counted 300 cars, Ann counted 345 cars, and Alfred counted 338 cars.
6) Adding these together, the total number of cars counted is:
300 + 345 + 338 = 983 cars.

Answer: 983
