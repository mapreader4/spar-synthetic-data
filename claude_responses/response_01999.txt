Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool. This means we can represent the depth of John's pool as:
   John's pool depth = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5
2) We also know that John's pool is 15 feet deep. So we can substitute this into the equation from step 1:
   15 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth + 5
3) Solving for Sarah's pool depth:
   15 - 5 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth
   10 = 2 * Sarah's pool depth
   Sarah's pool depth = 10 / 2
   Sarah's pool depth = 5 feet

Answer: 5
