Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The price per organic egg is 50 cents.
2) The price of a tray of eggs that contains 30 eggs is $12.
3) To calculate the price per egg in the tray, we divide the tray price by the number of eggs in the tray:
$12 / 30 eggs = $0.40 per egg
4) The difference between the price per egg (50 cents) and the price per egg in the tray ($0.40) is:
50 cents - 40 cents = 10 cents
Therefore, you can save 10 cents per egg if you buy a tray versus individual eggs.
