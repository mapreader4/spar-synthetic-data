Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Kimberley collected 10 pounds of firewood
* Houston collected 12 pounds of firewood
* The total amount of firewood collected by the three of them is 35 pounds
* To find the amount of firewood collected by Ela, we need to subtract the amount collected by Kimberley and Houston from the total amount collected
* Kimberley collected 10 pounds and Houston collected 12 pounds, so the total amount collected by Kimberley and Houston is 10 + 12 = 22 pounds
* The total amount collected by all three of them is 35 pounds
* To find the amount collected by Ela, we subtract the amount collected by Kimberley and Houston from the total:
* 35 pounds - 22 pounds = 13 pounds

Answer: 13 pounds
