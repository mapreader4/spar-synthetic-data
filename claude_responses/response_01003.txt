Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses are $400 more than her electricity bill, which costs $800.
   * Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses = $800 + $400 = $1,200
2) The golf tournament costs 20% more than her monthly cell phone expenses.
   * 20% of $1,200 = $240
   * The golf tournament costs $1,200 + $240 = $1,440
Answer: $1,440
