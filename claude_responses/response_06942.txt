Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark has 23 kangaroos
* Kangaroos have 2 legs each
* Mark has three times as many goats as kangaroos
* So, Mark has 3 x 23 = 69 goats
* Goats have 4 legs each

To calculate the total number of legs:
* Kangaroos: 23 kangaroos x 2 legs per kangaroo = 46 legs
* Goats: 69 goats x 4 legs per goat = 276 legs
* Total legs = 46 + 276 = 322 legs

Answer: 322
