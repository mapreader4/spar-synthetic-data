Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Ben has two brothers, so there are 3 people in total who will be eating the pizza.
2) Each person can eat 12 slices of pizza.
3) So the total number of slices of pizza needed is 3 * 12 = 36 slices.
4) They have already ordered 1 small pizza, which has 8 slices.
5) So the remaining number of slices needed is 36 - 8 = 28 slices.
6) Large pizzas have 14 slices each.
7) To find the number of large pizzas needed, we divide the remaining slices needed (28) by the number of slices per large pizza (14).
8) 28 / 14 = 2 large pizzas.
