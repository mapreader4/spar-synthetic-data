Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The front wheel has 20 spokes
* The back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel
* To find the number of spokes on the back wheel, we multiply the number of spokes on the front wheel by 2:
* 20 spokes x 2 = 40 spokes on the back wheel
* To find the total number of spokes on the bicycle, we add the number of spokes on the front wheel and the number of spokes on the back wheel:
* 20 spokes + 40 spokes = 60 spokes

Answer: 60
