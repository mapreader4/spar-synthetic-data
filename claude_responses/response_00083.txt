Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats.
2. Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats as Paityn, which means Zola has 4/5 * 20 = 16 red hats.
3. Zola has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn, which means Zola has 2 * 24 = 48 blue hats.
4. In total, there are 20 + 24 + 16 + 48 = 108 hats.
5. If they share the hats equally between themselves, each of them will get 108 / 2 = 54 hats.

Answer: 54
