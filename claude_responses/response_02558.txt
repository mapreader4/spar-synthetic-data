Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) James can make a beret from 3 spools of yarn.
2) He has 12 spools of red yarn, 15 spools of black yarn, and 6 spools of blue yarn.
3) To calculate the total number of berets he can make, we need to find the minimum number of spools of each color that he has.
4) The minimum number of spools he has is 6 spools of blue yarn.
5) Since each beret requires 3 spools of yarn, he can make 6 / 3 = 2 berets from the blue yarn.
6) He has 12 spools of red yarn and 15 spools of black yarn, which is more than enough to make 2 berets.
7) Therefore, the total number of berets he can make is 2.
