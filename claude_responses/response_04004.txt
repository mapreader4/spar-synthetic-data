Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 3 spools of wire
* Each spool is 20 feet long
* So the total length of wire he has is:
  * 3 spools x 20 feet per spool = 60 feet
* It takes 4 feet to make one necklace
* To find how many necklaces he can make, we divide the total length of wire by the length needed for one necklace:
  * 60 feet / 4 feet per necklace = 15 necklaces

Answer: 15
