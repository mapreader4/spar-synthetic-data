Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Three fourths of the jelly beans are red.
2) One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored.
3) We are told that 750 jelly beans are coconut flavored.
4) Since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, that means the total number of red jelly beans is 4 times the number of coconut flavored jelly beans.
5) 4 * 750 = 3,000 red jelly beans.
6) Since three fourths of the jelly beans are red, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4/3 * 3,000 = 4,000.

Answer: 4,000
