Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Johnson needs 50 volunteers to help with decorating the auditorium
* 5 students from each of the 6 math classes have volunteered to help
* 5 students x 6 classes = 30 student volunteers
* 13 teachers have also volunteered to help
* The total number of volunteers so far is 30 students + 13 teachers = 43 volunteers
* To find the number of additional volunteers needed, we subtract the total volunteers from the required 50 volunteers:
* 50 volunteers required - 43 volunteers obtained = 7 more volunteers needed

Answer: 7
