Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sidney did 20 jumping jacks on Monday, 36 on Tuesday, 40 on Wednesday, and 50 on Thursday.
2) To find the total number of jumping jacks Sidney did, we add up the numbers for each day:
20 + 36 + 40 + 50 = 146 jumping jacks
3) Brooke does three times as many jumping jacks as Sidney.
4) To find the number of jumping jacks Brooke did, we multiply Sidney's total by 3:
146 x 3 = 438 jumping jacks

Answer: 438
