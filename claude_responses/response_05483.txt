Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* There are 4 shelves, each with 400 books
* The total number of books on the 4 shelves is 4 x 400 = 1,600 books
* The total number of books on the 4 shelves is the same as the distance in miles that Karen bikes back to her home from the library
* Therefore, the distance that Karen bikes back to her home from the library is 1,600 miles
* To calculate the total distance that Karen covers, we need to add the distance from her home to the library and the distance from the library back to her home
* The total distance is 1,600 miles + 1,600 miles = 3,200 miles

Answer: 3,200
