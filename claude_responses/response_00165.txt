Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Manex has to drive 55 miles to the destination.
2) On the way back, he has to drive 10 miles farther, which is 65 miles.
3) He can drive 1 mile in 2 minutes.
4) He stayed 2 hours at the destination.

To calculate the total time:
* Time to drive to the destination: 55 miles x 2 minutes/mile = 110 minutes = 1 hour 50 minutes
* Time to drive back: 65 miles x 2 minutes/mile = 130 minutes = 2 hours 10 minutes
* Total driving time: 1 hour 50 minutes + 2 hours 10 minutes = 4 hours
* Time spent at the destination: 2 hours

Therefore, the total time for the entire tour is:
4 hours (driving) + 2 hours (at the destination) = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
