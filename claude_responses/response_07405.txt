Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Agatha has $60 to spend on a new bike
* She spends $15 on the frame
* She spends $25 on the front wheel
* To find out how much she has left to spend on the seat and handlebar tape, we need to subtract the amount she has already spent from the total amount she had.

The total amount she has spent so far is:
* $15 (frame) + $25 (front wheel) = $40

Now, we subtract the amount she has spent from the total amount she had:
* $60 - $40 = $20

Therefore, Agatha has $20 left to spend on the seat and handlebar tape.

Answer: 20
