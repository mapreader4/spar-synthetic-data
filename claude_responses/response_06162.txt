Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The store sells pencils and erasers
* For every pencil bought, 2 erasers must be bought
* The erasers cost 1/2 the price of the pencils
* The store sold 20 pencils and earned $80

To find the cost of the erasers, we need to first find the cost of the pencils.
* If the store earned $80 from selling 20 pencils, then the cost of each pencil is $80 / 20 = $4

Now, we know that for every pencil bought, 2 erasers must be bought, and the erasers cost 1/2 the price of the pencils.
* So, the cost of each eraser is 1/2 * $4 = $2

Therefore, the cost of the erasers is $2.
