Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael bought a suit for $430
* Michael bought shoes for $190
* The total cost of the suit and shoes is $430 + $190 = $620
* Michael received a $100 discount
* To find the amount Michael paid to the seller, we need to subtract the $100 discount from the total cost of $620
* $620 - $100 = $520

Answer: $520
