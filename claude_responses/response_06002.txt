Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kathryn's rent was $1200 per month
* Her food and travel expenses were 2 times her rent, so $2400 per month
* Now that Shelby has moved in, the rent is split in half, so Kathryn's rent is now $600 per month
* Her total expenses are now $600 (rent) + $1200 (food and travel) = $1800 per month
* Her salary is $5000 per month
* To calculate the amount of money remaining after her expenses, we subtract her expenses from her salary:
* $5000 (salary) - $1800 (expenses) = $3200

Answer: $3200
