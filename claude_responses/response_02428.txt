Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wilson has 2 tall hills and 3 small hills
* He sleds down the tall hills 4 times each
* So for the tall hills, he sleds down a total of 2 * 4 = 8 times
* He sleds down the small hills half as often as the tall hills
* So for the small hills, he sleds down a total of 3 * (4/2) = 6 times
* To find the total number of times he sleds down the hills, we add the times for the tall hills and the small hills:
* 8 + 6 = 14 times

Answer: 14
