Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) To make a dog collar, it takes 18 inches of nylon.
2) Janet needs to make 9 dog collars.
3) To calculate the total nylon needed for the dog collars, we multiply the number of dog collars (9) by the amount of nylon needed per dog collar (18 inches):
9 dog collars x 18 inches per dog collar = 162 inches of nylon for the dog collars.
4) To make a cat collar, it takes 10 inches of nylon.
5) Janet needs to make 3 cat collars.
6) To calculate the total nylon needed for the cat collars, we multiply the number of cat collars (3) by the amount of nylon needed per cat collar (10 inches):
3 cat collars x 10 inches per cat collar = 30 inches of nylon for the cat collars.
7) To get the total nylon needed, we add the nylon needed for the dog collars and the cat collars:
162 inches + 30 inches = 192 inches of nylon.

Answer: 192 inches
