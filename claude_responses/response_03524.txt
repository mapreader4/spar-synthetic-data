Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first pair of dumbbells are 3 lb weights. So, the total weight of the first pair is 2 * 3 lb = 6 lb.
2) The second pair of dumbbells are 5 lb weights. So, the total weight of the second pair is 2 * 5 lb = 10 lb.
3) The third pair of dumbbells are 8 lb weights. So, the total weight of the third pair is 2 * 8 lb = 16 lb.
4) To find the total weight of the entire system, we add up the weights of the three pairs:
6 lb + 10 lb + 16 lb = 32 lb.

Answer: 32
