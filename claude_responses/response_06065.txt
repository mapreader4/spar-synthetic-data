Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Anna has 50 pencils.
2) Harry has twice the number of Anna's pencils. So, Harry has 2 x 50 = 100 pencils.
3) However, Harry lost 19 of his pencils.
4) To find the number of pencils left with Harry, we take the original number of pencils (100) and subtract the number of pencils he lost (19).
5) 100 - 19 = 81 pencils.

Answer: 81
