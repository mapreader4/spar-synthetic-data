Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The game is 880 MB in size
* Mason has already downloaded 310 MB
* The remaining amount to download is 880 MB - 310 MB = 570 MB
* The download speed is now 3 MB/minute
* To calculate the time it will take to download the remaining 570 MB, we divide the remaining amount by the download speed:
* 570 MB / 3 MB/minute = 190 minutes

Answer: 190
