Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leo has to write a 400-word story
* 10 words fit on each line of his notebook
* 20 lines fit on each page
* Lucas has filled one and a half pages

First, let's calculate how many words fit on one page:
* 10 words per line x 20 lines per page = 200 words per page

Now, let's calculate how many words Lucas has written so far:
* 1.5 pages x 200 words per page = 300 words

Finally, to find how many words Lucas has left to write, we subtract the number of words he has written from the total number of words required:
* 400 words - 300 words = 100 words

Answer: 100
