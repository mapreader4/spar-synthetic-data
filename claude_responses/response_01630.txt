Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cobbler can mend 3 pairs of shoes in an hour.
* From Monday to Thursday, he works for 8 hours each day.
* On Friday, he works from 8am to 11am, which is 3 hours.

First, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes he can mend each day:
* Monday to Thursday: 3 pairs per hour x 8 hours = 24 pairs per day
* Friday: 3 pairs per hour x 3 hours = 9 pairs

Now, let's calculate the total number of pairs he can mend in a week:
* Monday to Thursday: 24 pairs per day x 4 days = 96 pairs
* Friday: 9 pairs
* Total pairs mended in a week: 96 + 9 = 105 pairs

Answer: 105
