Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mandy has three $20 bills, which means she has 3 x $20 = $60 in total.
2) Manny has two $50 bills, which means he has 2 x $50 = $100 in total.
3) If they both exchange their bills for $10 bills, Mandy will have $60 / $10 = 6 $10 bills.
4) Manny will have $100 / $10 = 10 $10 bills.
5) The difference between the number of $10 bills Manny has and the number of $10 bills Mandy has is 10 - 6 = 4.
