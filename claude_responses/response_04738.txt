Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 2000 pinecones on the ground.
2) 20% of the pinecones are eaten by reindeer. To calculate this, we take 20% of 2000: 0.20 * 2000 = 400 pinecones eaten by reindeer.
3) Twice as many pinecones are eaten by squirrels as by reindeer. Since 400 were eaten by reindeer, the number eaten by squirrels is 2 * 400 = 800 pinecones.
4) The remaining pinecones after the reindeer and squirrels have eaten is 2000 - 400 - 800 = 800 pinecones.
5) 25% of the remaining 800 pinecones are collected to make fires. To calculate this, we take 25% of 800: 0.25 * 800 = 200 pinecones collected.
6) The number of pinecones left is the original 2000 minus the pinecones eaten by reindeer (400), the pinecones eaten by squirrels (800), and the pinecones collected for fires (200).
Answer: 600 pinecones left.
