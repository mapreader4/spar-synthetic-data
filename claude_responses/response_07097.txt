Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Paul bought 45 cookies
* Paula bought 3 fewer cookies than Paul
* To find how many cookies Paula bought, we subtract 3 from Paul's 45 cookies:
  * Paula's cookies = 45 - 3 = 42 cookies
* To find the total number of cookies they have altogether, we add Paul's cookies and Paula's cookies:
  * Total cookies = Paul's cookies + Paula's cookies
  * Total cookies = 45 + 42 = 87 cookies

Answer: 87
