Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Peter is buying 16 pounds of bone-in chicken
* He's buying half the amount of chicken in hamburgers
* So, the amount of hamburgers is 16 / 2 = 8 pounds
* He's buying 2 more pounds of hot dogs than hamburgers
* So, the amount of hot dogs is 8 + 2 = 10 pounds
* The amount of sides is half the amount of hot dogs
* So, the amount of sides is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds

Now, we can add up all the amounts to get the total pounds of food:
* 16 pounds of chicken
* 8 pounds of hamburgers
* 10 pounds of hot dogs
* 5 pounds of sides
* Total = 16 + 8 + 10 + 5 = 39 pounds
