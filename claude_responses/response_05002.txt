Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James has 3 more than 2 times the number of Oreos Jordan has
* Let's represent the number of Oreos Jordan has as x
* Then, James has 2x + 3 Oreos
* The total number of Oreos is 36
* So, we can write the equation:
x + (2x + 3) = 36
* Solving for x:
3x + 3 = 36
3x = 33
x = 11

Answer: 11
