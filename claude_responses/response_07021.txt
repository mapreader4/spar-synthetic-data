Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The road is 3 miles long
* A car comes down the road every 20 minutes
* We want to know how many hours have passed once 30 cars have come down the road

First, let's calculate how long it takes for 30 cars to come down the road:
* 1 car comes down every 20 minutes
* 30 cars will take 30 * 20 = 600 minutes

Now, we need to convert 600 minutes to hours:
* 600 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 10 hours

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 10 hours
