Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mathilda paid an initial installment of $125
* She still has 75% left to pay
* To find the original amount she owed, we need to find the remaining 25% (100% - 75%)
* If the remaining 25% is the amount she still owes, then the original amount she owed is 4 times that (100% / 25% = 4)
* So, if the remaining 25% is the amount she still owes, and that amount is 4 times the initial installment of $125, then the original amount she owed was 4 * $125 = $500

Answer: 500
