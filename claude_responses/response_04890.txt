Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marcus' car had 1728 miles on it before the trip
* His car gets 30 miles per gallon
* His car holds 20 gallons of gas
* He filled his empty gas tank twice, which means he used up 40 gallons of gas (2 x 20 gallons)
* To calculate the total miles driven, we can use the formula:
    * Total miles driven = Miles per gallon x Gallons of gas used
    * Total miles driven = 30 miles/gallon x 40 gallons
    * Total miles driven = 1200 miles

Now, to find the total miles on the car after the trip, we add the original 1728 miles to the 1200 miles driven on the trip:
* Total miles on car = 1728 miles + 1200 miles
* Total miles on car = 2928 miles

Answer: 2928
