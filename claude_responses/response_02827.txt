Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital he is hired into.
2) This means that the hospital's age in five years will be 3/2 times Grant's age in five years.
3) Grant's current age is 25 years old.
4) In five years, Grant will be 25 + 5 = 30 years old.
5) The hospital's age in five years will be 3/2 * 30 = 45 years old.
6) Therefore, the hospital's current age is 45 - 5 = 40 years old.

Answer: 40
