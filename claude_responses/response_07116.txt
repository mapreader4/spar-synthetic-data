Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces
* She packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes
* This means each box contains 12 / 4 = 3 eggs
* One of the boxes is left by the window and melted, so it is discarded
* We need to find the total weight of the remaining 3 boxes of chocolate eggs

To calculate the total weight:
* Each egg weighs 10 ounces
* Each box contains 3 eggs
* So the weight of each box is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces
* There are 3 remaining boxes
* Therefore, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is 3 * 30 = 90 ounces

Answer: 90
