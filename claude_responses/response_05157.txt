Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The customer's check is $15.00.
2) The state applies a 20% tax to restaurant sales.
3) To calculate the tax, we take 20% of $15.00, which is 0.20 * $15.00 = $3.00.
4) The total amount the customer owes, including the tax, is $15.00 + $3.00 = $18.00.
5) The customer gave Jason a $20 bill.
6) To calculate the tip, we take the amount the customer paid ($20.00) and subtract the total amount owed ($18.00).
7) $20.00 - $18.00 = $2.00.
