Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bailey needs to buy 2 sets of towels for the guest bathroom, and each set costs $40.00.
2) So the total cost for the guest bathroom towels is 2 x $40.00 = $80.00.
3) Bailey also needs to buy 4 sets of towels for the master bathroom, and each set costs $50.00.
4) So the total cost for the master bathroom towels is 4 x $50.00 = $200.00.
5) The store is offering a 20% discount on all towel sets.
6) To calculate the discount, we take 20% of the total cost before the discount:
   * Total cost before discount = $80.00 + $200.00 = $280.00
   * Discount = 20% of $280.00 = 0.20 x $280.00 = $56.00
7) The total cost after the 20% discount is the original total cost minus the discount:
   * $280.00 - $56.00 = $224.00

Answer: $224
