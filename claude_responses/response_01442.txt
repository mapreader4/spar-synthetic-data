Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Jame can tear 30 cards at a time
* A new deck of cards has 55 cards (including jokers and blank cards)
* Jame tears cards 3 times a week
* He buys 18 decks

First, we need to calculate how many cards he can tear in a week:
* 30 cards per tear x 3 tears per week = 90 cards per week

Next, we need to calculate how many cards he has in total:
* 18 decks x 55 cards per deck = 990 cards

Now, we can calculate how many weeks he can go:
* 990 cards / 90 cards per week = 11 weeks

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 11 weeks
