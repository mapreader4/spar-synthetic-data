Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each floral arrangement needs:
  - 8 roses
  - 12 daisies
  - 3 snapdragons
  - Twice as many lilies as snapdragons, which is 2 x 3 = 6 lilies
* So each arrangement requires:
  - 8 roses
  - 12 daisies
  - 3 snapdragons
  - 6 lilies
  - Total of 8 + 12 + 3 + 6 = 29 flowers per arrangement
* There will be 10 tables at the reception
* Therefore, the total number of flowers needed is:
  - 29 flowers per arrangement x 10 tables = 290 flowers

Answer: 290
