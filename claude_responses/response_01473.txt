Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The bookseller sold 15 books in January and 16 books in February.
2) The average number of books sold per month across all three months is 16.
3) To find the number of books sold in March, we can use the formula for average:
   Average = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)
4) In this case, the average is 16, and we have 3 months, so:
   16 = (15 + 16 + x) / 3
   where x is the number of books sold in March.
5) Solving for x, we get:
   48 = 15 + 16 + x
   x = 17
Answer: 17
