Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joe's bid was $160,000
2) Nelly outbid Joe by paying $2,000 more than thrice his bid
3. To calculate thrice Joe's bid, we multiply $160,000 by 3:
   3 x $160,000 = $480,000
4. Now, we add $2,000 to this amount to get Nelly's winning bid:
   $480,000 + $2,000 = $482,000

Answer: $482,000
