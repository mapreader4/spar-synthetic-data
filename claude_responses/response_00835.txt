Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lana saw 100 cars in the front parking lot.
2) She saw two times more vehicles at the back than there were in the front parking lot. That means there were 2 x 100 = 200 cars in the back parking lot.
3) So the total number of cars at the start of the play was 100 + 200 = 300.
4) The total number of cars at the end of the play was 700.
5) To find how many more cars packed into the parking lot during the play, we subtract the initial number of cars (300) from the final number of cars (700).
Answer: 400
