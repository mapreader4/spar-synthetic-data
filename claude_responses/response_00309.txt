Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carl types at a speed of 50 words per minute
* He types continuously for 4 hours per day
* We need to find how many words he can type in 7 days

First, let's calculate how many words he can type in 1 day:
* 50 words per minute x 60 minutes per hour x 4 hours per day = 12,000 words per day

Now, we can calculate how many words he can type in 7 days:
* 12,000 words per day x 7 days = 84,000 words

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 84,000
