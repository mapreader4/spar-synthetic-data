Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The three square 6-foot by 6-foot paintings:
   - Each painting has an area of 6 feet x 6 feet = 36 square feet
   - There are 3 of these paintings, so the total area is 3 x 36 = 108 square feet

2. The four small 2-foot by 3-foot paintings:
   - Each painting has an area of 2 feet x 3 feet = 6 square feet
   - There are 4 of these paintings, so the total area is 4 x 6 = 24 square feet

3. The one large 10-foot by 15-foot painting:
   - This painting has an area of 10 feet x 15 feet = 150 square feet

4. To find the total area of the art collection, we add up the areas of all the paintings:
   - Total area = 108 + 24 + 150 = 282 square feet

Answer: 282 square feet
