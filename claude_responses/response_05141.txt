Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Appetizer cost: $9.00
* 2 Entrees at $20.00 each = $40.00
* Dessert cost: $11.00
* Total of the food items: $9.00 + $40.00 + $11.00 = $60.00
* The tip is 30% of the total food cost, which is 0.30 * $60.00 = $18.00
* The entire price of the meal is the total food cost plus the tip:
$60.00 + $18.00 = $78.00

Answer: $78
