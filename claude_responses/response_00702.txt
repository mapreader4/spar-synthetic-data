Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lily had $55 in her account.
2) She spent $7 on a shirt.
3) She then went to another shop and spent thrice as much as she spent on the shirt.
   * Thrice as much as $7 is 3 x $7 = $21.
4) So the total amount Lily spent is $7 (on the shirt) + $21 (at the other shop) = $28.
5) To find the amount of money left in Lily's account, we take the initial amount ($55) and subtract the total amount spent ($28).
   * $55 - $28 = $27.

Answer: $27.
