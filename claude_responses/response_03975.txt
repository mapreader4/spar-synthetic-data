Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cheryl walked 2 miles every hour
* She walked for 3 hours
* So, the distance she walked away from home is:
    - 2 miles per hour x 3 hours = 6 miles
* Then, she walked back home, which is the same distance as the way she walked away
    - 6 miles back home
* Therefore, the total distance Cheryl walked is:
    - 6 miles away + 6 miles back = 12 miles

Answer: 12
