Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The boat is traveling at a speed of 10 MPH
* It takes 2 hours to travel the length of the lake
* So the length of the lake is 10 MPH * 2 hours = 20 miles
* It then takes 30 minutes to travel the width of the lake
* Since the speed is the same, the width of the lake is 10 MPH * 0.5 hours = 5 miles
* The area of the lake is the length times the width, which is 20 miles * 5 miles = 100 square miles

Answer: 100
