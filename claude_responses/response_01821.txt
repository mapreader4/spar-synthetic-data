Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 24 students in the class
* One-third of the 24 students had their portraits taken before lunch
* To calculate one-third of 24, we divide 24 by 3: 24 / 3 = 8 students had their portraits taken before lunch
* After lunch, but before gym class, 10 additional students had their portraits taken
* So the total number of students who have had their portraits taken so far is 8 + 10 = 18 students
* To find the number of students who have not yet had their picture taken, we subtract the number of students who have had their picture taken from the total number of students in the class:
* 24 students - 18 students who have had their picture taken = 6 students who have not yet had their picture taken
