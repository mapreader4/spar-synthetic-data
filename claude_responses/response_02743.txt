Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The store has 2000 different items that would normally retail for $50 each.
2) They are offering an 80% discount, which means the items are being sold for 20% of the original price, or $10 each.
3) They manage to sell 90% of the 2000 items, which is 1800 items.
4) The total revenue from the sale is 1800 items x $10 per item = $18,000.
5) The store owed $15,000 to their creditors.
6) The amount of money they have left after the sale is the total revenue ($18,000) minus the amount owed to creditors ($15,000).

Answer: $3,000
