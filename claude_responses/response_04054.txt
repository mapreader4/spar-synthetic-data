Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John pays $1000 upfront.
2) The lawyer charges $100 per hour.
3) The lawyer has to work 50 hours in court time.
4) The lawyer has to work 2 times that long in prep time, which is 2 x 50 = 100 hours.
5) The total hours the lawyer has to work is 50 + 100 = 150 hours.
6) The total fee for the lawyer's services is 150 hours x $100 per hour = $15,000.
7) John's brother pays half the fee, so John pays the other half, which is $15,000 / 2 = $7,500.
8) Adding the $1,000 upfront payment, the total amount John paid is $7,500 + $1,000 = $8,500.

Answer: $8,500
