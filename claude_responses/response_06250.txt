Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. For the first one and a half hours, Bob drove at 60 mph.
   * Distance traveled in the first one and a half hours = 60 mph × 1.5 hours = 90 miles

2. For the next 2 hours, Bob drove at 45 mph.
   * Distance traveled in the next 2 hours = 45 mph × 2 hours = 90 miles

3. To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from the two parts:
   * Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 90 miles = 180 miles

Answer: 180 miles
