Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In twenty years, Ramon will be twice as old as Loui is today
* Loui is currently 23 years old
* So, in twenty years, Ramon will be twice as old as 23, which is 46 years old
* To find Ramon's current age, we need to subtract 20 years from 46 years
* 46 years - 20 years = 26 years

Answer: 26
