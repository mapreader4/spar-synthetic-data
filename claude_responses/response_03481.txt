Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miriam currently has 30 marbles
* She gave her brother 60 marbles
* She gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, which is 2 * 60 = 120 marbles
* She gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, which is 3 * 30 = 90 marbles

Now, to find the total number of marbles Miriam started with, we need to add up all the marbles she gave away and the marbles she currently has:
* 60 + 120 + 90 + 30 = 300 marbles

Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles.

Answer: 300
