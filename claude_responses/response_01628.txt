To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of pizza that TreShawn, Michael, and LaMar will consume, and then determine the number of pizzas needed to satisfy their appetite.

Given information:
- TreShawn eats 1/2 a pizza.
- Michael eats 1/3 of a pizza.
- LaMar eats 1/6 of a pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of pizza consumed by the three friends.
TreShawn's consumption = 1/2 pizza
Michael's consumption = 1/3 pizza
LaMar's consumption = 1/6 pizza
Total consumption = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1 pizza

Step 2: Determine the number of pizzas needed to satisfy their appetite.
Since the total consumption is 1 pizza, TreShawn's mom needs to order at least 1 pizza.

Answer: 1 pizza
