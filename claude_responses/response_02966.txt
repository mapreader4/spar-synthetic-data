Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark takes 2 Tylenol tablets of 500 mg each
* He takes these every 4 hours
* He does this for 12 hours

First, let's calculate the total amount of Tylenol he takes per dose:
* 2 tablets x 500 mg per tablet = 1000 mg per dose

Next, let's calculate how many doses he takes in 12 hours:
* 12 hours / 4 hours per dose = 3 doses

Now, we can calculate the total amount of Tylenol he takes:
* 3 doses x 1000 mg per dose = 3000 mg

Finally, we need to convert the total amount from milligrams to grams:
* 3000 mg / 1000 mg per gram = 3 grams

Answer: 3 grams
