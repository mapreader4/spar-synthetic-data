Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* For every white duck, there are 5 fish
* There are 3 white ducks
* So, for the white ducks, there are 3 * 5 = 15 fish

* For every black duck, there are 10 fish
* There are 7 black ducks
* So, for the black ducks, there are 7 * 10 = 70 fish

* For every multicolor duck, there are 12 fish
* There are 6 multicolor ducks
* So, for the multicolor ducks, there are 6 * 12 = 72 fish

* To get the total number of fish, we add up the fish for each type of duck:
* Total fish = 15 + 70 + 72 = 157

Answer: 157
