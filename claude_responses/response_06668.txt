Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Winston initially had 10 gallons of gas in his tank.
* He drove to the store and used 6 gallons of gas.
* So, after the trip to the store, he had 10 - 6 = 4 gallons of gas remaining in the tank.
* He then drove to the doctor's office and used 2 more gallons of gas.
* So, after the trip to the doctor's office, he had 4 - 2 = 2 gallons of gas remaining in the tank.
* The tank can hold up to 12 gallons of gas.
* So, to refill the entire tank, he would need to add 12 - 2 = 10 gallons of gas.
