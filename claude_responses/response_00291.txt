Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* This week, Mary used 15 gallons of fuel.
* Last week, she used 20% less fuel than this week.
* To calculate how much fuel she used last week, we need to find 20% of 15 gallons and subtract that from 15 gallons.
* 20% of 15 gallons is 0.2 * 15 = 3 gallons.
* So last week, she used 15 gallons - 3 gallons = 12 gallons of fuel.
* To find the total fuel used over the two weeks, we add the fuel used this week (15 gallons) and the fuel used last week (12 gallons).
* 15 gallons + 12 gallons = 27 gallons.

Answer: 27 gallons.
