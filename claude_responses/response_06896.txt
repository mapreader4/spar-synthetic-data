Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cindy and Olaf made 15 candied apples and they are selling them for $2 each.
2) To calculate the total earnings from the candied apples, we multiply the number of apples (15) by the price per apple ($2):
   15 apples x $2 per apple = $30
3) Cindy and Olaf also made 12 candied grapes and they are selling them for $1.5 each.
4) To calculate the total earnings from the candied grapes, we multiply the number of grapes (12) by the price per grape ($1.5):
   12 grapes x $1.5 per grape = $18
5) To calculate the total earnings, we add the earnings from the apples and the grapes:
   $30 (apples) + $18 (grapes) = $48

Answer: $48
