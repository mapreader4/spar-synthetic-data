Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Garcia pays her insurance quarterly
* Quarterly means every 3 months
* The amount she pays each quarter is $378
* To calculate the total amount she pays in a year, we need to multiply the quarterly payment by the number of quarters in a year
* There are 4 quarters in a year (3 months x 4 = 12 months)
* So, the total amount Mrs. Garcia pays in a year is:
$378 x 4 = $1,512

Answer: 1,512
