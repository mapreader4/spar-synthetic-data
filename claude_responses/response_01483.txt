Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mia has 3 siblings, and she spent $30 on each sibling's gift.
2) The total amount spent on the 3 siblings' gifts is 3 x $30 = $90.
3) Mia spent a total of $150 on all the Christmas gifts.
4) The amount spent on the parents' gifts is the total amount spent ($150) minus the amount spent on the siblings' gifts ($90), which is $150 - $90 = $60.
5) Since the parents' gifts were of equal value, we can divide the total amount spent on the parents' gifts ($60) by 2 to get the amount spent on each parent's gift.
Answer: $30
