Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Trisha spent:
    - $17 on meat
    - $22 on chicken
    - $43 on veggies
    - $5 on eggs
    - $45 on dog food
* So the total amount she spent is:
    - $17 + $22 + $43 + $5 + $45 = $132
* When she left the store, she had $35 left.
* So the amount of money she brought with her at the beginning was:
    - $132 (total spent) + $35 (amount left) = $167

Answer: 167
