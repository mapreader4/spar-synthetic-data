Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has to wait 20 minutes for the first dose of the vaccine.
* The second dose has a wait time that is half as long as the first dose.
* To calculate the wait time for the second dose, we take the wait time for the first dose (20 minutes) and divide it by 2.
* 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes
* So the wait time for the second dose is 10 minutes.
* To calculate the total wait time, we add the wait time for the first dose (20 minutes) and the wait time for the second dose (10 minutes).
* 20 minutes + 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Answer: 30
