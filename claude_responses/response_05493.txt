Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Christina's age will be half of 80 years in five years to come.
   * This means that in 5 years, Christina will be 40 years old (half of 80).
   * Therefore, Christina's current age is 40 - 5 = 35 years old.

2. Oscar will be 3/5 times as old as Christina is now in 15 years.
   * This means that in 15 years, Oscar will be 3/5 * 35 = 21 years old.
   * Therefore, Oscar's current age is 21 - 15 = 6 years old.
