Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In July, Diana earned $150
* In August, she earned 3 times the amount she earned in July
* To calculate her August earnings:
    - July earnings: $150
    - August earnings: 3 x $150 = $450
* In September, she earned twice the amount she earned in August
* To calculate her September earnings:
    - August earnings: $450
    - September earnings: 2 x $450 = $900
* Now we can calculate the total amount Diana earned over the three months:
    - July earnings: $150
    - August earnings: $450
    - September earnings: $900
    - Total earnings: $150 + $450 + $900 = $1,500

Answer: $1,500
