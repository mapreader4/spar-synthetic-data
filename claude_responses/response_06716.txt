Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The full marker has enough ink to paint three 4 inch by 4 inch squares.
2) The area of each 4 inch by 4 inch square is 4 inches x 4 inches = 16 square inches.
3) The total area that can be painted with the full marker is 3 x 16 square inches = 48 square inches.
4) TreShaun colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles.
5) The area of each 6 inch by 2 inch rectangle is 6 inches x 2 inches = 12 square inches.
6) The total area colored in is 2 x 12 square inches = 24 square inches.
7) The remaining area that can be painted is 48 square inches - 24 square inches = 24 square inches.
8) To calculate the percentage of ink left, we take the remaining area (24 square inches) and divide it by the total area (48 square inches), then multiply by 100:
(24 / 48) x 100 = 50%

Answer: 50
