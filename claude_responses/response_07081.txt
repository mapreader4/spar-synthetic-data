Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The teacher purchased school supplies that cost $13 and $24.
2) The total cost of the school supplies is $13 + $24 = $37.
3) The teacher had a remaining $6 budget from last year.
4) The teacher was given a $50 budget for this year.
5) The total budget available to the teacher is $6 (remaining from last year) + $50 (this year's budget) = $56.
6) After purchasing the school supplies costing $37, the remaining budget is $56 - $37 = $19.
