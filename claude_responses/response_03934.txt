Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janet goes to the gym for 5 hours a week
* She goes on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday
* On Monday and Wednesday, she spends 1.5 hours each day
* So on Monday and Wednesday, she spends a total of 3 hours (1.5 hours x 2 days)
* That leaves 2 hours (5 hours total - 3 hours on Monday and Wednesday)
* Since she spends the same amount of time on Tuesday and Friday, and we know she spends 2 hours total on those two days, that means she spends 1 hour on Friday.

Answer: 1 hour
