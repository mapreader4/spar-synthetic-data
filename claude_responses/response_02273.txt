Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Pasture rental:
   * Andrea pays $500 per month
   * In a year, there are 12 months
   * So the total cost for pasture rental in a year is:
     * $500 per month x 12 months = $6,000

2. Food:
   * Andrea pays $10 per day for food
   * In a year, there are 365 days
   * So the total cost for food in a year is:
     * $10 per day x 365 days = $3,650

3. Lessons:
   * Andrea pays $60 per lesson
   * She has two lessons per week
   * In a year, there are 52 weeks
   * So the total cost for lessons in a year is:
     * $60 per lesson x 2 lessons per week x 52 weeks = $6,240

4. Total cost:
   * Adding up the costs for pasture rental, food, and lessons:
     * $6,000 + $3,650 + $6,240 = $15,890

Answer: $15,890
