Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tara already has $10 saved
* The clarinet costs $90
* She sells each book for $5
* When she is halfway towards her goal, she loses all her savings and has to start over

First, let's calculate how much money she needs to save in total:
* Clarinet costs $90
* She already has $10 saved
* So, she needs to save $90 - $10 = $80 more

Now, let's calculate how much she needs to save when she is halfway towards her goal:
* Halfway towards her goal is $80 / 2 = $40

When she loses all her savings, she has to start over from $0. So, she needs to save the full $80 again.

In total, she needs to save $40 + $80 = $120.

Each book she sells gives her $5, so we can calculate the total number of books she needs to sell:
* $120 / $5 per book = 24 books

Answer: 24
