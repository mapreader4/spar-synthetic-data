Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first tank is 300 liters filled.
2) The second tank is 450 liters filled.
3) The second tank is only 45% filled.
4) The two tanks have the same capacity.
5) To find the total capacity of the tanks, we can use the information about the second tank being 45% filled. Since it is 450 liters filled, and that is 45% of the total capacity, we can calculate the total capacity:
   * 450 liters = 45% of total capacity
   * Total capacity = 450 / 0.45 = 1000 liters
6) Since the two tanks have the same capacity, the first tank also has a capacity of 1000 liters.
7) To find the amount of water needed to fill the two tanks, we need to subtract the amount of water already in the tanks from the total capacity:
   * Total capacity = 2 x 1000 = 2000 liters
   * Water already in the tanks = 300 + 450 = 750 liters
   * Water needed to fill the tanks = 2000 - 750 = 1250 liters

Answer: 1250 liters
