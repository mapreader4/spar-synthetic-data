Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John needs to support 6 cans of soda, each with 12 ounces of soda.
2) Each can weighs 2 ounces when empty.
3) The total weight of the 6 cans of soda is:
   - 6 cans x 12 ounces of soda per can = 72 ounces of soda
4) The total weight of the 6 empty cans is:
   - 6 cans x 2 ounces per can = 12 ounces
5) John also adds 2 more empty cans.
   - 2 cans x 2 ounces per can = 4 ounces
6) To calculate the total weight the bridge must support:
   - Weight of 6 cans of soda (72 ounces) 
   - Plus weight of 6 empty cans (12 ounces)
   - Plus weight of 2 additional empty cans (4 ounces)
   - Total weight = 72 + 12 + 4 = 88 ounces

Answer: 88 ounces
