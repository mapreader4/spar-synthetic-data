Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Every day, the frog eats 2 flies
* In the morning, Betty catches 5 flies
* In the afternoon, Betty catches 6 more flies, but one escapes, so she ends up with 5 more flies
* So, in total, Betty catches 5 + 5 = 10 flies per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* So, the total number of flies Betty catches in a week is 10 flies per day x 7 days = 70 flies
* The frog eats 2 flies per day, so in a week the frog eats 2 flies per day x 7 days = 14 flies
* Therefore, the number of more flies Betty needs is 14 (the number the frog eats in a week) - 70 (the number Betty catches in a week) = -56

Answer: -56
