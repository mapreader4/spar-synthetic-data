Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim initially had some number of cans of soda
* Jeff took 6 cans of soda from Tim
* Tim then bought another half the amount of soda cans he had left
* In the end, Tim had 24 cans of soda

Let's call the initial number of cans Tim had as 'x'.

After Jeff took 6 cans, Tim had (x - 6) cans left.
Tim then bought another half the amount of soda cans he had left, which is (x - 6)/2.

The total number of cans Tim had in the end is:
(x - 6) + (x - 6)/2 = 24

Solving this equation:
(x - 6) + (x - 6)/2 = 24
(3x - 18)/2 = 24
3x - 18 = 48
3x = 66
x = 22

Therefore, Tim had 22 cans of soda at first.

Answer: 22
