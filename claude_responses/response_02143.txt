Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first competitor jumped 22 feet.
* The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, so they jumped 22 + 1 = 23 feet.
* The third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the second competitor, so they jumped 23 - 2 = 21 feet.
* The fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor, so they jumped 21 + 3 = 24 feet.

Answer: 24 feet.
