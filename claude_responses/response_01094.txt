Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janice starts with 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder and 16 tablespoons of water.
2) 4 tablespoons of water evaporate, so now there are 12 tablespoons of water left.
3) Janice then quadruples the amount of water, so now there are 48 tablespoons of water.
4) The total amount of liquid in the jug is 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder + 48 tablespoons of water = 50 tablespoons.
5) To calculate the percentage of koolaid powder in the liquid, we take the amount of koolaid powder (2 tablespoons) and divide it by the total amount of liquid (50 tablespoons), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
6) 2 tablespoons / 50 tablespoons = 0.04
7) 0.04 x 100 = 4%
