To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Tim bikes in a week and then divide it by his biking speed to find the total time spent biking.

Given information:
- Tim's work is 20 miles away.
- Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.
- Tim goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.
- Tim can bike at 25 mph.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Tim bikes in a week.
Distance to work and back (per day) = 20 miles × 2 = 40 miles
Total distance for 5 workdays = 40 miles × 5 = 200 miles
Weekend bike ride = 200 miles
Total distance biked in a week = 200 miles + 200 miles = 400 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total time Tim spends biking in a week.
Total time spent biking = Total distance biked / Biking speed
Total time spent biking = 400 miles / 25 mph = 16 hours

Answer: 16 hours
