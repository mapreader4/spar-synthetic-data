Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Teresa orders 2 fancy ham and cheese sandwiches at $7.75 each
* 2 sandwiches x $7.75 each = $15.50 for the sandwiches
* She also buys:
  - Salami for $4.00
  - Brie, which is 3 times the price of the salami, so 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
  - 1/4 pound of olives at $10.00 per pound, so 1/4 x $10.00 = $2.50
  - 1/2 pound of feta cheese at $8.00 per pound, so 1/2 x $8.00 = $4.00
  - 1 loaf of french bread for $2.00
* Adding up all the items:
  - Sandwiches: $15.50
  - Salami: $4.00
  - Brie: $12.00
  - Olives: $2.50
  - Feta cheese: $4.00
  - French bread: $2.00
* Total amount spent at the local shop:
  $15.50 + $4.00 + $12.00 + $2.50 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $40.00
