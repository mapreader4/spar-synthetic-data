Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Last week, Kenny did a total of 324 jumping jacks
* This week, so far he has done:
    - Sunday: 34 jumping jacks
    - Monday: 20 jumping jacks
    - Tuesday: 0 jumping jacks (he skipped a day)
    - Wednesday: 123 jumping jacks
    - Thursday: 64 jumping jacks
    - Friday: 23 jumping jacks
* So the total number of jumping jacks he has done so far this week is:
    34 + 20 + 0 + 123 + 64 + 23 = 264 jumping jacks
* To beat last week's total of 324 jumping jacks, he needs to do at least 325 jumping jacks this week.
* Therefore, the number of jumping jacks he needs to do on Saturday is:
    325 - 264 = 61 jumping jacks

Answer: 61
