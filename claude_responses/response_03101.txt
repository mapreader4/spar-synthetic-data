Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The convenience store sells 180 gallons of soda per week
* Each box of syrup can make 30 gallons of soda
* Each box of syrup costs $40

To calculate how much they pay for syrup per week, we need to determine how many boxes of syrup they need to buy to make 180 gallons of soda.

* 180 gallons of soda / 30 gallons per box = 6 boxes of syrup needed per week
* 6 boxes of syrup x $40 per box = $240 spent on syrup per week

Answer: $240
