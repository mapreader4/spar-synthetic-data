Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marly adds 2 quarts of milk to the soup.
2) He also adds three times as much chicken stock as milk. So, that's 3 x 2 = 6 quarts of chicken stock.
3) He adds 1 quart of pureed vegetables.
4) So the total amount of soup is 2 quarts (milk) + 6 quarts (chicken stock) + 1 quart (pureed vegetables) = 9 quarts.
5) Marly divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each.
6) To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of soup (9 quarts) by the capacity of each bag (3 quarts).
7) 9 quarts / 3 quarts per bag = 3 bags.
