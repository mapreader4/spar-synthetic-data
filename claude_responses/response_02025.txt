Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The bus leaves the station every half-hour, which means there are 2 buses per hour.
2) The station is open for 12 hours a day.
3) So in 1 day, there are 2 buses per hour x 12 hours = 24 buses that leave the station.
4) The question asks for the number of buses that leave the station for 5 days.
5) So we take the number of buses per day (24) and multiply it by the number of days (5).
6) 24 buses per day x 5 days = 120 buses.

Answer: 120
