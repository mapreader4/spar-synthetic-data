Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The race lasts for 12 minutes
* The winner ran 24 laps around the school
* Each lap is 100 meters
* The winner is awarded $3.5 for every 100 meters they run

First, we need to calculate the total distance the winner ran:
* 24 laps x 100 meters per lap = 2,400 meters

Next, we need to calculate the total amount the winner earned:
* 2,400 meters / 100 meters per $3.5 = 24 x $3.5 = $84

Finally, to find the average amount earned per minute, we divide the total amount earned by the time of the race:
* $84 / 12 minutes = $7 per minute

Answer: $7 per minute
