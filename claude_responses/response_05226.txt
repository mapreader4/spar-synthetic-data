Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The party venue has 4 tables that seat 6 people each.
   * Total capacity of these 4 tables = 4 * 6 = 24 people

2) The party venue has 16 tables that seat 4 people each.
   * Total capacity of these 16 tables = 16 * 4 = 64 people

3) The party venue has 8 round tables that seat 10 people each.
   * Total capacity of these 8 round tables = 8 * 10 = 80 people

4) To calculate the total capacity of all the tables, we add up the capacities from the 3 types of tables:
   * Total capacity = 24 + 64 + 80 = 168 people

Answer: 168
