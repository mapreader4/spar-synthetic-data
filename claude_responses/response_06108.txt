Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's apartment.
2) Grant's apartment has 1/9 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment.
3) Grant's apartment has 2 rooms.
4) Since Grant's apartment has 1/9 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment, and Grant's apartment has 2 rooms, we can calculate the number of rooms in Heidi's apartment:
* Grant's apartment has 1/9 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment
* So Heidi's apartment has 9 times as many rooms as Grant's apartment
* Heidi's apartment has 9 * 2 = 18 rooms
5) Since Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's apartment, we can calculate the number of rooms in Danielle's apartment:
* Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's apartment
* So Danielle's apartment has 1/3 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment
* Danielle's apartment has 18 / 3 = 6 rooms
