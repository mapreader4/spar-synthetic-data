Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Grandma Olga has 3 daughters and 3 sons
* Each of her 3 daughters has 6 sons
* So the number of grandsons from her daughters is:
  - 3 daughters x 6 sons each = 18 grandsons
* Each of her 3 sons has 5 daughters
* So the number of granddaughters from her sons is:
  - 3 sons x 5 daughters each = 15 granddaughters
* To get the total number of grandchildren, we add the number of grandsons and granddaughters:
  - 18 grandsons + 15 granddaughters = 33 grandchildren

Answer: 33
