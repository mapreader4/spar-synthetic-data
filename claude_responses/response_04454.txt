Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are three walls that will be completely covered in glass.
* The first two walls are 30 feet by 12 feet.
* The area of each of these walls is 30 feet x 12 feet = 360 square feet.
* The third wall is 20 feet by 12 feet.
* The area of this wall is 20 feet x 12 feet = 240 square feet.
* To calculate the total area of glass needed, we add the areas of the three walls:
* 360 square feet + 360 square feet + 240 square feet = 960 square feet.

Answer: 960 square feet.
