Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The garage has 2 cars, and each car has 4 wheels, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 wheels for the cars.
* There is a riding lawnmower, which typically has 4 wheels.
* There are 3 bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 wheels, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 wheels for the bicycles.
* There is a tricycle, which has 3 wheels.
* There is a unicycle, which has 1 wheel.
* Adding up all the wheels:
  - 8 wheels for the cars
  - 4 wheels for the lawnmower
  - 6 wheels for the bicycles
  - 3 wheels for the tricycle
  - 1 wheel for the unicycle
* The total number of wheels is 8 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 22 wheels.

Answer: 22
