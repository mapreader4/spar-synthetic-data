Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Markus is twice the age of his son
* Markus's son is twice the age of Markus's grandson
* The sum of the ages of Markus, his son, and his grandson is 140 years

Let's represent the ages as follows:
* Markus's age = x
* Markus's son's age = x/2
* Markus's grandson's age = (x/2)/2 = x/4

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
* x + x/2 + x/4 = 140
* x + 0.5x + 0.25x = 140
* 1.75x = 140
* x = 80

So, Markus is 80 years old.

Now, we can calculate the age of Markus's grandson:
* Markus's grandson's age = x/4 = 80/4 = 20

Answer: 20 years old.
