Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Rick is 15 years old
* His oldest brother is twice his age, so the oldest brother is 2 * 15 = 30 years old
* The middle brother is a third of the oldest brother's age, so the middle brother is 30 / 3 = 10 years old
* The smallest brother is half the middle brother's age, so the smallest brother is 10 / 2 = 5 years old
* The youngest brother is 2 years younger than the smallest brother, so the youngest brother is 5 - 2 = 3 years old
