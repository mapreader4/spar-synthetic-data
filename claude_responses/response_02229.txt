Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Zainab earns $2 per hour passing out flyers
* She passes out flyers on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday each week
* She passes out flyers for 4 hours at a time
* She does this for 4 weeks

First, let's calculate how much she earns per day:
* 4 hours x $2 per hour = $8 per day

Next, let's calculate how much she earns per week:
* 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday) x $8 per day = $24 per week

Finally, let's calculate how much she earns over the 4 weeks:
* $24 per week x 4 weeks = $96

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: $96
