Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John gets his pool cleaned every 3 days
* The cost of the cleaning is $150 each time
* He gives a 10% tip each time the pool is cleaned
* He needs to use $200 of chemicals twice a month

First, let's calculate the cost of the cleaning and tip per month:
* There are 30 days in a month
* John gets his pool cleaned every 3 days, so that's 10 times a month
* The cost of the cleaning is $150 each time
* The 10% tip is $15 each time
* So the total cost of the cleaning and tip per month is:
  * 10 x ($150 + $15) = 10 x $165 = $1,650

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chemicals per month:
* John needs to use $200 of chemicals twice a month
* So the total cost of the chemicals per month is:
  * 2 x $200 = $400

Now, let's add up the total cost per month:
* Cost of cleaning and tip per month: $1,650
* Cost of chemicals per month: $400
* Total cost per month: $1,650 + $400 = $2,050

Answer: $2,050
