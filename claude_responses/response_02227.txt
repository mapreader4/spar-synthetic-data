Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jen played the shooting game twice
* Each shooting game costs 5 tickets
* So for the shooting game, Jen used 2 x 5 = 10 tickets
* Russel rode the carousel three times
* Each carousel ride costs 3 tickets
* So for the carousel, Russel used 3 x 3 = 9 tickets
* To find the total number of tickets used, we add the tickets used for the shooting game and the carousel:
* 10 tickets (shooting game) + 9 tickets (carousel) = 19 tickets

Answer: 19
