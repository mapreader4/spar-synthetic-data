Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kay has 14 siblings.
2) Kay is 32 years old.
3) The youngest sibling is 5 less than half Kay's age.
   * Kay's age is 32 years.
   * Half of 32 is 16.
   * 16 - 5 = 11 years old.
4) The oldest sibling is four times as old as the youngest sibling.
   * The youngest sibling is 11 years old.
   * 4 x 11 = 44 years old.

Answer: 44
