Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Officer A patrols 36 streets in 4 hours
* So, Officer A patrols 36 / 4 = 9 streets per hour
* Officer B patrols 55 streets in 5 hours
* So, Officer B patrols 55 / 5 = 11 streets per hour
* In 1 hour, Officer A will patrol 9 streets and Officer B will patrol 11 streets
* Therefore, the total number of streets both officers will patrol in one hour is:
* 9 + 11 = 20 streets

Answer: 20
