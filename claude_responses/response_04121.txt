Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 20% of the milk bottles are spoiled, so 80% of the milk bottles are fresh.
* 60% of the eggs are rotten, so 40% of the eggs are fresh.
* 1/4 of the flour canisters have weevils, so 3/4 of the flour canisters are good.

To find the odds that all three ingredients will be good, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ingredient being good:
* Probability of good milk = 0.80
* Probability of good egg = 0.40
* Probability of good flour = 0.75

Multiplying these probabilities:
* 0.80 * 0.40 * 0.75 = 0.24

Therefore, the odds that all three ingredients will be good is 0.24 or 24%.
