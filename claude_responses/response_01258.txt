Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There have been 15 "Where's Waldo?" books published
* Each book has 30 puzzles to find Waldo
* The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle

To find the total time it would take to find every Waldo, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of puzzles across all 15 books
2. Multiply the total number of puzzles by the average time it takes to find Waldo in a puzzle

Step 1: Calculating the total number of puzzles
* 15 books x 30 puzzles per book = 450 total puzzles

Step 2: Calculating the total time to find every Waldo
* 450 total puzzles x 3 minutes per puzzle = 1,350 minutes

Therefore, it would take 1,350 minutes to find every Waldo.

Answer: 1,350
