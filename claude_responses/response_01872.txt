Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first season, the birds fly from lake Jim to lake Disney, which is 50 miles apart.
* In the second season, the birds fly from lake Disney to lake London, which is 60 miles apart.
* To calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons, we need to add the distances of the two flights:
* Distance from lake Jim to lake Disney: 50 miles
* Distance from lake Disney to lake London: 60 miles
* Total distance traveled: 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles

Answer: 110
