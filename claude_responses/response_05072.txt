Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Erica sees 9 butterflies in the garden
* One-third of the 9 butterflies fly away
* To calculate one-third of 9, we can divide 9 by 3:
* 9 รท 3 = 3
* So, 3 butterflies fly away
* To find the number of butterflies left in the garden, we take the original 9 butterflies and subtract the 3 that flew away:
* 9 - 3 = 6
