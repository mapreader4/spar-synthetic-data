Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Nancy fills the aquarium halfway. The aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high. So the volume of the aquarium is 4 x 6 x 3 = 72 cubic feet.
2. Since Nancy fills it halfway, the initial amount of water in the aquarium is 72 / 2 = 36 cubic feet.
3. Nancy's cat knocks over the aquarium and spills half the water, so the amount of water remaining is 36 / 2 = 18 cubic feet.
4. Nancy then triples the amount of water in the aquarium, so the final amount of water is 18 x 3 = 54 cubic feet.

Answer: 54 cubic feet.
