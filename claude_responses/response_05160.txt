Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lily bought 20 ducks and 10 geese.
2) Rayden bought three times as many ducks as Lily, so Rayden bought 3 * 20 = 60 ducks.
3) Rayden bought four times as many geese as Lily, so Rayden bought 4 * 10 = 40 geese.
4) The total number of ducks and geese Rayden bought is 60 + 40 = 100.
5) The total number of ducks and geese Lily bought is 20 + 10 = 30.
6) The difference between the number of ducks and geese Rayden has and the number of ducks and geese Lily has is 100 - 30 = 70.

Answer: 70
