Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Lionel bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos.
2) To make one Oreo cheesecake, Lionel needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos.
3) The maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes Lionel can make is determined by the limiting ingredient, which in this case is the Oreos.
4) Lionel has 15 packets of Oreos, and each cheesecake requires 3 packets, so he can make a maximum of 15 / 3 = 5 Oreo cheesecakes.
5) Each Oreo cheesecake requires 2 boxes of Graham crackers, so Lionel will use a total of 5 * 2 = 10 boxes of Graham crackers.
6) Lionel originally bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers, so the number of boxes of Graham crackers he has left over is 14 - 10 = 4.
