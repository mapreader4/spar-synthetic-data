Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there was 1 dandelion seed that landed on Mrs. Middleton's lawn and began to grow.
* After 1 month, this plant had grown to full size and developed a flower.
* At the end of the second month, the flower turned into 50 fluffy, white seeds.
* Only half of these 50 seeds (25 seeds) landed on good soil, germinated, and began to grow.
* Each of these 25 new seedling plants will produce the same number of seeds in the same amount of time as the original plant.
* So, each of the 25 new plants will produce 50 seeds in two months' time.
* Therefore, the total number of seeds that these newest plants will produce in two months' time is:
25 plants x 50 seeds per plant = 1,250 seeds

Answer: 1,250
