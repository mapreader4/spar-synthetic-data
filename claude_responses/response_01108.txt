Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Anton has three times as many cards as Heike.
2) Ann has six times as many cards as Heike.
3) Ann has 60 cards.
4) Since Ann has six times as many cards as Heike, we can divide 60 by 6 to find out how many cards Heike has:
60 / 6 = 10 cards
5) Since Anton has three times as many cards as Heike, we can multiply 10 by 3 to find out how many cards Anton has:
10 * 3 = 30 cards
6) Now we can find out how many more cards Ann has than Anton by subtracting Anton's cards from Ann's cards:
60 - 30 = 30 cards

Answer: 30
