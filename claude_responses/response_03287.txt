Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason is hiring 2 construction workers, 1 electrician, and 1 plumber
* Each construction worker makes $100/day
* The electrician makes double what a construction worker makes
* The plumber makes 250% of a construction worker's salary

First, let's calculate the daily pay for each worker:
* Construction worker: $100/day
* Electrician: 2 x $100 = $200/day
* Plumber: 2.5 x $100 = $250/day

Now, we can calculate the total labor costs for one day:
* 2 construction workers: 2 x $100 = $200
* 1 electrician: $200
* 1 plumber: $250
* Total labor costs: $200 + $200 + $250 = $650

Answer: $650
