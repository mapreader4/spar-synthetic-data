Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Teagan saved 200 pennies. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we can convert the 200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:
200 pennies / 100 = 2 dollars

2. Rex has 100 nickels. Since there are 5 nickels in a dollar, we can convert the 100 nickels to dollars by dividing by 5:
100 nickels / 5 = 20 dollars

3. Toni has 330 dimes. Since there are 10 dimes in a dollar, we can convert the 330 dimes to dollars by dividing by 10:
330 dimes / 10 = 33 dollars

4. To find the total amount of money saved by the three kids, we add up the amounts:
2 dollars + 20 dollars + 33 dollars = 55 dollars

Answer: 55
