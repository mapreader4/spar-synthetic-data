Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Yesterday morning, Mrs. Lim got 68 gallons of milk.
2. Yesterday evening, Mrs. Lim got 82 gallons of milk.
3. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning, which means she got 68 - 18 = 50 gallons.
4. In total, Mrs. Lim had 68 + 82 + 50 = 200 gallons of milk.
5. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left.
6. This means she sold 200 - 24 = 176 gallons of milk.
7. Each gallon of milk costs $3.50.
8. Therefore, her revenue for the milk is 176 gallons x $3.50 per gallon = $616.

Answer: $616.
