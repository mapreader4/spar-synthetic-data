Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Parker was waiting to get into the bathroom at 2:30 pm
* Her oldest daughter used the bathroom for 45 minutes
* Her youngest daughter used the bathroom for 30 minutes
* Her husband used the bathroom for 20 minutes
* So the total time the bathroom was occupied before Mrs. Parker's turn was:
    - Oldest daughter: 45 minutes
    - Youngest daughter: 30 minutes
    - Husband: 20 minutes
    - Total: 45 + 30 + 20 = 95 minutes
* The family needs to leave the house by 5 pm
* Mrs. Parker was waiting to get into the bathroom at 2:30 pm
* So the total time available before they need to leave is 5 pm - 2:30 pm = 2.5 hours = 150 minutes
* Subtracting the 95 minutes the bathroom was occupied before Mrs. Parker's turn, she will have 150 - 95 = 55 minutes to use the bathroom.

Answer: 55 minutes
