Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bart gets 75 pieces of firewood from each tree he cuts down
* Bart burns 5 logs per day
* The time period is from November 1 through February 28
* To calculate the number of days in this time period:
  - November has 30 days
  - December has 31 days
  - January has 31 days
  - February has 28 days
* Total number of days = 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 = 120 days
* Bart burns 5 logs per day, so the total number of logs he burns is 5 * 120 = 600 logs
* Since each tree gives him 75 pieces of firewood, the number of trees he needs to cut down is:
  - 600 logs / 75 logs per tree = 8 trees
