Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, there were 15 boys in the class.
2) The number of girls was 20% greater than the number of boys. 
   * 20% of 15 is 3, so the initial number of girls was 15 + 3 = 18.
3) Later in the year, transfer students were admitted such that the number of girls doubled.
   * The new number of girls is 18 x 2 = 36.
4) The number of boys remained the same at 15.
5) To find the total number of students in the class now, we add the number of boys and girls:
   * 15 boys + 36 girls = 51 students.

Answer: 51
