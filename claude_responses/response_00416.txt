Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In mid-May, the river is 5 feet deep.
2) By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. So, the depth in mid-June is 5 feet + 10 feet = 15 feet.
3) By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. So, the depth in mid-July is 15 feet x 3 = 45 feet.

Answer: 45 feet
