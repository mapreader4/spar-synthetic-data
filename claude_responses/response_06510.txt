Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Rachel paints and records 4 videos at a time.
2. It takes her 1 hour to set up her painting supplies and camera.
3. She then records herself painting for 1 hour per painting, so for 4 paintings it takes 4 hours.
4. It takes her 1 hour to clean up after the painting session.
5. So the total time for the painting and recording process is 1 hour (setup) + 4 hours (painting) + 1 hour (cleanup) = 6 hours.
6. Each video then takes 1.5 hours to edit and post.
7. Since she produces 4 videos at a time, the total time for editing and posting is 4 * 1.5 hours = 6 hours.
8. Therefore, the total time it takes Rachel to produce a speed painting video is the time for the painting and recording process (6 hours) plus the time for editing and posting (6 hours), which is 12 hours.

Answer: 12 hours
