Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Isabella is twice as old as Antonio. This means that if Isabella's age is x, then Antonio's age is x/2.
2) In 18 months, Isabella will be 10 years old. This means that her current age is 10 - (18/12) = 8 years old.
3) Since Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, we can say that Antonio's current age is 8/2 = 4 years old.
4) To convert Antonio's age to months, we multiply 4 years by 12 months per year.

Answer: 48 months
