Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Monica brings $15 and Michelle brings $12, so they have a total of $27 to spend.
2) The cake costs $15, so they have $12 left to spend on soda.
3) Each bottle of soda costs $3 and has 12 servings, so they can afford 4 bottles of soda ($12 / $3 per bottle = 4 bottles).
4) With 4 bottles of soda, there are 4 * 12 = 48 total servings of soda.
5) There are 8 total guests, so each guest gets 48 / 8 = 6 servings of soda.
