Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 6 more white birds next to the cage than grey birds in the cage.
2) The number of grey birds in the cage is 40.
3) Therefore, the number of white birds next to the cage is 40 + 6 = 46.
4) After 10 minutes, half of the birds in the cage are freed and fly away.
5) The number of birds in the cage before the birds were freed is 40 (grey birds).
6) Half of 40 is 20, so 20 birds were freed and flew away.
7) The number of birds remaining in the cage is 40 - 20 = 20.
8) The number of white birds next to the cage is still 46.
9) The total number of birds remaining is 20 (in the cage) + 46 (white birds next to the cage) = 66.

Answer: 66
