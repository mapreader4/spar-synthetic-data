Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The blue weights are 2 pounds each
* Harry put 4 blue weights onto the bar
* So the total weight of the blue weights is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
* The green weights are 3 pounds each
* Harry put 5 green weights onto the bar
* So the total weight of the green weights is 5 * 3 = 15 pounds
* The bar itself weighs 2 pounds
* To calculate the total weight, we add the weights of the blue weights, green weights, and the bar:
* 8 pounds + 15 pounds + 2 pounds = 25 pounds

Answer: 25
