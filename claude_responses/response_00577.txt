Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 teams competing
* Each team has 10 members
* Each member needs 2 pairs of roller skates (1 for competition, 1 as backup)
* Each pair of skates needs 3 sets of laces

First, let's calculate the total number of pairs of skates needed:
* 4 teams x 10 members per team x 2 pairs of skates per member = 80 pairs of skates

Now, let's calculate the total number of sets of laces needed:
* 80 pairs of skates x 3 sets of laces per pair = 240 sets of laces

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 240
