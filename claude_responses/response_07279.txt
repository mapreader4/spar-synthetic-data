Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cattle breeder owns 52 dairy cows
* Each cow gives 1000 oz of milk per day
* To calculate the amount of milk produced per week, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount of milk produced per day by all 52 cows
2. Multiply the daily milk production by the number of days in a week (7)

Step 1: Total milk produced per day
* Each cow gives 1000 oz of milk per day
* There are 52 cows
* Total milk produced per day = 52 cows x 1000 oz/cow = 52,000 oz

Step 2: Total milk produced per week
* Total milk produced per day = 52,000 oz
* There are 7 days in a week
* Total milk produced per week = 52,000 oz/day x 7 days = 364,000 oz

Answer: 364,000 oz
