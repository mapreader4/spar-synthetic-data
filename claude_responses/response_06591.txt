Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gabe has 3 songs on his playlist
* "The Best Day" is 3 minutes long
* "Raise the Roof" is 2 minutes long
* "Rap Battle" is 3 minutes long
* The total duration of the playlist is:
    - "The Best Day" (3 minutes)
    - "Raise the Roof" (2 minutes)
    - "Rap Battle" (3 minutes)
    - Total = 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 minutes
* Gabe has a 40-minute ride to his wrestling match
* To find how many times Gabe can listen to the entire playlist, we divide the total ride time (40 minutes) by the total playlist duration (8 minutes):
    - 40 minutes / 8 minutes = 5
