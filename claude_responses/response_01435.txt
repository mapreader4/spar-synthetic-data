Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Harriett found 10 quarters
* Each quarter is worth $0.25
* So the value of the quarters is 10 x $0.25 = $2.50
* Harriett found 3 dimes
* Each dime is worth $0.10
* So the value of the dimes is 3 x $0.10 = $0.30
* Harriett found 3 nickels
* Each nickel is worth $0.05
* So the value of the nickels is 3 x $0.05 = $0.15
* Harriett found 5 pennies
* Each penny is worth $0.01
* So the value of the pennies is 5 x $0.01 = $0.05
* To calculate the total amount of money Harriett found, we add up the values of the quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies:
* $2.50 + $0.30 + $0.15 + $0.05 = $3.00
