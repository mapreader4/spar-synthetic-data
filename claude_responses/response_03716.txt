Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) John starts at an elevation of 400 feet.
2) He travels downward at a rate of 10 feet per minute.
3) He travels for 5 minutes.
4) To calculate his final elevation, we need to subtract the distance he traveled downward from his starting elevation.
5) The distance he traveled downward is 10 feet per minute x 5 minutes = 50 feet.
6) His starting elevation was 400 feet, and he traveled 50 feet downward.
7) Therefore, his final elevation is 400 feet - 50 feet = 350 feet.

Answer: 350
