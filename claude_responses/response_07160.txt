To solve this problem, we need to find the average speed when there is heavy traffic and when there is no traffic, and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- The distance to Jennie's son's house is 200 miles.
- The trip takes 5 hours when there is heavy traffic.
- The trip takes 4 hours when there is no traffic.

Step 1: Calculate the average speed when there is heavy traffic.
Average speed = Distance / Time
Average speed = 200 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 40 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the average speed when there is no traffic.
Average speed = Distance / Time
Average speed = 200 miles / 4 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the average speeds.
Difference in average speed = Average speed with no traffic - Average speed with heavy traffic
Difference in average speed = 50 miles per hour - 40 miles per hour
Difference in average speed = 10 miles per hour

Answer: 10 miles per hour
