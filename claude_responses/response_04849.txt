Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes 30 minutes to groom a poodle
* It takes half as much time to groom a terrier as it takes to groom a poodle
* So, it takes 15 minutes to groom a terrier (half of 30 minutes)
* The pet shop is grooming 3 poodles and 8 terriers
* To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for the poodles and the time for the terriers, then add them together

Time for poodles:
* 3 poodles x 30 minutes per poodle = 90 minutes

Time for terriers:
* 8 terriers x 15 minutes per terrier = 120 minutes

Total time:
* 90 minutes (poodles) + 120 minutes (terriers) = 210 minutes

Answer: 210
