Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, the bowl holds 18 peaches, with 4 of them being ripe.
* Every day, 2 more peaches ripen.
* On the third day, 3 peaches are eaten.

Now, let's calculate the number of ripe and unripe peaches after 5 days:
* Day 1: 4 ripe, 14 unripe
* Day 2: 6 ripe, 12 unripe
* Day 3: 8 ripe, 10 unripe (3 peaches eaten)
* Day 4: 10 ripe, 8 unripe
* Day 5: 12 ripe, 6 unripe

After 5 days, there are 12 ripe peaches and 6 unripe peaches.
The difference between ripe and unripe peaches is:
12 ripe - 6 unripe = 6 more ripe peaches than unripe peaches.

Answer: 6
