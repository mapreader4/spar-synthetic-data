Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maria gave a third of her money to her friend Isha.
2) She then gave half of what she gave to Isha to Florence.
3) Florence received three times as much money as Maria's cousin Rene.
4) Rene received $300.

Let's start by finding out how much Maria gave to Isha:
* If Maria gave a third of her money to Isha, then Isha received 1/3 of Maria's total money.

Next, let's find out how much Maria gave to Florence:
* Maria gave half of what she gave to Isha to Florence.
* So, Florence received 1/2 of 1/3 of Maria's total money.

Now, let's find out how much money Rene received:
* Florence received three times as much money as Rene.
* Rene received $300.
* So, Florence received 3 x $300 = $900.

Finally, let's add up the total amount of money Maria gave to her three friends:
* Isha received 1/3 of Maria's total money.
* Florence received 1/2 of 1/3 of Maria's total money.
* Rene received $300.
* So, the total amount of money Maria gave to her three friends is:
1/3 + (1/2 of 1/3) + $300 = 1/3 + 1/6 + $300 = 1/2 + $300 = $500.

Answer: $500.
