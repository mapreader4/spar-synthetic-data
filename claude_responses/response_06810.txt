Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brenda bakes 20 cakes a day.
2) She does this for 9 days.
3) So the total number of cakes she bakes is 20 cakes per day x 9 days = 180 cakes.
4) She then sells half of the cakes.
5) Half of 180 cakes is 90 cakes.
6) Therefore, the number of cakes left with Brenda is 180 cakes - 90 cakes = 90 cakes.

Answer: 90
