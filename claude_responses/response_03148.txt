Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that the pair of pants and shirt cost $100 total.
2) We also know that the pants and coat cost $244 total.
3) The coat costs 5 times as much as the shirt.
4) Let's call the cost of the shirt 'x'.
5) Then the cost of the coat is 5x.
6) The cost of the pants is (100 - x).
7) The cost of the pants and coat is $244, so (100 - x) + 5x = 244.
8) Solving this equation, we get x = $44.
9) Therefore, the cost of the coat is 5 * $44 = $220.

Answer: $220
