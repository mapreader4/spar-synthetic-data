Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that Jessica is six years older than Claire.
2) In two years, Claire will be 20 years old.
3) This means that currently, Claire is 18 years old (20 - 2 = 18).
4) Since Jessica is six years older than Claire, we can calculate Jessica's current age by adding 6 to Claire's current age.
5) Jessica's current age = Claire's current age + 6
6) Jessica's current age = 18 + 6 = 24

Answer: 24
