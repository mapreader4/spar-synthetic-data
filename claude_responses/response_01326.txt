Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gargamel bought 4 tires on sale for $75 each
* He saved a total of $36 on the tires
* We need to find the original price of each tire

To find the original price of each tire, we need to first find the total amount Gargamel would have paid without the discount.

The total amount Gargamel paid for the 4 tires on sale is:
* 4 tires x $75 per tire = $300

The total amount Gargamel would have paid without the discount is:
* $300 + $36 (the total amount saved) = $336

Now, to find the original price of each tire, we divide the total amount without the discount by the number of tires:
* $336 / 4 tires = $84 per tire

Therefore, the original price of each tire was $84.

Answer: 84
