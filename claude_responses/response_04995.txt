Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 20 hours of music a month
* The average length of a song is 3 minutes
* He buys each song for $0.50

First, we need to calculate the number of songs John buys in a month:
* 20 hours of music per month
* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* 20 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 1,200 minutes of music per month
* 1,200 minutes / 3 minutes per song = 400 songs per month

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the music per month:
* 400 songs per month x $0.50 per song = $200 per month

Finally, to calculate the cost per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 months:
* $200 per month x 12 months = $2,400 per year

Answer: $2,400
