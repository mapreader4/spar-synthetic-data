Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have the bowling scores for Gretchen (120), Mitzi (113), and Beth (85).
2) To calculate the average, we need to add up the scores and divide by the number of people.
3) The total score is 120 + 113 + 85 = 318.
4) There are 3 people, so we divide the total score by 3 to get the average.
5) 318 / 3 = 106.

Answer: 106
