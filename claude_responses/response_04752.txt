Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jill has a total of 20 nails (10 toenails and 10 fingernails)
* 6 of the nails are painted purple
* 8 of the nails are painted blue
* The remaining nails are painted striped

First, let's calculate the percentage of nails painted blue:
* 8 out of 20 nails are painted blue
* 8/20 = 0.4 = 40%

Next, let's calculate the percentage of nails painted striped:
* The remaining nails are painted striped
* 20 - 6 - 8 = 6 nails are painted striped
* 6/20 = 0.3 = 30%

Finally, to find the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped, we subtract:
* 40% - 30% = 10 percentage points

Answer: 10
