Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Early Bird Dinner offers meals at half off the menu price if you eat between 2-4 pm.
2) Curtis ordered the Salisbury Steak that costs $16.00.
3) Since they ate at 3 pm, which is during the Early Bird Dinner hours, the cost of the Salisbury Steak is half off the menu price.
4) Half of $16.00 is $8.00, so the cost of the Salisbury Steak is $8.00.
5) Rob ordered the Chicken Fried Steak at $18.00.
6) Since they ate at 3 pm, which is during the Early Bird Dinner hours, the cost of the Chicken Fried Steak is also half off the menu price.
7) Half of $18.00 is $9.00, so the cost of the Chicken Fried Steak is $9.00.
8) To calculate the total bill, we add the cost of the Salisbury Steak ($8.00) and the Chicken Fried Steak ($9.00).

Answer: $17.00
