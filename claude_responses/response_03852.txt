Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has 10 machines
* Each machine requires 30 ball bearings
* So the total number of ball bearings needed is 10 machines x 30 ball bearings per machine = 300 ball bearings
* The normal cost per ball bearing is $1
* During the sale, the cost per ball bearing is $0.75
* Additionally, John gets a 20% discount for buying in bulk
* To calculate the normal cost:
    - 300 ball bearings x $1 per ball bearing = $300
* To calculate the sale price:
    - 300 ball bearings x $0.75 per ball bearing = $225
* To calculate the 20% bulk discount:
    - $225 x 0.8 (100% - 20%) = $180
* To calculate the savings:
    - $300 (normal cost) - $180 (sale price with bulk discount) = $120

Answer: $120
