Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John was only able to get 3 hours of sleep on 2 of the days
* On the remaining days, he was only able to get 60% of the recommended 8 hours of sleep
* To calculate the total sleep he got this week, we need to add up the sleep he got on the 2 days he got 3 hours, and the sleep he got on the remaining days.

For the 2 days he got 3 hours of sleep:
* 2 days x 3 hours = 6 hours

For the remaining days:
* 8 hours (recommended) x 0.6 (60%) = 4.8 hours per day
* 5 days (remaining) x 4.8 hours = 24 hours

Now, we add the two together:
* 6 hours + 24 hours = 30 hours

Therefore, the total amount of sleep John got this week is:
Answer: 30 hours
