Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The show has 90 episodes, and each episode is 20 minutes long.
2) To find the total duration of the show, we multiply the number of episodes (90) by the duration of each episode (20 minutes):
90 episodes x 20 minutes per episode = 1,800 minutes
3) Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total duration from minutes to hours:
1,800 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 30 hours
4) Tom can spend 2 hours per day watching the show.
5) To find how many days it will take Tom to finish watching the show, we divide the total duration (30 hours) by the daily viewing time (2 hours per day):
30 hours / 2 hours per day = 15 days

Answer: 15 days
