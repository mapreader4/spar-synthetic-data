Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wendy spent 25 years as an accountant
* Wendy spent 15 years as an accounting manager
* Wendy lived to be 80 years old

To calculate the percentage of her life she spent in an accounting-related job, we need to add up the total number of years she spent in accounting-related jobs and divide that by her total lifespan.

The total number of years she spent in accounting-related jobs is:
* 25 years as an accountant + 15 years as an accounting manager = 40 years

Her total lifespan was 80 years.

To calculate the percentage, we divide the number of years in accounting-related jobs by her total lifespan and multiply by 100:
* (40 years / 80 years) x 100 = 50%

Answer: 50
