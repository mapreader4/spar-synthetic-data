Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Chester originally had to deliver 10 bales of hay to Farmer Brown.
2) Farmer Brown wants Chester to supply better quality hay and double the delivery of bales of hay.
3) The previous hay cost $15 per bale.
4) The better quality hay costs $18 per bale.
5) To calculate the original cost of the 10 bales of hay:
   - 10 bales x $15 per bale = $150
6) Now, Farmer Brown wants double the amount of bales, which is 20 bales.
7) The cost of the 20 bales of better quality hay:
   - 20 bales x $18 per bale = $360
8) To calculate the difference in cost:
   - $360 (new cost) - $150 (original cost) = $210

Answer: $210
