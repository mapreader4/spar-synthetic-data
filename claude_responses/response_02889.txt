Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total number of guests invited is 200.
* 83% of the guests RSVP'd with a Yes response.
* To calculate the number of guests who RSVP'd Yes, we take 83% of 200:
    * 83% of 200 = 0.83 * 200 = 166 guests
* 9% of the guests RSVP'd with a No response.
* To calculate the number of guests who RSVP'd No, we take 9% of 200:
    * 9% of 200 = 0.09 * 200 = 18 guests
* To calculate the number of guests who did not respond at all, we need to subtract the number of Yes and No responses from the total number of guests:
    * Total guests - Yes responses - No responses = 200 - 166 - 18 = 16 guests

Answer: 16
