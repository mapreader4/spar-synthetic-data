Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James's primary care doctor charges $300 for the visit
* James's insurance covers 80% of the cost
* To calculate James's out-of-pocket cost, we need to find the amount that is not covered by insurance

First, we calculate the amount covered by insurance:
* 80% of $300 = 0.8 * $300 = $240

Now, we can calculate James's out-of-pocket cost by subtracting the amount covered by insurance from the total cost:
* $300 - $240 = $60

Answer: $60
