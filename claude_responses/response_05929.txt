Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 2 bananas in the bowl
* There are twice as many apples as bananas, so there are 2 x 2 = 4 apples in the bowl
* The total number of fruits in the bowl is 12
* We know the number of bananas (2) and the number of apples (4)
* To find the number of oranges, we need to subtract the number of bananas and apples from the total number of fruits:
* Total fruits = 12
* Bananas = 2
* Apples = 4
* Oranges = Total fruits - Bananas - Apples
* Oranges = 12 - 2 - 4 = 6
