Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ken is buying 2 pounds of steak at $7 per pound.
2) To calculate the total cost of the steak, we multiply the price per pound ($7) by the number of pounds (2):
   2 pounds x $7 per pound = $14
3) Ken paid with a $20 bill.
4) To calculate the amount of money he will get back, we subtract the total cost of the steak ($14) from the amount he paid ($20):
   $20 - $14 = $6

Answer: $6
