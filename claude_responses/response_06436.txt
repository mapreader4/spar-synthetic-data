Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Layla won the game with 70 points
* The total number of points scored was 112
* To find how many more points Layla scored than Nahima, we need to find Nahima's score and then subtract it from Layla's score.

To find Nahima's score, we can use the total points scored:
* Total points scored = Layla's score + Nahima's score
* 112 = 70 + Nahima's score
* Nahima's score = 112 - 70 = 42

Now, to find how many more points Layla scored than Nahima, we subtract Nahima's score from Layla's score:
* Layla's score - Nahima's score = 70 - 42 = 28

Answer: 28
