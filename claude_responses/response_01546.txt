Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* If the woman drives herself, the trip will take 3 hours and 15 minutes, which is 195 minutes.
* If she takes the airplane, the steps are:
  1. Drive 10 minutes to the airport
  2. Wait 20 minutes to board the plane
  3. Fly for one-third of the driving time, which is 195 / 3 = 65 minutes
  4. Spend an additional 10 minutes getting off the plane and arriving at the interview site
* So the total time for the airplane trip is:
  10 minutes + 20 minutes + 65 minutes + 10 minutes = 105 minutes

Now, to calculate how much faster the airplane is:
* Driving time: 195 minutes
* Airplane time: 105 minutes
* Difference: 195 minutes - 105 minutes = 90 minutes

Answer: 90 minutes
