Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 9 wombats in the enclosure
* Each wombat claws Carson 4 times
* So the total number of times the wombats claw Carson is:
9 wombats x 4 claws per wombat = 36 claws

* There are 3 rheas in the enclosure
* Each rhea claws Carson once
* So the total number of times the rheas claw Carson is:
3 rheas x 1 claw per rhea = 3 claws

* To get the total number of times Carson gets clawed, we add the number of wombat claws and the number of rhea claws:
36 wombat claws + 3 rhea claws = 39 claws

Answer: 39
