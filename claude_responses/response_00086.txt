Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The soda costs $0.25 per ounce.
2) Peter brought $2 with him to the store.
3) He leaves with $0.50.
4) To find the amount of soda he bought, we need to calculate the difference between the amount he brought and the amount he left with.
5) $2 - $0.50 = $1.50
6) Since the soda costs $0.25 per ounce, we can divide the $1.50 he spent by $0.25 to find the number of ounces he bought.
7) $1.50 / $0.25 = 6 ounces.
