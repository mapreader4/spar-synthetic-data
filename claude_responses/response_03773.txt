Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The packet of candy sweets has:
    - 30 cherry-flavored sweets
    - 40 strawberry-flavored sweets
    - 50 pineapple-flavored sweets
* Aaron eats half of each of the flavored sweets, so:
    - He eats 15 cherry-flavored sweets (half of 30)
    - He eats 20 strawberry-flavored sweets (half of 40)
    - He eats 25 pineapple-flavored sweets (half of 50)
* Aaron then gives 5 cherry-flavored sweets to his friend, so there are now:
    - 30 - 15 - 5 = 10 cherry-flavored sweets left
    - 40 - 20 = 20 strawberry-flavored sweets left
    - 50 - 25 = 25 pineapple-flavored sweets left

Answer: 10 + 20 + 25 = 55 sweets are still in the packet of candy.
