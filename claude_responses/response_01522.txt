Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recipe requires 3 eggs for every 2 cups of flour
* The baker has 6 cups of flour remaining
* To find the number of eggs needed, we need to determine the ratio of eggs to flour in the recipe
* The ratio of eggs to flour is 3:2, which means for every 2 cups of flour, 3 eggs are needed
* To find the number of eggs needed for 6 cups of flour, we can set up a proportion:
* 2 cups of flour : 3 eggs = 6 cups of flour : x eggs
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = (6 * 3) / 2 = 9 eggs
