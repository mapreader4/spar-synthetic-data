Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jimmy's father originally received 20 emails per day
* Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day
* So, for the first half of the month (15 days), he received 20 emails per day
* For the second half of the month (15 days), he received 25 emails per day (20 + 5)
* To calculate the total number of emails:
** For the first 15 days: 20 emails/day x 15 days = 300 emails
** For the last 15 days: 25 emails/day x 15 days = 375 emails
** Total emails = 300 + 375 = 675 emails

Answer: 675
