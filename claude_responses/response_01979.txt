Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Val cuts a single watermelon into 40 slices.
2) Each slice has 20 black seeds and 20 white seeds.
3) To find the total number of seeds in the watermelon, we need to multiply the number of slices by the number of seeds per slice.
4) The number of seeds per slice is 20 black seeds + 20 white seeds = 40 seeds.
5) The total number of seeds in the watermelon is 40 slices x 40 seeds per slice = 1,600 seeds.

Answer: 1,600
