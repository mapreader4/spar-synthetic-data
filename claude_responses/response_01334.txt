Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rachel has 8 hours to complete the task of stuffing 1,500 envelopes
* In the first hour, she stuffed 135 envelopes
* In the second hour, she stuffed 141 envelopes
* So in the first 2 hours, she has stuffed 135 + 141 = 276 envelopes
* That means she has 1,500 - 276 = 1,224 envelopes left to stuff
* She has 8 - 2 = 6 hours left to stuff the remaining 1,224 envelopes
* To calculate the number of envelopes she needs to stuff per hour, we divide the remaining envelopes (1,224) by the remaining hours (6)
* 1,224 / 6 = 204 envelopes per hour

Answer: 204
