Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Big Dig Mining Company mines three different types of ore: copper, iron, and nickel.
2) 10% of their total output is nickel, and they mine 720 tons of nickel a day.
3) 60% of their total output is iron.
4) The remaining percentage must be copper.
5) To find the amount of copper mined daily, we need to find the total output and then subtract the nickel and iron amounts.
6) The total output can be calculated by taking the nickel output (720 tons) and dividing it by 10% (0.10), since nickel is 10% of the total output.
7) Total output = 720 tons / 0.10 = 7,200 tons per day.
8) Iron output is 60% of the total, so iron output = 7,200 * 0.60 = 4,320 tons per day.
9) Copper output is the remaining percentage, which is 100% - 10% (nickel) - 60% (iron) = 30%.
10) Copper output = 7,200 * 0.30 = 2,160 tons per day.

Answer: 2,160 tons
