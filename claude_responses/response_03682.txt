Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Gail has a total of $100 in her wallet
* She has 4 $5 bills, which is 4 x $5 = $20
* She has 3 $20 bills, which is 3 x $20 = $60
* The total amount from the $5 and $20 bills is $20 + $60 = $80
* The remaining amount must be in $10 bills
* To find the number of $10 bills, we take the total amount ($100) and subtract the amount from the $5 and $20 bills ($80)
* $100 - $80 = $20
* Since each $10 bill is worth $10, we divide the remaining $20 by $10 to get the number of $10 bills
* $20 / $10 = 2
