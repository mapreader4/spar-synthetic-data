Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim spends 1 hour a day meditating
* He spends twice as much time reading as he does meditating
* To find the time he spends reading per day, we multiply the time he spends meditating (1 hour) by 2:
* 1 hour x 2 = 2 hours
* Now, to find the time he spends reading per week, we multiply the time he spends reading per day (2 hours) by 7 days:
* 2 hours x 7 days = 14 hours

Answer: 14 hours
