Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Samuel has $5, $10, and $20 bills in his wallet
* The total amount in his wallet is $150
* The $10-bills amount to $50, which means he has 5 $10-bills
* He has 4 $20-bills
* Now we need to find the number of $5-bills he has
* The total amount of $5, $10, and $20 bills is $150
* We know the $10-bills amount to $50 and the $20-bills amount to $80 (4 x $20)
* So the remaining amount must be from the $5-bills
* $150 - $50 - $80 = $20
* Since each $5-bill is worth $5, the number of $5-bills he has is $20 / $5 = 4
* Therefore, Samuel has a total of 5 $10-bills, 4 $20-bills, and 4 $5-bills in his wallet.
