Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 20 candy bars
* Each candy bar costs $1.50
* Dave pays for 6 of the candy bars

To calculate how much John paid, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the 20 candy bars:
   * 20 candy bars x $1.50 per candy bar = $30 total
2. Subtract the cost of the 6 candy bars that Dave paid for:
   * $30 total - (6 candy bars x $1.50 per candy bar) = $30 - $9 = $21

Therefore, the amount John paid is:
Answer: $21
