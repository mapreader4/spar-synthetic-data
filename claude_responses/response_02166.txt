Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The wheel makes 6 turns every 30 seconds
* We want to know how many turns it makes in two hours
* There are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour
* So in one hour, there are 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds
* In two hours, there are 2 x 3600 = 7200 seconds
* Since the wheel makes 6 turns every 30 seconds, we can calculate the number of turns in 7200 seconds as follows:
* 7200 seconds / 30 seconds per 6 turns = 240 sets of 6 turns
* 240 sets of 6 turns = 240 x 6 = 1440 turns

Answer: 1440
