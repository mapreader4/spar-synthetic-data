Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sammy has 2 more bottle caps than Janine.
2) Janine has 3 times as many bottle caps as Billie.
3) Billie has 2 bottle caps.

First, let's find out how many bottle caps Janine has:
* Janine has 3 times as many bottle caps as Billie.
* Billie has 2 bottle caps.
* Therefore, Janine has 3 x 2 = 6 bottle caps.

Now, let's find out how many bottle caps Sammy has:
* Sammy has 2 more bottle caps than Janine.
* Janine has 6 bottle caps.
* Therefore, Sammy has 6 + 2 = 8 bottle caps.
