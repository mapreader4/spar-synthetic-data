Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lavinia's daughter is 10 years younger than Katie's daughter.
2) Katie's daughter is 12 years old.
3) Therefore, Lavinia's daughter is 12 - 10 = 2 years old.
4) Lavinia's son is 2 times the age of Katie's daughter.
5) Katie's daughter is 12 years old.
6) Therefore, Lavinia's son is 2 * 12 = 24 years old.
7) The age difference between Lavinia's son and Lavinia's daughter is 24 - 2 = 22 years.

Answer: 22
