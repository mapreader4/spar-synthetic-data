Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The hotel has 10 rooms
* Each room holds a family of 3 people
* So the total number of people in the hotel is:
  * 10 rooms x 3 people per room = 30 people
* Each person receives 2 towels
* So the total number of towels handed out is:
  * 30 people x 2 towels per person = 60 towels

Answer: 60
