Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pizza was pre-sliced into 12 pieces
* John ate 3 slices
* Sam ate twice the amount that John ate, which means Sam ate 6 slices (2 x 3 = 6)
* To find the number of slices left, we need to subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices
* Total slices: 12
* Slices eaten by John: 3
* Slices eaten by Sam: 6
* Total slices eaten: 3 + 6 = 9
* Slices left: 12 - 9 = 3
