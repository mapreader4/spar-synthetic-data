Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cindy can run at 3 miles per hour
* Cindy can walk at 1 mile per hour
* She runs for half a mile
* To calculate the time it takes her to run half a mile:
  * Distance = 0.5 miles
  * Speed = 3 miles per hour
  * Time = Distance / Speed
  * Time = 0.5 miles / 3 miles per hour
  * Time = 0.167 hours
  * Converting to minutes: 0.167 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 10 minutes
* She then walks for half a mile
* To calculate the time it takes her to walk half a mile:
  * Distance = 0.5 miles
  * Speed = 1 mile per hour
  * Time = Distance / Speed
  * Time = 0.5 miles / 1 mile per hour
  * Time = 0.5 hours
  * Converting to minutes: 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes
* The total time is the sum of the running time and the walking time:
  * Total time = 10 minutes + 30 minutes = 40 minutes

Answer: 40 minutes
