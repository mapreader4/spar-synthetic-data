Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The stadium has a capacity of 60,000 seats.
2) 75% of the seats were sold for the music show.
3) To find the number of seats sold, we take 75% of 60,000:
   * 75% of 60,000 = 0.75 * 60,000 = 45,000 seats sold
4) However, 5,000 fans stayed home due to the threat of rain.
5) So the number of fans who attended the show is the number of seats sold minus the number of fans who stayed home:
   * 45,000 - 5,000 = 40,000 fans attended the show.

Answer: 40,000
