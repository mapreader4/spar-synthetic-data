Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Wilfred ate 4 carrots on Tuesday and 6 carrots on Wednesday.
2) The total number of carrots Wilfred wants to eat from Tuesday to Thursday is 15.
3) To find the number of carrots Wilfred needs to eat on Thursday, we need to subtract the number of carrots he ate on Tuesday and Wednesday from the total number of carrots he wants to eat.
4) 4 carrots (Tuesday) + 6 carrots (Wednesday) = 10 carrots
5) 15 carrots (total) - 10 carrots (Tuesday and Wednesday) = 5 carrots
