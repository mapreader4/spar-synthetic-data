Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total length of the newscast is 30 minutes
* The national news takes up 12 minutes
* The international news takes up 5 minutes
* The sports news takes up 5 minutes
* The weather forecast takes up 2 minutes
* The remaining time is for advertisements

To calculate the time for advertisements, we need to add up the time for the other segments and subtract that from the total time of the newscast:
* Total time = 30 minutes
* National news = 12 minutes
* International news = 5 minutes
* Sports news = 5 minutes
* Weather forecast = 2 minutes
* Total time for non-advertisement segments = 12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24 minutes
* Time for advertisements = 30 minutes - 24 minutes = 6 minutes

Answer: 6 minutes
