Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The recipe for 1 batch of cookies calls for 2 cups of flour.
2) Gigi bakes 3 batches of cookies.
3) So the total amount of flour used for the 3 batches is:
   3 batches x 2 cups of flour per batch = 6 cups of flour
4) Gigi's bag of flour contains 20 cups of flour.
5) The remaining amount of flour is:
   20 cups - 6 cups = 14 cups of flour
6) The recipe calls for 2 cups of flour per batch.
7) Therefore, the number of additional batches Gigi could make with the remaining 14 cups of flour is:
   14 cups of flour / 2 cups of flour per batch = 7 batches

Answer: 7
