Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Peggy has 200 records
2) Sammy offers to buy all 200 records for $4 each
   * Sammy's total offer = 200 records x $4 per record = $800
3) Bryan is interested in half of the records, so 100 records
   * Bryan offers $6 per record for the 100 records he is interested in
   * Bryan's offer for the 100 records he is interested in = 100 records x $6 per record = $600
   * Bryan offers $1 per record for the remaining 100 records he is not interested in
   * Bryan's offer for the 100 records he is not interested in = 100 records x $1 per record = $100
   * Bryan's total offer = $600 + $100 = $700
4) The difference in profit between Sammy's and Bryan's deals is:
   * Sammy's offer: $800
   * Bryan's offer: $700
   * Difference in profit = $800 - $700 = $100

Answer: $100
