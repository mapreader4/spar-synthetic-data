Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Randy spends $2 every time he goes to the store
* He goes to the store 4 times per month
* So, he spends $2 x 4 = $8 per month on these trips
* Over the course of a year (12 months), he would have spent $8 x 12 = $96
* At the end of the year, he had $104 left in his piggy bank
* To find the amount he had at first, we add the $96 he spent and the $104 he had left:
* $96 + $104 = $200

Answer: $200
