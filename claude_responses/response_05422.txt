Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We have 3 consecutive integers, which means the numbers are in the form x, x+1, x+2.
2) The sum of these 3 numbers is 18, so we can write the equation: x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 18.
3) Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 3 = 18.
4) Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get: 3x = 15.
5) Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 5.
6) Therefore, the 3 consecutive integers are 5, 6, and 7.
7) The largest of the 3 numbers is 7.

Answer: 7
