Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Young buys a 300 piece puzzle set
* She divides the pieces evenly among her three sons
* So each son gets 300 / 3 = 100 pieces
* Reyn can place 25 pieces into the puzzle
* Rhys places twice as much as Reyn, which is 2 * 25 = 50 pieces
* Rory places three times as much as Reyn, which is 3 * 25 = 75 pieces
* Now, we add up the pieces placed by all three sons:
  - Reyn: 25 pieces
  - Rhys: 50 pieces
  - Rory: 75 pieces
  - Total pieces placed: 25 + 50 + 75 = 150 pieces
* Finally, we subtract the total pieces placed from the total pieces in the puzzle to get the pieces still left to be placed:
  - Total pieces in puzzle: 300
  - Total pieces placed: 150
  - Pieces still left to be placed: 300 - 150 = 150

Answer: 150
