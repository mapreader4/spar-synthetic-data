To solve this problem, we need to find the total time William spent on the road, excluding the time spent at the stops.

Given information:
- William left Missouri at 7:00 AM.
- William arrived at his hometown at 8:00 PM.
- William had 3 stops of 25, 10, and 25 minutes, respectively.

Step 1: Calculate the total time of the journey.
Total time of the journey = 8:00 PM - 7:00 AM = 13 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent at the stops.
Time spent at the stops = 25 minutes + 10 minutes + 25 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour

Step 3: Calculate the time spent on the road.
Time spent on the road = Total time of the journey - Time spent at the stops
Time spent on the road = 13 hours - 1 hour = 12 hours

Answer: 12 hours
