Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anna gets 14 pieces of candy per house in the first subdivision
* The first subdivision has 60 houses
* So, the total number of pieces of candy Anna gets is:
    - 14 pieces per house x 60 houses = 840 pieces of candy
* Billy gets 11 pieces of candy per house in the second subdivision
* The second subdivision has 75 houses
* So, the total number of pieces of candy Billy gets is:
    - 11 pieces per house x 75 houses = 825 pieces of candy
* To find the difference, we subtract Billy's total from Anna's total:
    - 840 pieces of candy - 825 pieces of candy = 15 pieces of candy
