Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 cheerleaders who need a size 2
* There are a certain number of cheerleaders who need a size 6
* The number of cheerleaders who need a size 12 is half the number who need a size 6
* There are 19 cheerleaders total

To find the number of cheerleaders who need a size 6, we can set up an equation:
Let x = the number of cheerleaders who need a size 6
Then, the number of cheerleaders who need a size 12 is x/2

We know that the total number of cheerleaders is 19, so we can set up the equation:
4 + x + x/2 = 19

Solving for x:
4 + x + x/2 = 19
4 + 1.5x = 19
1.5x = 15
x = 10

Therefore, the number of cheerleaders who need a size 6 is 10.

Answer: 10
