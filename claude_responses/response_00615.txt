Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Connie's grandmother's older brother was born in 1932.
2) We know that Connie's grandmother's older sister was born in 1936.
3) We also know that the gap between Connie's grandmother and her sister is twice the gap between the older brother and the older sister.
4) Let's call the gap between the older brother and the older sister "x".
5) Then the gap between Connie's grandmother and her sister is 2x.
6) The older sister was born in 1936, so Connie's grandmother was born in 1936 - 2x.
7) We can calculate x by subtracting the year the older brother was born (1932) from the year the older sister was born (1936): x = 1936 - 1932 = 4.
8) So the year Connie's grandmother was born is 1936 - 2x = 1936 - 2(4) = 1928.

Answer: 1928
