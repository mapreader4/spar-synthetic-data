Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Helen hand washes her silk pillowcases every 4 weeks
* It takes her 30 minutes to hand wash all of them
* We need to find out how much time she spends hand washing her pillowcases in 1 year

First, we need to calculate how many times Helen will hand wash her pillowcases in 1 year:
* There are 52 weeks in a year
* Every 4 weeks, Helen hand washes her pillowcases
* 52 weeks / 4 weeks = 13 times

Now, we can calculate the total time spent hand washing her pillowcases in 1 year:
* 13 times x 30 minutes = 390 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
* 390 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 6.5 hours

Answer: 6 hours
