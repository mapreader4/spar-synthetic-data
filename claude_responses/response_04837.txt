Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Fern buys one pair of high heels for $60.
2) She also buys five pairs of ballet slippers.
3) The price of the ballet slippers is 2/3rds of the price of the high heels.
4) The price of the high heels is $60.
5) Therefore, the price of each pair of ballet slippers is 2/3 * $60 = $40.
6) Fern buys 5 pairs of ballet slippers, so the total cost of the ballet slippers is 5 * $40 = $200.
7) The total amount Fern pays is the cost of the high heels ($60) plus the cost of the ballet slippers ($200).
8) Therefore, the total amount Fern pays is $60 + $200 = $260.

Answer: 260
