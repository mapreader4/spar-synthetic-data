Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The superhero can run 10 miles in 4 minutes
* This means the superhero can run 2.5 miles per minute (10 miles / 4 minutes = 2.5 miles per minute)
* In 1 hour, the superhero can run 150 miles (2.5 miles per minute x 60 minutes = 150 miles)
* The supervillain's Evil-Mobile drives 100 miles per hour
* In 1 hour, the supervillain can drive 100 miles

Now, to find the difference:
* The superhero can run 150 miles in 1 hour
* The supervillain can drive 100 miles in 1 hour
* The difference is 150 miles - 100 miles = 50 miles

Answer: 50
