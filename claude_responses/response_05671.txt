Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Brooke has 15 math problems, 6 social studies problems, and 10 science problems
* Each math problem takes 2 minutes to answer
* Each social studies problem takes 30 seconds to answer
* Each science problem takes 1.5 minutes to answer

To calculate the total time it will take Brooke to answer all his homework:
* Math problems: 15 problems x 2 minutes per problem = 30 minutes
* Social studies problems: 6 problems x 0.5 minutes per problem = 3 minutes
* Science problems: 10 problems x 1.5 minutes per problem = 15 minutes

Now, we add up the time for each subject:
* Total time = 30 minutes + 3 minutes + 15 minutes = 48 minutes

Answer: 48 minutes
