Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary initially has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts
* She gives away half of her blue shirts
* Half of 26 is 13, so she gives away 13 blue shirts
* She has 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left
* She gives away a third of her brown shirts
* A third of 36 is 12, so she gives away 12 brown shirts
* She has 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left
* Adding the remaining blue and brown shirts:
* 13 blue shirts + 24 brown shirts = 37 shirts left

Answer: 37
