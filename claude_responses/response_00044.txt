Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James has a budget of $1000 per semester
* He spends 30% of his money on food
* He spends 15% of his money on accommodation
* He spends 25% of his money on entertainment
* The remaining percentage is spent on coursework materials

First, let's calculate the amounts spent on each category:
* Food: 30% of $1000 = 0.30 * $1000 = $300
* Accommodation: 15% of $1000 = 0.15 * $1000 = $150
* Entertainment: 25% of $1000 = 0.25 * $1000 = $250

Now, we can calculate the remaining amount spent on coursework materials:
* Total budget: $1000
* Amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment: $300 + $150 + $250 = $700
* Amount spent on coursework materials = Total budget - Amount spent on other categories
* Amount spent on coursework materials = $1000 - $700 = $300

Answer: $300
