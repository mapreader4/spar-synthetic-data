Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Stacy assigns 45 problems for homework
* There are twice as many multiple choice problems as free response problems
* There are 7 more free response problems than true/false problems

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of true/false problems
* Then the number of free response problems is x + 7
* And the number of multiple choice problems is 2(x + 7)

We know that the total number of problems is 45, so we can set up an equation:
* x + (x + 7) + 2(x + 7) = 45

Solving this equation:
* 4x + 28 = 45
* 4x = 17
* x = 4.25

Since we can't have a fractional number of true/false problems, we round down to the nearest integer.

Answer: 4
