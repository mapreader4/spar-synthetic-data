Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Daniel has 2 horses
* Each horse has 4 legs
* So the total number of legs for the horses is 2 x 4 = 8 legs

* Daniel has 5 dogs
* Each dog has 4 legs
* So the total number of legs for the dogs is 5 x 4 = 20 legs

* Daniel has 7 cats
* Each cat has 4 legs
* So the total number of legs for the cats is 7 x 4 = 28 legs

* Daniel has 3 turtles
* Each turtle has 4 legs
* So the total number of legs for the turtles is 3 x 4 = 12 legs

* Daniel has 1 goat
* Each goat has 4 legs
* So the total number of legs for the goat is 1 x 4 = 4 legs

Now, to find the total number of legs for all the animals, we add up the legs for each type of animal:
8 + 20 + 28 + 12 + 4 = 72 legs

Answer: 72
