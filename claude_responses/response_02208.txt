Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Steve needs 6 lengths of wood that measure 4 feet each
* To calculate the total length of these 6 pieces, we multiply 6 by 4 feet:
  * 6 x 4 feet = 24 feet
* Steve also needs 2 lengths of wood that measure 2 feet each
* To calculate the total length of these 2 pieces, we multiply 2 by 2 feet:
  * 2 x 2 feet = 4 feet
* To get the total amount of wood Steve needs to buy, we add the lengths of the two sets of wood:
  * 24 feet + 4 feet = 28 feet

Answer: 28 feet
