Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The regular rate for a mani/pedi is $40.00.
2) The salon is offering a 25% discount for Mother's day.
3) To calculate the discounted rate, we take the regular rate and subtract 25%:
   $40.00 - (25% of $40.00) = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00 per mani/pedi.
4) Charlotte is treating herself, her daughter, and 3 granddaughters, so that's a total of 5 mani/pedis.
5) To calculate the total cost, we multiply the discounted rate by the number of mani/pedis:
   $30.00 x 5 = $150.00.

Answer: $150
