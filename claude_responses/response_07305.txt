Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Originally, the number of dogs was half the number of cats in the neighborhood.
2) 20 new dogs were born, so the current number of dogs is the original number of dogs plus 20.
3) Now, there are twice as many dogs as cats.
4) There are 20 cats in the neighborhood currently.
5) Let's call the original number of cats 'x'.
6) Since the original number of dogs was half the number of cats, the original number of dogs was x/2.
7) Now, the number of dogs is twice the number of cats, so the current number of dogs is 2 * 20 = 40.
8) The original number of dogs was x/2, and 20 new dogs were born, so the current number of dogs is x/2 + 20 = 40.
9) Solving this equation, we get x = 40.

Answer: 40 cats were in the neighborhood originally.
