Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Johnny has two dogs
* Each dog has 4 legs
* So the two dogs have a total of 2 x 4 = 8 legs
* Johnny, as a human, has 2 legs
* Johnny's son, also a human, has 2 legs
* So the total number of legs is:
* 8 legs (from the two dogs)
* + 2 legs (from Johnny)
* + 2 legs (from Johnny's son)
* = 12 legs

Answer: 12
