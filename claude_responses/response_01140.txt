Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The basketball team played a total of 40 games
* They won 70% of those 40 games
* To calculate the number of games they won, we take 70% of 40:
    * 70% of 40 = 0.70 * 40 = 28 games won
* They still have 10 games left to play
* To win 60% of their total games, they need to win 60% of the total number of games they will play
* The total number of games they will play is 40 + 10 = 50
* 60% of 50 is 0.60 * 50 = 30 games
* Since they have already won 28 games, they need to win 30 - 28 = 2 more games
* Therefore, they can lose up to 10 - 2 = 8 of the remaining 10 games and still win 60% of their total games.
