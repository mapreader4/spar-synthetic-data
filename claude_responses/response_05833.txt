Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each shirt costs $5
* We need to buy 3 shirts
* So the cost of the 3 shirts is 3 x $5 = $15
* Each pair of jeans costs $10
* We need to buy 2 pairs of jeans
* So the cost of the 2 pairs of jeans is 2 x $10 = $20
* Each hat costs $4
* We need to buy 4 hats
* So the cost of the 4 hats is 4 x $4 = $16
* To calculate the total cost, we add up the costs of the shirts, jeans, and hats:
* $15 + $20 + $16 = $51
