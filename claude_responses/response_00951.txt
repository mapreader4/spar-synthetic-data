Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Michonne invites 6 friends from school and 12 friends from her neighborhood, for a total of 18 friends.
2) Each of these 18 friends asks to bring 2 additional friends.
3) So the total number of additional friends is 18 * 2 = 36.
4) The total number of people going to the party is the 18 friends Michonne invited, plus the 36 additional friends, for a total of 18 + 36 = 54 people.

Answer: 54
