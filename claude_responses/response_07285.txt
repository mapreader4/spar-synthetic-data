Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 20 students in the orchestra
* There are twice as many students in the band as in the orchestra, so there are 2 x 20 = 40 students in the band
* There are 12 boys and 16 girls in the choir, so there are 12 + 16 = 28 students in the choir
* Each student only participates in one group, so we can add up the total number of students in each group:
* 20 students in the orchestra
* 40 students in the band
* 28 students in the choir
* Total number of students = 20 + 40 + 28 = 88

Answer: 88
