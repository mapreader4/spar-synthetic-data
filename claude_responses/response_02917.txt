Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We have two piles of toys that add up to 120 toys in total.
2) The larger pile is twice as big as the smaller pile.
3) Let's represent the smaller pile as x and the larger pile as 2x.
4) We know that the total number of toys is 120, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x = 120
5) Simplifying this equation, we get:
3x = 120
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = 40
7) Since the larger pile is 2x, we can calculate the number of toys in the larger pile:
2x = 2 * 40 = 80

Answer: 80
