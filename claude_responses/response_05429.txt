Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Miss Davis gave 15 popsicle sticks to each of the 10 groups in her class.
2) To calculate the total number of popsicle sticks given to the groups, we multiply 15 (sticks per group) by 10 (number of groups):
15 x 10 = 150 popsicle sticks given to the groups.
3) We know that Miss Davis had 170 popsicle sticks to start with.
4) To find the number of popsicle sticks left, we subtract the number of sticks given to the groups (150) from the total number of sticks (170):
170 - 150 = 20 popsicle sticks left.

Answer: 20
