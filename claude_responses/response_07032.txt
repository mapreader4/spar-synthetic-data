Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Chris buys 2 and a half dozen donuts. 
   * 2 and a half dozen = 2.5 x 12 = 30 donuts

2. While driving, he eats 10% of the donuts.
   * 10% of 30 donuts = 0.10 x 30 = 3 donuts

3. After eating 3 donuts, he has 30 - 3 = 27 donuts left.

4. He then grabs another 4 donuts for his afternoon snack.
   * 27 - 4 = 23 donuts left for his co-workers.

Answer: 23 donuts
