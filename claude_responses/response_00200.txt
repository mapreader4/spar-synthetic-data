Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sansa sells an 8-inch portrait for $5
* Sansa sells a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait, which is $10 (2 x $5)
* Sansa sells 3 8-inch portraits per day
* Sansa sells 5 16-inch portraits per day
* So in one day, Sansa earns:
  - 3 x $5 = $15 from the 8-inch portraits
  - 5 x $10 = $50 from the 16-inch portraits
  - Total earnings per day = $15 + $50 = $65
* In 3 days, Sansa earns:
  - 3 x $65 = $195

Answer: 195
