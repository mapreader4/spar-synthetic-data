Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The organization has taken twice as many hawksbill turtles as green turtles into the conservation center.
* The number of green turtles is 800.
* To find the number of hawksbill turtles, we multiply the number of green turtles by 2:
* 800 x 2 = 1600 hawksbill turtles
* To find the total number of turtles taken into the conservation center, we add the number of green turtles and the number of hawksbill turtles:
* 800 + 1600 = 2400 turtles

Answer: 2400
