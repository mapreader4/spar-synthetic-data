Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hannah bought a washing machine for $100.
2) The dryer costs $30 less than the washing machine, so the dryer costs $70.
3) Hannah got a 10% discount for buying two appliances.
4) The total cost of the two appliances before the discount is $100 + $70 = $170.
5) The discount amount is 10% of $170, which is 0.10 * $170 = $17.
6) The total cost after the discount is $170 - $17 = $153.

Answer: $153
