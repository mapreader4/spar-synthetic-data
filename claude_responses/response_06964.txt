Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. James ate 3 bags of Cheezits, each 2 ounces. So the total amount of Cheezits he ate is 3 * 2 = 6 ounces.
2. There are 150 calories in an ounce of Cheezits. So the total calories in the 6 ounces of Cheezits he ate is 6 * 150 = 900 calories.
3. James then went for a 40-minute run and burned 12 calories per minute. So the total calories he burned during the run is 40 * 12 = 480 calories.
4. To calculate the excess calories he ate, we take the total calories he consumed (900) and subtract the calories he burned (480).
Answer: 900 - 480 = 420 excess calories.
