Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark visits 20 households a day
* He does this for 5 days
* So the total number of households he visits is 20 households per day x 5 days = 100 households
* Half of the households give him a pair of 20s
* A pair of 20s is $40
* So the amount he collected from the half of the households that gave him a pair of 20s is:
* 100 households / 2 = 50 households
* 50 households x $40 per household = $2,000

Answer: $2,000
