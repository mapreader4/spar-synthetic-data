Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janelle started with 26 green marbles.
2) She then bought 6 bags of blue marbles, with 10 marbles in each bag.
   * 6 bags x 10 marbles per bag = 60 blue marbles
3) She then created a gift for a friend, consisting of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles.
   * She gave away 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles
4) To calculate the number of marbles Janelle has now:
   * She started with 26 green marbles
   * She added 60 blue marbles
   * She gave away 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles
   * So the number of marbles she has now is:
     * Green marbles: 26 - 6 = 20
     * Blue marbles: 60 - 8 = 52
     * Total marbles: 20 + 52 = 72

Answer: 72
