Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marian's initial credit card balance is $126.00
* She puts $60.00 worth of groceries on her card
* She puts half of $60.00, which is $30.00, in gas on her card
* She returns some bath towels for $45.00
* To calculate the new balance, we start with the initial balance of $126.00
* We add the $60.00 for groceries and the $30.00 for gas, which gives us $216.00
* We then subtract the $45.00 from the bath towel return, which gives us $171.00

Answer: $171.00
