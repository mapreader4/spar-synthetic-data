Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total number of whales in the sea this year is double what it was last year. 
   * Last year, the number of whales was 4000.
   * This year, the number of whales is 2 * 4000 = 8000.
2) The World Animals Organization predicts that there will be 800 more whales in the sea next year.
   * Next year, the number of whales will be 8000 + 800 = 8800.
Answer: 8800
