Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alice walks 10 miles to school every morning, Monday through Friday.
* That's 5 days of 10 miles each, so that's 50 miles to school.
* On her way home, she walks 12 miles through the forest.
* That's 5 days of 12 miles each, so that's 60 miles home.
* To find the total miles walked that week, we add the miles to school and the miles home:
* 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles.

Answer: 110
