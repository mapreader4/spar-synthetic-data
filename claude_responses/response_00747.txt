Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The first rocket can travel 500 ft in the air.
2) The second rocket can travel twice as high as the first rocket.
3) To find the height of the second rocket, we multiply the height of the first rocket by 2:
   * Height of second rocket = 500 ft x 2 = 1000 ft
4) To find the combined height of the two rockets, we add the height of the first rocket and the height of the second rocket:
   * Combined height = 500 ft + 1000 ft = 1500 ft

Answer: 1500
