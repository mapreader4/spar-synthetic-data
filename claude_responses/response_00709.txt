Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 meatballs on each spaghetti plate
* Theresa has 3 sons
* Each of Theresa's sons eats two-thirds of the meatballs on their respective plates

First, we need to calculate how many meatballs each son eats:
* Each plate has 3 meatballs
* Each son eats two-thirds of the meatballs on their plate
* So, each son eats 2 meatballs (2/3 of 3 meatballs)

Now, we need to calculate how many meatballs are left on the plates altogether:
* There are 3 sons
* Each son eats 2 meatballs
* So, the total number of meatballs eaten is 3 x 2 = 6 meatballs
* There were originally 3 meatballs on each plate, so the total number of meatballs was 3 x 3 = 9 meatballs
* The number of meatballs left on the plates is the total number of meatballs (9) minus the number of meatballs eaten (6)
* 9 - 6 = 3 meatballs
