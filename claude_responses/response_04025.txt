Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The vampire drains 3 people per week
* The werewolf eats 5 fresh people per week
* The village has 72 people
* We need to find how many weeks the village will last them both

First, let's calculate the total number of people they consume per week:
* Vampire: 3 people per week
* Werewolf: 5 people per week
* Total: 3 + 5 = 8 people per week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks the village of 72 people will last them:
* 72 people / 8 people per week = 9 weeks

Answer: 9 weeks
