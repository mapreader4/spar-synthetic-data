Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tim uses 10 charms to make each necklace.
2) Each charm costs $15.
3) So the cost of the charms for each necklace is 10 * $15 = $150.
4) Tim sells each necklace for $200.
5) If he sells 30 necklaces, his total revenue is 30 * $200 = $6,000.
6) His total cost for the 30 necklaces is 30 * $150 = $4,500.
7) His profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $6,000 - $4,500 = $1,500.

Answer: $1,500
