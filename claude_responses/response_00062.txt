Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 290 liters of oil in 24 cans
* 10 of the cans are holding 8 liters each
* To find the amount of oil in the remaining 14 cans, we need to:
  1. Calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans holding 8 liters each:
     * 10 cans x 8 liters per can = 80 liters
  2. Subtract the amount of oil in the 10 cans from the total amount of oil:
     * 290 liters - 80 liters = 210 liters
  3. Divide the remaining 210 liters by the 14 remaining cans to find the amount of oil in each remaining can:
     * 210 liters / 14 cans = 15 liters per can

Answer: 15 liters
