Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alex's weekly income is $500.
2) 10% of his weekly income is deducted as tax. 10% of $500 is $50, so the tax deduction is $50.
3) After the tax deduction, Alex has $500 - $50 = $450 left.
4) Alex also pays a weekly water bill of $55.
5) After paying the water bill, Alex has $450 - $55 = $395 left.
6) Alex also gives away 10% of his weekly income as a tithe. 10% of $500 is $50, so the tithe is $50.
7) After paying the tithe, Alex has $395 - $50 = $345 left.

Answer: $345
