Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Barbi lost 1.5 kilograms each month for a year.
   * In a year, there are 12 months.
   * So, Barbi lost 1.5 kilograms x 12 months = 18 kilograms in a year.

2. Luca lost 9 kilograms every year for 11 years.
   * Luca lost 9 kilograms per year.
   * He did this for 11 years.
   * So, Luca lost 9 kilograms x 11 years = 99 kilograms in total.

3. To find the difference between how much Luca lost and how much Barbi lost:
   * Luca lost 99 kilograms.
   * Barbi lost 18 kilograms.
   * The difference is 99 kilograms - 18 kilograms = 81 kilograms.

Answer: 81 kilograms.
