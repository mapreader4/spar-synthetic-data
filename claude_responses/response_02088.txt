Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sam needs to make 8 servings of spaghetti and meatballs
* The pasta costs $1.00 per box
* The jar of sauce costs $2.00
* 1 pound of meatballs costs $5.00
* To make 8 servings, we need:
    - 1 box of pasta ($1.00)
    - 1 jar of sauce ($2.00)
    - 1 pound of meatballs ($5.00)
* The total cost of the ingredients is:
    - $1.00 + $2.00 + $5.00 = $8.00
* To calculate the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:
    - $8.00 / 8 servings = $1.00 per serving

Answer: $1.00
