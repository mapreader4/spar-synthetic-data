Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There are 15 girls and 10 boys in Ms. Smith's class, for a total of 25 students.
2) Ms. Smith divided 375 books equally among the 25 students.
3) To find the number of books each student received, we divide 375 by 25:
375 รท 25 = 15 books per student.
4) Since there are 15 girls, the total number of books the girls received is:
15 girls ร 15 books per student = 225 books.

Answer: 225
