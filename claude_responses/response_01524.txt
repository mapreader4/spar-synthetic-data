Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Max attended 40 college courses in 2 years
* Sid attended four times as many college courses as Max in the same period
* To find the number of college courses Sid attended, we multiply Max's courses by 4:
* 40 courses x 4 = 160 courses
* Now, to find the total number of college courses they both attended, we add Max's courses and Sid's courses:
* 40 courses + 160 courses = 200 courses

Answer: 200
