Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone.
* Each subsequent day, she spends twice as much time as the day before.
* So, the time spent on the phone each day is:
  - Day 1: 5 minutes
  - Day 2: 5 x 2 = 10 minutes
  - Day 3: 10 x 2 = 20 minutes
  - Day 4: 20 x 2 = 40 minutes
  - Day 5: 40 x 2 = 80 minutes
* After the 5th day, her parents take the phone away, so she doesn't spend any more time on the phone that week.
* To calculate the total time spent on the phone that week, we add up the time spent each day:
  - Total time = 5 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 80 = 155 minutes

Answer: 155
