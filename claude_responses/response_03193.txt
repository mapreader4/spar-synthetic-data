Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes 40 minutes to freeze the ice cubes
* It takes 3 minutes per smoothie to turn the frozen ice cubes into a smoothie
* We need to make 5 smoothies

First, we calculate the time it takes to make the 5 smoothies:
* 3 minutes per smoothie x 5 smoothies = 15 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to freeze the ice cubes:
* 40 minutes + 15 minutes = 55 minutes

Answer: 55 minutes
