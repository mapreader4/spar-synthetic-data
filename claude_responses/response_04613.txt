Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The class has 30 high school students
* Each student contributes $2 every Friday
* We want to know how much money they will have in 2 months

First, let's calculate how much money each student will contribute in 2 months:
* There are 4 Fridays in a month
* In 2 months, there are 8 Fridays
* Each student contributes $2 per Friday
* So each student will contribute 8 * $2 = $16 in 2 months

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the class will have in 2 months:
* There are 30 students in the class
* Each student will contribute $16
* So the total amount of money the class will have is 30 * $16 = $480

Answer: $480
