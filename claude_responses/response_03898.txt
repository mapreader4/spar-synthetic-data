Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Susie charges $3 per slice of pizza.
2) She sold 24 slices of pizza.
3) So for the 24 slices of pizza, she earned: 24 x $3 = $72.
4) Susie also charges $15 for a whole pizza.
5) She sold 3 whole pizzas.
6) So for the 3 whole pizzas, she earned: 3 x $15 = $45.
7) To calculate the total amount of money Susie earned, we add the money earned from the slices and the whole pizzas:
$72 + $45 = $117.

Answer: $117
