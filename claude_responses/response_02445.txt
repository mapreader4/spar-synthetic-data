Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The lizard has 3 eyes
* The lizard has 3 times more wrinkles than eyes
* So the lizard has 3 x 3 = 9 wrinkles
* The lizard has 7 times more spots than wrinkles
* So the lizard has 7 x 9 = 63 spots
* The combined number of spots and wrinkles is 63 + 9 = 72
* The difference between the number of eyes and the combined number of spots and wrinkles is 72 - 3 = 69

Answer: 69
