Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Archie holds the school record for most touchdown passes with 89 in a season of 16 games.
* Richard has averaged 6 touchdowns per game in the first 14 games.
* To calculate the total touchdowns Richard has scored in the first 14 games:
  * 6 touchdowns per game x 14 games = 84 total touchdowns
* To beat Archie's record of 89 touchdowns, Richard needs to score 90 or more touchdowns.
* To calculate the number of touchdowns Richard needs to score in the final 2 games:
  * 90 touchdowns (to beat the record) - 84 touchdowns (scored in first 14 games) = 6 touchdowns needed
* To calculate the average number of touchdowns per game Richard needs to score in the final 2 games:
  * 6 touchdowns needed / 2 games = 3 touchdowns per game

Answer: 3 touchdowns per game
