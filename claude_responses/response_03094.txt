Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gina can paint 6 rose cups per hour
* Gina can paint 7 lily cups per hour
* The order is for 6 rose cups and 14 lily cups
* To calculate the total time it takes Gina to complete the order:
    - For the 6 rose cups, it will take her 6 / 6 = 1 hour
    - For the 14 lily cups, it will take her 14 / 7 = 2 hours
    - Total time = 1 hour + 2 hours = 3 hours
* Gina gets paid $90 total for the order
* To calculate her hourly rate:
    - Hourly rate = Total pay / Total hours
    - Hourly rate = $90 / 3 hours
    - Hourly rate = $30 per hour

Answer: 30
