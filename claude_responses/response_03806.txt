Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The avant-garde sushi house sells jellyfish for a certain amount
* The eel costs 9 times the amount of the jellyfish
* The combined cost of one order of each kind of sushi is $200

Let's call the cost of the jellyfish 'x'.
Then the cost of the eel is 9x.

We know the combined cost of one order of each kind of sushi is $200, so we can set up an equation:
x + 9x = 200
10x = 200
x = 20

Therefore, the cost of the eel is 9 times the cost of the jellyfish, which is 9 * $20 = $180.

Answer: 180
