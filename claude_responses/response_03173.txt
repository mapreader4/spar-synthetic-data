Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Phil buys a pack of 20 baseball cards each week for a year.
2) There are 52 weeks in a year, so Phil buys 20 x 52 = 1,040 baseball cards in total.
3) However, Phil then loses half of his baseball cards in a fire.
4) Half of 1,040 is 520.
5) Therefore, Phil has 1,040 - 520 = 520 baseball cards left.

Answer: 520
