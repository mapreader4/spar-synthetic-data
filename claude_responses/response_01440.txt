Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Team Soccer Stars played a total of 20 games
* They won 14 games
* They lost 2 games
* They drew the remaining games (20 - 14 - 2 = 4 games)
* They earn 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss
* For the 14 wins, they earned 14 * 3 = 42 points
* For the 4 draws, they earned 4 * 1 = 4 points
* For the 2 losses, they earned 0 points
* To calculate the total points, we add the points from wins, draws, and losses:
* Total points = 42 + 4 + 0 = 46

Answer: 46
