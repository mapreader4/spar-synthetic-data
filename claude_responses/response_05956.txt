To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for each option and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- The trip is 150 kilometers long each way, so the total distance is 300 kilometers.
- The first option for car rental costs $50 a day, excluding gasoline.
- The second option costs $90 a day, including gasoline.
- A liter of gasoline can cover 15 kilometers and costs $0.90 per liter.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first option.
Total distance = 300 kilometers
Fuel consumption = 300 kilometers / 15 kilometers per liter = 20 liters
Fuel cost = 20 liters Ã— $0.90 per liter = $18
Total cost for the first option = $50 (car rental) + $18 (fuel) = $68

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the second option.
Total cost for the second option = $90 (car rental including gasoline)

Step 3: Calculate the savings by choosing the first option.
Savings = Total cost for the second option - Total cost for the first option
Savings = $90 - $68 = $22

Answer: $22
