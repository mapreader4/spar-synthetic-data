Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first friend runs 3 miles in 21 minutes
* This means their pace is 3 miles / 21 minutes = 0.143 miles per minute
* The second friend runs 3 miles in 24 minutes
* This means their pace is 3 miles / 24 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute
* Now, we need to find how long it will take each of them to run 5 miles at their respective paces
* For the first friend:
  * Pace = 0.143 miles per minute
  * Time to run 5 miles = 5 miles / 0.143 miles per minute = 35 minutes
* For the second friend:
  * Pace = 0.125 miles per minute
  * Time to run 5 miles = 5 miles / 0.125 miles per minute = 40 minutes
* To find the combined time, we add the times for each friend:
  * 35 minutes + 40 minutes = 75 minutes

Answer: 75 minutes
