Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The base cost of the ice cream is $2.00
* Each topping costs $0.50
* The sundae has 10 toppings

To calculate the total cost, we need to add the base cost of the ice cream ($2.00) and the cost of the 10 toppings ($0.50 x 10 = $5.00).

Therefore, the total cost of the sundae with 10 toppings is:
$2.00 (ice cream) + $5.00 (10 toppings) = $7.00

Answer: $7
