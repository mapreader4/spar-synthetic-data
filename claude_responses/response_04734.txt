Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 10 blue chairs.
2) The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs. So, the number of green chairs is 3 x 10 = 30.
3) The number of white chairs is 13 fewer than the combined number of green and blue chairs. The combined number of green and blue chairs is 30 + 10 = 40. So, the number of white chairs is 40 - 13 = 27.
4) To find the total number of chairs in the classroom, we add up the number of blue, green, and white chairs:
10 + 30 + 27 = 67

Answer: 67
