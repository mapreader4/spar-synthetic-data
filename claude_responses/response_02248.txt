Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) In the first competition, the team won 40 games.
2) In the second competition, they won 5/8 times as many games as they won in the first competition.
   * 5/8 of 40 games = 5/8 * 40 = 25 games
3) In the third competition, they won the same number of games as the sum of the first and second competition winnings.
   * First competition winnings: 40 games
   * Second competition winnings: 25 games
   * Sum of first and second competition winnings: 40 + 25 = 65 games
   * Therefore, they won 65 games in the third competition.

Now, we can calculate the total number of wins they had in the three competitions:
* Total wins = First competition wins + Second competition wins + Third competition wins
* Total wins = 40 + 25 + 65 = 130 games

Answer: 130
