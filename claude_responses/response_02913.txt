Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 100 tickets to be sold for the volleyball game
* Andrea sold twice as many tickets as Jude
* Sandra sold 4 more than half the number of tickets Jude sold
* Jude sold 16 tickets

First, let's calculate how many tickets Andrea sold:
* Jude sold 16 tickets
* Andrea sold twice as many, so Andrea sold 2 x 16 = 32 tickets

Next, let's calculate how many tickets Sandra sold:
* Jude sold 16 tickets
* Half of 16 is 8
* Sandra sold 4 more than 8, so Sandra sold 8 + 4 = 12 tickets

Now, we can add up the tickets sold by Andrea, Jude, and Sandra:
* Andrea sold 32 tickets
* Jude sold 16 tickets
* Sandra sold 12 tickets
* Total tickets sold = 32 + 16 + 12 = 60 tickets

Finally, to calculate how many tickets need to be sold, we take the total number of tickets (100) and subtract the number of tickets already sold (60):
* 100 - 60 = 40 tickets

Answer: 40
