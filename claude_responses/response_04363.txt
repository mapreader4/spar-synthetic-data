Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Fabian wants to buy:
  - 5 kilograms of apples
  - 3 packs of sugar
  - 500 grams of walnuts
* The cost of 1 kilogram of apples is $2
* The cost of 1 kilogram of walnuts is $6
* The cost of 1 pack of sugar is $1 cheaper than 1 kilogram of apples

First, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
* 5 kilograms of apples at $2 per kilogram = 5 x $2 = $10

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sugar:
* 1 pack of sugar is $1 cheaper than 1 kilogram of apples, so 1 pack of sugar costs $1
* 3 packs of sugar at $1 per pack = 3 x $1 = $3

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the walnuts:
* 500 grams of walnuts is 0.5 kilograms
* 1 kilogram of walnuts costs $6
* 0.5 kilograms of walnuts at $6 per kilogram = 0.5 x $6 = $3

Now, let's add up the total cost:
* Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of sugar + Cost of walnuts
* Total cost = $10 + $3 + $3 = $16
