Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Samantha bought a crate of 30 eggs for $5.
2) She plans to sell each egg for 20 cents.
3) To recover her capital of $5, she needs to sell enough eggs to make $5.
4) Each egg sells for 20 cents, so she needs to sell enough eggs to make $5.
5) To calculate how many eggs she needs to sell, we divide $5 by 20 cents per egg:
$5 / $0.20 per egg = 25 eggs
6) Therefore, Samantha will have 30 - 25 = 5 eggs left by the time she recovers her capital from the sales.
