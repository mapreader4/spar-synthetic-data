Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rachel makes $12.00 per hour as a waitress.
2) In one hour, she serves 20 different people.
3) Each person leaves her a $1.25 tip.
4) To calculate her total tips for the hour, we multiply the number of people (20) by the tip amount ($1.25):
20 people x $1.25 tip = $25.00 in tips.
5) To calculate her total earnings for the hour, we add her hourly wage ($12.00) to her tips ($25.00):
$12.00 + $25.00 = $37.00.

Answer: $37
