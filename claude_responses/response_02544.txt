Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael's largest watermelon weighs 8 pounds
* Clay's watermelon is three times the size of Michael's watermelon
* To find the size of Clay's watermelon, we multiply Michael's watermelon by 3:
  * 8 pounds x 3 = 24 pounds
* John's watermelon is half the size of Clay's watermelon
* To find the size of John's watermelon, we divide Clay's watermelon by 2:
  * 24 pounds / 2 = 12 pounds

Answer: 12 pounds
