Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The length of the straight part of the river is three times shorter than the crooked part.
2) This means that the length of the crooked part is three times longer than the straight part.
3) The total length of the river is 80 miles.
4) Let's call the length of the straight part 'x'.
5) Since the crooked part is three times longer than the straight part, the length of the crooked part is '3x'.
6) The total length of the river is the sum of the straight part and the crooked part, so 80 = x + 3x.
7) Solving this equation, we get x = 20.

Answer: 20 miles
