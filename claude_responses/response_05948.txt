Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Land costs:
   * The land required is 2000 square meters
   * The cost per square meter is $50
   * Therefore, the total land cost is: 2000 square meters x $50 per square meter = $100,000

2. Brick costs:
   * The house requires 10,000 bricks
   * The cost per 1,000 bricks is $100
   * Therefore, the total brick cost is: (10,000 bricks / 1,000 bricks) x $100 per 1,000 bricks = $1,000

3. Roof tile costs:
   * The house requires 500 roof tiles
   * The cost per roof tile is $10
   * Therefore, the total roof tile cost is: 500 roof tiles x $10 per roof tile = $5,000

4. Total construction costs:
   * Adding up the land, brick, and roof tile costs:
   * $100,000 + $1,000 + $5,000 = $106,000

Answer: $106,000
