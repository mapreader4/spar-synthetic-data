Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there are 22 people in the waiting room
* 3 more people arrive, so now there are 22 + 3 = 25 people in the waiting room
* The number of people in the waiting room is now five times the number of people in the interview room
* Let's call the number of people in the interview room "x"
* We know that 25 = 5x, so we can solve for x
* 25 = 5x
* x = 25 / 5
* x = 5

Therefore, the number of people in the interview room is 5.

Answer: 5
