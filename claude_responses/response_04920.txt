Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Erin finds 8 less than 6 times as many obsolete books as damaged books.
2) Let's represent the number of damaged books as x.
3) Then the number of obsolete books is 6x - 8.
4) The total number of books removed is 69.
5) The total number of books removed is the sum of the damaged books and the obsolete books:
   x + (6x - 8) = 69
6) Simplifying this equation:
   7x - 8 = 69
7) Solving for x:
   7x = 77
   x = 11
Therefore, the number of damaged books is 11.

Answer: 11
