Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bogan laid out 10 maggots for the beetle initially
* The beetle ate 1 of those maggots
* Bogan had to throw out the remaining 9 maggots
* Later that day, Bogan tried feeding the beetle again
* The beetle ate 3 of the maggots this time
* In total, Bogan served 20 maggots

To find how many maggots Bogan attempted to feed the beetle the second time, we can use the following equation:

Total maggots served = Initial maggots + Second attempt maggots
20 = 10 + Second attempt maggots
Second attempt maggots = 20 - 10 = 10

Therefore, Bogan attempted to feed the beetle 10 maggots the second time.

Answer: 10
