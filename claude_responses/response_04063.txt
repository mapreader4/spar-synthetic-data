Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Big stack pancakes have 5 pancakes each
* Short stack pancakes have 3 pancakes each
* 9 customers ordered the short stack
* 6 customers ordered the big stack

First, let's calculate the number of pancakes needed for the short stack orders:
* 9 customers x 3 pancakes per short stack = 27 pancakes

Next, let's calculate the number of pancakes needed for the big stack orders:
* 6 customers x 5 pancakes per big stack = 30 pancakes

Finally, to get the total number of pancakes Hank needs to make, we add the pancakes for the short stack and big stack orders:
* 27 pancakes + 30 pancakes = 57 pancakes

Answer: 57
