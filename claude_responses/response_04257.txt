Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dimitri eats 3 burgers per day
* Each burger has 20 calories
* We want to find the total calories he will get after two days

First, let's calculate the calories he will get in one day:
* 3 burgers per day x 20 calories per burger = 60 calories per day

Now, to find the total calories after two days, we multiply the calories per day by the number of days:
* 60 calories per day x 2 days = 120 calories

Answer: 120
