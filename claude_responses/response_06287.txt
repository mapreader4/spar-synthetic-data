Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John can produce 1000 tires a day.
2) It costs $250 to produce each tire.
3) He sells them for 1.5 times as much, which means he sells each tire for $375 (1.5 x $250).
4) He could sell 1200 tires a day if his factory was able to produce more.
5) The difference between the number of tires he can produce (1000) and the number he could sell (1200) is 200 tires per day.
6) The revenue he loses per day by not being able to produce all the tires is 200 tires x $375 per tire = $75,000 per day.
7) There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of money he loses out on per week is $75,000 per day x 7 days = $525,000.

Answer: $525,000
