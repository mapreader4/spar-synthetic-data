Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenny makes 20 pans of lasagna
* It costs her $10.00 in ingredients to make 1 pan of lasagna
* So, the total cost of ingredients for 20 pans is:
    - 20 pans x $10.00 per pan = $200.00
* Jenny sells each pan for $25.00
* So, the total revenue from selling 20 pans is:
    - 20 pans x $25.00 per pan = $500.00
* To calculate her profit, we take the total revenue and subtract the total expenses:
    - Total Revenue: $500.00
    - Total Expenses: $200.00
    - Profit: $500.00 - $200.00 = $300.00

Answer: $300
