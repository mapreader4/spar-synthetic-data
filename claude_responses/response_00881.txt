Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark visits the theater at least once a week
* Each performance lasts 3 hours
* The price of the ticket is $5 per hour spent in the theater

To calculate the total cost for 6 weeks, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost per visit
2. Multiply the cost per visit by the number of visits

Cost per visit:
* Each performance lasts 3 hours
* Cost per hour is $5
* Therefore, the cost per visit is 3 hours x $5 per hour = $15

Number of visits:
* Mark visits the theater at least once a week
* There are 6 weeks
* Therefore, the minimum number of visits is 6

Total cost:
* Cost per visit is $15
* Number of visits is 6
* Therefore, the total cost is 6 x $15 = $90

Answer: $90
