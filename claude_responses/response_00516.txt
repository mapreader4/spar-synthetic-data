Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Max spent 20 minutes on biology
* He spent two times more time on history than on biology
* So, the time spent on history is 2 x 20 minutes = 40 minutes
* Geography took him three times more time than history
* So, the time spent on geography is 3 x 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, to find the total time Max spent on his homework, we add up the time spent on each subject:
* Total time = 20 minutes (biology) + 40 minutes (history) + 120 minutes (geography)
* Total time = 180 minutes

Answer: 180
