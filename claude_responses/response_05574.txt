Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mike practices for 3 hours every weekday
* He practices for 5 hours on Saturdays
* He takes Sundays off
* His team has a game in 3 weeks

To calculate the total number of hours he will practice until the next game, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of weekdays in 3 weeks: 
   * There are 5 weekdays in a week
   * 3 weeks x 5 weekdays/week = 15 weekdays
2. Calculate the number of Saturdays in 3 weeks:
   * There is 1 Saturday per week
   * 3 weeks x 1 Saturday/week = 3 Saturdays
3. Calculate the total number of practice hours:
   * Weekdays: 15 days x 3 hours/day = 45 hours
   * Saturdays: 3 days x 5 hours/day = 15 hours
   * Total hours = 45 hours + 15 hours = 60 hours

Answer: 60 hours
