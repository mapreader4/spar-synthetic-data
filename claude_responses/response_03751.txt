Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The monkey swings at an average distance of 1.2 meters per second.
* The monkey swings consistently for 30 minutes.
* To find the total distance the monkey swings, we need to multiply the average speed by the total time.
* 30 minutes = 1800 seconds.
* 1.2 meters per second x 1800 seconds = 2,160 meters.

Answer: 2,160 meters.
