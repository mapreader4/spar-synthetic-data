Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Van Helsing gets paid $5 per vampire and $10 per werewolf
* He removes half the vampires and 8 werewolves
* He earned $105 in total

First, let's find out how many vampires and werewolves there were initially.

Let's say there were x vampires and 4x werewolves (since there were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires).

Van Helsing removed half the vampires, so he removed x/2 vampires.
He also removed 8 werewolves.

The total amount he earned is:
* (x/2) * $5 + 8 * $10 = $105

Solving this equation:
* (x/2) * $5 + 8 * $10 = $105
* 5x/2 + 80 = 105
* 5x = 50
* x = 10

So, there were 10 vampires and 40 werewolves initially.

Now, to find the percentage of werewolves he removed:
* He removed 8 werewolves out of 40 total werewolves
* 8 / 40 = 0.2 = 20%

Answer: 20%
