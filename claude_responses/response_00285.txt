Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John wants to finish a show in 5 days
* There are 20 episodes
* Each episode is 30 minutes long

First, we need to calculate the total duration of the show:
* 20 episodes x 30 minutes per episode = 600 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total duration from minutes to hours:
* 600 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 10 hours

Finally, to find how many hours John needs to watch per day, we divide the total duration by the number of days:
* 10 hours / 5 days = 2 hours per day

Answer: 2 hours
