Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The original commercial is 30 seconds long.
* Ursula's boss told her to shorten the commercial by 30%.
* To calculate the new length of the commercial after the 30% reduction:
* 30% of 30 seconds is 0.3 x 30 = 9 seconds.
* So, the new length of the commercial will be 30 seconds - 9 seconds = 21 seconds.

Answer: 21 seconds.
