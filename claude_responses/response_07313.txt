Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James can make 4 hats out of 1 yard of velvet
* He needs 3 yards of velvet to make 1 cloak
* He needs to make 6 cloaks and 12 hats

First, let's calculate how much velvet he needs for the 6 cloaks:
* 6 cloaks x 3 yards per cloak = 18 yards of velvet

Next, let's calculate how much velvet he needs for the 12 hats:
* 12 hats / 4 hats per yard = 3 yards of velvet

Finally, we add the velvet needed for the cloaks and the hats:
* 18 yards + 3 yards = 21 yards of velvet
