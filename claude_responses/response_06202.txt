Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Initially, there were 7 parrots and some crows perched on the tree branch.
2) When there was a noise, the same number of parrots and crows flew away.
3) After the birds flew away, there were 2 parrots and 1 crow left on the tree branch.
4) Let's call the initial number of crows 'x'.
5) Since the same number of parrots and crows flew away, the number of parrots and crows that flew away was 'x'.
6) So, the number of parrots left is 7 - x, and the number of crows left is x - 1.
7) We know that 2 parrots and 1 crow are left, so we can set up an equation:
7 - x = 2
x - 1 = 1
8) Solving these equations, we get:
x = 5
9) Therefore, the initial number of birds on the tree branch was:
7 parrots + 5 crows = 12 birds

Answer: 12
