Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first route has 3 stoplights
* If all 3 lights are green, the first route takes 10 minutes
* Each red light adds 3 minutes to the trip
* The second route takes 14 minutes and has no stoplights

If all 3 stoplights are red on the first route, that means:
* Each red light adds 3 minutes to the trip
* So 3 red lights would add 3 x 3 = 9 minutes to the trip

The first route with all 3 lights red would take:
* 10 minutes (if all lights were green)
* + 9 minutes (for the 3 red lights)
* = 19 minutes

The second route takes 14 minutes.

So if all 3 stoplights are red on the first route, the trip will be 19 minutes, which is 5 minutes longer than the 14 minute second route.
