Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Monica and Sheila's mother gave them $50 to spend
* They spent $12 on toilet paper
* They spent twice the cost of the toilet paper ($12 x 2 = $24) on groceries (apples, butter, eggs, and a large ham)
* So the total amount they spent on the toilet paper and groceries is $12 + $24 = $36
* They had $50 - $36 = $14 left over
* They wanted to buy two pairs of boots, and each pair of boots costs 3 times the amount they had left ($14 x 3 = $42)
* So the total cost of the two pairs of boots is $42 x 2 = $84
* Since they only had $14 left over, they would need to add $84 - $14 = $70 of their own money to buy the two pairs of boots
* Since Monica and Sheila are twins, they would each need to add $70 / 2 = $35 of their own money to buy the two pairs of boots.

Answer: $35
