Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Carla, Kyle, and Tasha caught a total of 36 fish.
2) We also know that Carla caught 8 fish.
3) Since Kyle and Tasha caught the same number of fish, we can represent the number of fish they each caught as x.
4) So, the total number of fish caught can be represented as: 8 + x + x = 36
5) Simplifying this equation, we get: 8 + 2x = 36
6) Solving for x, we get: 2x = 28, so x = 14.

Answer: 14
