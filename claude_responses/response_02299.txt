To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of games played and then calculate the percentage of games Archibald has won.

Given information:
- Archibald has won 12 games.
- Archibald's brother has won 18 games.

Step 1: Find the total number of games played.
Total games played = Archibald's wins + Archibald's brother's wins
Total games played = 12 + 18 = 30 games

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of games Archibald has won.
Percentage of games Archibald has won = (Archibald's wins / Total games played) × 100
Percentage of games Archibald has won = (12 / 30) × 100 = 40%

Answer: 40%
