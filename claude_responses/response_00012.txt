Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm.
2) He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.
3) To find the number of coconut trees, we first need to find half the number of mango trees:
   * Half of 60 mango trees = 60 / 2 = 30 coconut trees
4) Now we subtract 5 from the 30 coconut trees to get the actual number of coconut trees:
   * 30 coconut trees - 5 = 25 coconut trees
5) To find the total number of trees on the farm, we add the mango trees and coconut trees:
   * 60 mango trees + 25 coconut trees = 85 trees

Answer: 85
