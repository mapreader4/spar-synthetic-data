Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices
* 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person
* We need to find how many tomatoes Thelma needs to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal

First, we need to find how many slices are needed to feed a family of 8:
* 20 slices per person x 8 people = 160 slices needed

Next, we need to find how many tomatoes are required to make 160 slices:
* 160 slices / 8 slices per tomato = 20 tomatoes

Therefore, Thelma will need to use 20 tomatoes to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal.

Answer: 20
