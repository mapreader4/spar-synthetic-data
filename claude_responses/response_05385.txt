Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The ratio of boys to girls at the dance was 3:4.
2) There were 60 girls at the dance.
3) To find the number of boys, we can use the ratio. Since the ratio is 3:4, and there are 60 girls, we can set up a proportion:
3/4 = x/60
Solving for x, we get x = 45 boys.
4) The teachers were 20% of the number of boys. To find the number of teachers, we can take 20% of the 45 boys:
20% of 45 = 0.2 * 45 = 9 teachers.
5) To find the total number of people at the dance, we add the number of girls, boys, and teachers:
60 girls + 45 boys + 9 teachers = 114 people.

Answer: 114
