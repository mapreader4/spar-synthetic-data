Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The train takes 2 hours longer than the car to go the same distance.
* The car reaches station B 4.5 hours after leaving station A.
* Since the train takes 2 hours longer, we can calculate the time it takes the train to reach station B:
  * Time taken by the train = Time taken by the car + 2 hours
  * Time taken by the train = 4.5 hours + 2 hours = 6.5 hours
* Now, to calculate the combined time the car and the train take to reach station B, we add the time taken by the car (4.5 hours) and the time taken by the train (6.5 hours):
  * Combined time = 4.5 hours + 6.5 hours = 11 hours
