Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Manuel counted 100 tents in the northernmost part of the campsite.
2) He counted twice that number on the east side of the grounds, which means there were 200 tents on the east side.
3) The number of tents at the center of the camp was four times the number of tents in the northernmost part, which means there were 400 tents at the center.
4) Mr. Manuel also counted 200 tents in the southern part of the campsite.
5) To find the total number of tents in the recreation area, we add up the tents in each part:
100 (northernmost) + 200 (east side) + 400 (center) + 200 (south) = 900 tents.

Answer: 900
