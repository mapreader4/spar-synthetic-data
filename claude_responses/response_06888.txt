Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The supermarket sold 54 pints of strawberries during the sale.
2) They made $216 from the sale.
3) If they had not had the sale, they would have made $216 + $108 = $324.
4) The difference between the sale price and the regular price is $324 - $216 = $108.
5) To find the difference in price per pint, we divide the total difference ($108) by the number of pints sold (54).
6) $108 / 54 = $2.
Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 2
