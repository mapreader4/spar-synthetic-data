Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tabitha caught 22 pieces of candy
* Stan caught 13 pieces of candy
* Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha, which is 22 / 2 = 11 pieces
* Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan, which is 13 * 2 = 26 pieces

Now, to find the total amount of candy caught by the friends, we add up the individual amounts:
* Tabitha: 22 pieces
* Stan: 13 pieces
* Julie: 11 pieces
* Carlos: 26 pieces

Total pieces of candy caught = 22 + 13 + 11 + 26 = 72 pieces

Answer: 72
