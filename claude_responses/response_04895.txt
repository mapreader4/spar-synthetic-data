Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total distance of the drive is 210 miles.
* Christina's speed limit is 30 miles per hour.
* Her friend's speed limit is 40 miles per hour.
* Her friend drives for 3 hours.

First, we can calculate how many miles her friend drove:
* Her friend's speed × time = distance
* 40 miles per hour × 3 hours = 120 miles

Now, we can calculate the remaining distance that Christina needs to drive:
* Total distance - distance her friend drove = distance Christina needs to drive
* 210 miles - 120 miles = 90 miles

Finally, we can calculate how long it will take Christina to drive the remaining 90 miles:
* Distance / Christina's speed = time
* 90 miles / 30 miles per hour = 3 hours

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:
* 3 hours × 60 minutes per hour = 180 minutes

Answer: 180 minutes
