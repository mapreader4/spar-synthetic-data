Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nicki ran for the full year, which is 52 weeks
* For the first half of the year (26 weeks), she ran 20 miles per week
* So for the first half of the year, she ran 20 miles x 26 weeks = 520 miles
* For the second half of the year (26 weeks), she ran 30 miles per week
* So for the second half of the year, she ran 30 miles x 26 weeks = 780 miles
* To get the total miles for the year, we add the miles from the first half and the second half:
* 520 miles + 780 miles = 1,300 miles

Answer: 1,300
