Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that 4 pugs can clean the house in 45 minutes.
2) This means that the rate at which the 4 pugs can clean the house is 4 / 45 = 1/11.25 pugs per minute.
3) Now, we want to know how long it will take 15 pugs to clean the house.
4) The rate at which the 15 pugs can clean the house is 15 times the rate of 4 pugs, which is 15 * 1/11.25 = 15/11.25 = 4/3.75 pugs per minute.
5) To find the time it will take 15 pugs to clean the house, we divide the number of pugs (15) by the rate (4/3.75) pugs per minute.
6) 15 / (4/3.75) = 15 * 3.75/4 = 14.0625 minutes.

Answer: 14 minutes.
