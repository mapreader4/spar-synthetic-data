Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The project was supposed to take Bill 4 days to complete
* Bill took 6 seven-hour naps during those 4 days
* To find the time he spent working on the project, we need to subtract the time he spent napping from the total time available

First, let's calculate the total time he spent napping:
* 6 naps x 7 hours per nap = 42 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time available for the project:
* 4 days x 24 hours per day = 96 hours

Finally, we subtract the time spent napping from the total time available:
* 96 hours - 42 hours = 54 hours

Therefore, Bill spent 54 hours working on the project.

Answer: 54
