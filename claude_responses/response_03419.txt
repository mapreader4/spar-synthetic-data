Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Luis bought 4 pairs of red socks and 6 pairs of blue socks
* The red socks cost $3 each
* In total, he spent $42

First, let's calculate the cost of the red socks:
* 4 pairs of red socks at $3 each = 4 x $3 = $12

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the blue socks by subtracting the cost of the red socks from the total amount spent:
* Total spent = $42
* Cost of red socks = $12
* Cost of blue socks = $42 - $12 = $30

Since Luis bought 6 pairs of blue socks, we can divide the cost of the blue socks by 6 to get the cost per pair:
* Cost per pair of blue socks = $30 / 6 = $5

Answer: $5
