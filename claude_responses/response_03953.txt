Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league.
* This means that the total number of goals scored by the two players is 20% of the total number of goals scored in the league.
* The total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300.
* Since the two players scored an equal number of goals, let's call the number of goals scored by each player 'x'.
* The total number of goals scored by the two players is 2x.
* 2x is 20% of the total number of goals scored in the league, which is 300.
* Therefore, 2x = 0.2 * 300 = 60.
* Solving for x, we get x = 30.

Answer: 30
