Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Justice currently has 3 ferns, 5 palms, and 7 succulent plants in her house.
2) To calculate the total number of plants she currently has, we add these together:
3 + 5 + 7 = 15 plants
3) Justice wants a total of 24 plants in her home.
4) To find how many more plants she needs, we subtract the number of plants she currently has from the total she wants:
24 - 15 = 9 plants
