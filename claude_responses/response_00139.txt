Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janice's office is on the third floor, so she has to walk up 3 flights of stairs to get to her office.
* In a single day, she goes up the three flights of stairs 5 times.
* That means she walks up 3 flights of stairs 5 times, which is 3 * 5 = 15 flights of stairs up.
* She also goes down the three flights of stairs 3 times.
* That means she walks down 3 flights of stairs 3 times, which is 3 * 3 = 9 flights of stairs down.
* So the total number of flights of stairs she walks (up and down) in a single day is 15 + 9 = 24 flights of stairs.
