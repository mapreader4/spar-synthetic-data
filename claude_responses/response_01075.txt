Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The hoodie cost $80.
2. The flashlight was 20% of the hoodie's price, which is 20% of $80 = $16.
3. The pair of boots originally cost $110.
4. Due to a special promotion, Celina was able to buy the boots 10% cheaper. This means she paid 90% of the original price, which is 90% of $110 = $99.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Celina spent:
Hoodie: $80
Flashlight: $16
Boots: $99

Total amount spent = $80 + $16 + $99 = $195

Answer: $195
