Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Steve has 12 popsicle sticks
* Sid has twice as many as Steve, so Sid has 2 x 12 = 24 popsicle sticks
* Sam has thrice as many as Sid, so Sam has 3 x 24 = 72 popsicle sticks
* To find the total number of popsicle sticks they can use for their Art class activity, we add up the number of sticks each person has:
* Total popsicle sticks = Steve's sticks + Sid's sticks + Sam's sticks
* Total popsicle sticks = 12 + 24 + 72 = 108

Answer: 108
