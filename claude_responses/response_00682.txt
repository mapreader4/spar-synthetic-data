Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roe saved $10 per month from January to July, which is 7 months.
* So the total saved from January to July is: 7 months x $10 per month = $70.
* Roe saved $15 per month from August to November, which is 4 months.
* So the total saved from August to November is: 4 months x $15 per month = $60.
* The total saved from January to November is: $70 + $60 = $130.
* To reach a total savings of $150 for the year, Roe needs to save an additional $150 - $130 = $20 in December.

Answer: $20
