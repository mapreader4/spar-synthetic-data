Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each flamingo has 20 tail feathers.
2) It's only safe to pluck 25% of their tail feathers at one time.
3) Milly needs to make 12 boas.
4) Each boa has 200 feathers.
5) To calculate the total number of feathers needed, we multiply the number of boas (12) by the number of feathers per boa (200): 12 x 200 = 2,400 feathers.
6) Since each flamingo has 20 tail feathers, and Milly can only take 25% of that, each flamingo provides 5 feathers (20 x 0.25 = 5).
7) To calculate the number of flamingoes needed, we divide the total number of feathers needed (2,400) by the number of feathers per flamingo (5): 2,400 / 5 = 480 flamingoes.

Answer: 480 flamingoes.
