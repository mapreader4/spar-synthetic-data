Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Annie ate 5 cookies.
2. On Tuesday, Annie ate two times more cookies than on Monday. That means she ate 2 x 5 = 10 cookies on Tuesday.
3. On Wednesday, Annie ate 40% more cookies than on Tuesday. 40% of 10 cookies is 0.4 x 10 = 4 cookies. So, she ate 10 + 4 = 14 cookies on Wednesday.

Now, to find the total number of cookies Annie ate during these three days, we add up the cookies she ate each day:
5 + 10 + 14 = 29 cookies

Answer: 29
