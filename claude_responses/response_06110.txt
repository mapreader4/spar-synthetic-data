Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ginger worked 8 hours in her garden
* Her water bottle held 2 cups of water
* She drank a full bottle (2 cups) every hour she was outside
* She also poured an additional 5 bottles of water over the new plants

To calculate the total cups of water used:
* For drinking, she drank 2 cups per hour for 8 hours, which is 2 x 8 = 16 cups
* For watering the plants, she used an additional 5 bottles, which is 5 x 2 = 10 cups

Adding the drinking and watering amounts together:
* 16 cups (drinking) + 10 cups (watering) = 26 cups

Answer: 26 cups
