Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Avianna bought red and blue candles in the ratio of 5:3.
2) This means that for every 5 red candles, there are 3 blue candles.
3) We know that Avianna had 45 red candles.
4) To find the number of blue candles, we need to set up a proportion:
5 red candles : 3 blue candles = 45 red candles : x blue candles
5) Cross-multiplying, we get:
5x = 45 * 3
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = 45 * 3 / 5
7) Simplifying, we get:
x = 27 blue candles.

Answer: 27
