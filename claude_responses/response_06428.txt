Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Percy swims 1 hour before school and 1 hour after school, 5 days a week.
* That means he swims 2 hours per day, 5 days a week.
* 2 hours per day x 5 days per week = 10 hours per week.
* He also swims 3 hours on the weekend.
* 3 hours on the weekend + 10 hours during the week = 13 hours per week.
* Over 4 weeks, that would be:
* 13 hours per week x 4 weeks = 52 hours.

Answer: 52
