Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The playground is surrounded by a square fence with a side length of 27 yards.
2) The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length.
3) So the perimeter of the playground fence is 4 * 27 = 108 yards.
4) The garden has a length of 12 yards and a width of 9 yards.
5) The perimeter of the garden is 2 * (12 + 9) = 42 yards.
6) To find the total fencing, we add the perimeter of the playground and the perimeter of the garden:
108 yards + 42 yards = 150 yards.

Answer: 150
