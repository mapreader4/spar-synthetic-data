Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John joins the country club with 3 other members of his family
* The fee to join is $4000 per person
* There is also a monthly cost of $1000 per person
* John pays half the cost

First, let's calculate the total cost to join the club:
* 4 people x $4000 per person = $16,000 total

Now, let's calculate the monthly cost for the first year:
* 4 people x $1000 per person per month = $4,000 per month
* $4,000 per month x 12 months = $48,000 total

Since John pays half the cost, we need to divide the total cost by 2:
* $16,000 + $48,000 = $64,000 total
* $64,000 / 2 = $32,000

Answer: $32,000
