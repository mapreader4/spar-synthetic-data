Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Clare's mother gave her $47 to go to the store.
2) Clare bought 4 loaves of bread, and each loaf costs $2.
   * So the total cost of the bread is 4 x $2 = $8.
3) Clare also bought 2 cartons of milk, and each carton costs $2.
   * So the total cost of the milk is 2 x $2 = $4.
4) The total amount Clare spent is the cost of the bread ($8) plus the cost of the milk ($4), which is $8 + $4 = $12.
5) Clare's mother gave her $47, and she spent $12, so the amount of money Clare has left is $47 - $12 = $35.
