Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kendra wears one shirt to school for each of the five weekdays, so that's 5 shirts per week.
* Three days a week, she changes into a different shirt for an after-school club, so that's 3 additional shirts per week.
* On Saturday, she wears one shirt all day, so that's 1 shirt per week.
* On Sunday, she wears a different shirt to church than she does for the rest of the day, so that's 2 shirts per week.
* In total, that's 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 11 shirts per week.
* Since Kendra wants to only do laundry once every two weeks, she needs enough shirts for two weeks.
* 11 shirts per week x 2 weeks = 22 shirts.

Answer: 22
