Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry needs to buy:
  - 2 liters of mustard oil at $13 per liter
  - 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta at $4 per pound
  - 1 pound of pasta sauce at $5 per pound
* To calculate the total cost of the items:
  - 2 liters of mustard oil at $13 per liter: 2 x $13 = $26
  - 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta at $4 per pound: 3 x $4 = $12
  - 1 pound of pasta sauce at $5 per pound: 1 x $5 = $5
* The total cost of the items is:
  - $26 + $12 + $5 = $43
* Jerry was given $50 to spend on the groceries.
* To calculate how much money Jerry will have left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $50 he was given:
  - $50 - $43 = $7
