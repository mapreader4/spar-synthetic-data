Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beckett is 12 years old.
2) Olaf is 3 years older than Beckett, so Olaf is 12 + 3 = 15 years old.
3) Shannen is 2 years younger than Olaf, so Shannen is 15 - 2 = 13 years old.
4) Jack is 5 more than twice as old as Shannen, so Jack is (2 x 13) + 5 = 31 years old.

Now, to find the sum of the ages of all 4 people:
Beckett: 12 years old
Olaf: 15 years old
Shannen: 13 years old
Jack: 31 years old

Sum of ages = 12 + 15 + 13 + 31 = 71

Answer: 71
