Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bran's tuition fee is $90.
2) He has a scholarship that takes care of 30% of his tuition fee. To calculate the amount covered by the scholarship, we take 30% of $90, which is $27.
3) So the amount Bran needs to pay is $90 - $27 = $63.
4) Bran's part-time job pays him $15 per month.
5) He needs to pay the tuition fee within 3 months, so he will earn $15 x 3 = $45 from his part-time job.
6) The amount Bran still needs to pay is $63 - $45 = $18.
