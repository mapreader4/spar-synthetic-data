Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Napoleon has 17 jelly beans.
2) Sedrich has 4 more jelly beans than Napoleon, so Sedrich has 17 + 4 = 21 jelly beans.
3) The sum of Napoleon and Sedrich's jelly beans is 17 + 21 = 38.
4) Twice the sum of Napoleon and Sedrich's jelly beans is 2 * 38 = 76.
5) The question states that 76 is 4 times the number of jelly beans that Mikey has.
6) Therefore, the number of jelly beans that Mikey has is 76 / 4 = 19.

Answer: 19
