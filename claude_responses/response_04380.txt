Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Malachi has the number of selfies he took last year and this year in the ratio of 10:17.
2) This means that the number of selfies he took last year is 10 parts, and the number of selfies he took this year is 17 parts.
3) The total number of parts is 10 + 17 = 27.
4) We know that Malachi has a total of 2430 photos in his gallery.
5) To find the number of photos he took last year, we can use the ratio:
* Last year's photos = (10/27) * 2430 = 900
6) To find the number of photos he took this year, we can use the ratio:
* This year's photos = (17/27) * 2430 = 1530
7) The difference between this year's photos and last year's photos is:
* 1530 - 900 = 630

Answer: 630
