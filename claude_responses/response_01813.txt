Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carrie harvested 200 tomatoes
* She can sell each tomato for $1
* So, the total revenue from selling the tomatoes would be:
    - 200 tomatoes x $1 per tomato = $200
* Carrie also harvested 350 carrots
* She can sell each carrot for $1.50
* So, the total revenue from selling the carrots would be:
    - 350 carrots x $1.50 per carrot = $525
* To calculate the total revenue, we add the revenue from the tomatoes and the revenue from the carrots:
    - $200 + $525 = $725

Answer: $725
