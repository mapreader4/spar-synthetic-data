Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes 20 minutes to paint one house
* We want to know how many houses can be painted in 3 hours
* 3 hours = 180 minutes
* To find the number of houses that can be painted in 180 minutes, we need to divide 180 by 20 (the number of minutes it takes to paint one house)
* 180 minutes / 20 minutes per house = 9 houses

Answer: 9
