Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Anna needs 8 red tulips for each eye, so that's 8 x 2 = 16 red tulips for the eyes.
2) Anna needs 18 red tulips for the smile.
3) The yellow background of the face requires 9 times the number of tulips in the smile, which is 9 x 18 = 162 yellow tulips.
4) To find the total number of tulips, we add the red tulips for the eyes (16) and the smile (18), plus the yellow tulips for the background (162):
16 + 18 + 162 = 196 tulips.

Answer: 196 tulips.
