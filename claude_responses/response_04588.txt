Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The business executive is gone for 4 days
* On the first day, he receives 16 new emails
* On each subsequent day, he receives half as many new emails as the prior day

So, let's calculate the number of new emails received each day:
* Day 1: 16 new emails
* Day 2: 16 / 2 = 8 new emails
* Day 3: 8 / 2 = 4 new emails
* Day 4: 4 / 2 = 2 new emails

Now, to find the total number of new emails received over the 4 days, we add up the emails received each day:
* Total new emails = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

Answer: 30
