Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Sally sold a total of 150 boxes on Saturday and Sunday
* She sold 50% more on Sunday than she did on Saturday
* Let's call the number of boxes she sold on Saturday as x
* Then the number of boxes she sold on Sunday would be 1.5x (50% more than Saturday)
* We know the total number of boxes sold on both days is 150, so we can set up an equation:
x + 1.5x = 150
* Solving for x, we get:
2.5x = 150
x = 60
Answer: 60 boxes
