Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The wife commits to saving $100 every week.
   * In 4 months (16 weeks), the wife will save 16 * $100 = $1,600.
2) The husband commits to saving $225 every month.
   * In 4 months, the husband will save 4 * $225 = $900.
3) The total amount saved by the couple is $1,600 + $900 = $2,500.
4) They decide to invest half of their money in stocks.
   * Half of $2,500 is $1,250.
5) Each share of stocks costs $50.
   * $1,250 / $50 = 25 shares.

Answer: 25 shares.
