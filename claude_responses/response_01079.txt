Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The television costs $400 if paid in cash.
2) If paying with a down payment and monthly installments, the down payment is $120 and the monthly payment is $30 for 12 months.
3) To calculate the total cost of the monthly installment plan, we need to add the down payment and the 12 monthly payments:
   - Down payment: $120
   - 12 monthly payments of $30 each: $30 x 12 = $360
   - Total cost of monthly installment plan: $120 + $360 = $480
4) To calculate the savings of paying cash, we take the total cost of the monthly installment plan ($480) and subtract the cash price ($400):
   - Savings = $480 - $400 = $80

Answer: $80
