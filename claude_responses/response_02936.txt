Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 516 cars in the parking lot
* One-third of the cars are blue
* To find the number of blue cars, we take one-third of 516:
    * 516 / 3 = 172 blue cars
* One-half of the cars are red
* To find the number of red cars, we take one-half of 516:
    * 516 / 2 = 258 red cars
* The remaining cars must be black
* To find the number of black cars, we subtract the blue and red cars from the total:
    * 516 - 172 - 258 = 86 black cars

Answer: 86
