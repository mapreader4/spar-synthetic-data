Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barry stands on his head for 10 minutes at a time
* After each 10-minute turn, he must sit for 5 minutes
* The total time period is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes

First, let's calculate the total time Barry can spend standing on his head during the 2-hour period:
* 120 minutes - (120 minutes / 15 minutes per turn * 5 minutes of sitting) = 80 minutes

Now, let's calculate how many 10-minute turns he can take during the 80 minutes:
* 80 minutes / 10 minutes per turn = 8 turns

Therefore, the number of turns Barry can take standing on his head during the 2-hour period is:

Answer: 8
