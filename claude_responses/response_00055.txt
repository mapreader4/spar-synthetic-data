Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have 25 roses, 40 tulips, and 35 daisies in the garden.
2) The total number of flowers in the garden is 25 + 40 + 35 = 100 flowers.
3) The number of flowers that are not roses is 40 tulips + 35 daisies = 75 flowers.
4) To calculate the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we take the number of flowers that are not roses (75) and divide it by the total number of flowers (100), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
5) 75 / 100 = 0.75
6) 0.75 * 100 = 75%

Answer: 75
