Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Steve reads 100 pages on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
* That means he reads 100 pages x 3 days = 300 pages per week
* The book is 2100 pages long
* To find how many weeks it takes to read the book, we divide the total pages (2100) by the number of pages read per week (300)
* 2100 pages / 300 pages per week = 7 weeks
