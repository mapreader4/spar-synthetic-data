Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dan has two times as many stickers as Tom.
2) Tom has 3 times as many stickers as Bob.
3) Bob has 12 stickers.
4) Since Tom has 3 times as many stickers as Bob, and Bob has 12 stickers, then Tom has 3 * 12 = 36 stickers.
5) Since Dan has two times as many stickers as Tom, and Tom has 36 stickers, then Dan has 2 * 36 = 72 stickers.

Answer: 72
