Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joey is 9 years old now
* In 5 years, Joey will be as old as Beth is now
* So, in 5 years, Joey will be 9 + 5 = 14 years old
* This means that when Joey was Beth's age now, Beth must have been 14 years old
* To find Joey's age when Beth was Joey's age now, we need to subtract 5 years from Beth's current age of 14
* Therefore, when Beth was Joey's age now, Joey was 14 - 5 = 9 years old

Answer: 9
