Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Let's define the variables:
  - Diaz's age is represented by 'x'
  - Sierra's age is represented by '30'
* The problem statement says:
  - 40 less than 10 times Diaz's age is 20 more than 10 times Sierra's age
* We can represent this mathematically as:
  - 10x - 40 = 10(30) + 20
  - 10x - 40 = 320 + 20
  - 10x - 40 = 340
  - 10x = 380
  - x = 38
* Therefore, Diaz's current age is 38 years old.
* The problem also asks how old Diaz will be 20 years from now.
* So, Diaz's age 20 years from now will be:
  - 38 + 20 = 58 years old.

Answer: 58
