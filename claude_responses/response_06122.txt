Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag. That means she has 4 * 20 = 80 apples in those 4 bags.
2) Ella also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag. That means she has 6 * 25 = 150 apples in those 6 bags.
3) In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples.
4) Ella sells 200 apples.
5) To find how many apples Ella has left, we take the total apples (230) and subtract the number of apples sold (200).
6) 230 - 200 = 30 apples left.

Answer: 30
