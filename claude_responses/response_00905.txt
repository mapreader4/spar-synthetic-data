Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The machine produces 30 cans of soda every 30 minutes
* We want to find how many cans the machine can produce in 8 hours
* 8 hours = 480 minutes
* In 30 minutes, the machine produces 30 cans
* So in 480 minutes (8 hours), the machine will produce:
* (480 minutes / 30 minutes) * 30 cans = 480 cans

Answer: 480
