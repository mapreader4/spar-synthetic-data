Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carla's original order cost is $7.50.
2) She has a coupon for $2.50, so the new cost after the coupon is $7.50 - $2.50 = $5.00.
3) She gets an additional 20% discount for being a senior citizen.
4) The 20% discount on $5.00 is 0.20 * $5.00 = $1.00.
5) The final cost after the discount is $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00.
