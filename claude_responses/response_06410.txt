Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

T-Mobile:
* The family plan costs $50 per month for the first two lines
* Each additional line costs $16
* Moore's family needs 5 lines, so that's 3 additional lines beyond the first two
* Total cost for T-Mobile = $50 + ($16 x 3) = $98 per month

M-Mobile:
* The family plan costs $45 for the first two lines
* Each additional line costs $14
* Moore's family needs 5 lines, so that's 3 additional lines beyond the first two
* Total cost for M-Mobile = $45 + ($14 x 3) = $87 per month

Now, to calculate the difference in cost:
* T-Mobile cost: $98 per month
* M-Mobile cost: $87 per month
* Difference in cost = $98 - $87 = $11 per month

Answer: $11
