Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Eithan received a $2000 stimulus check
* He gave 2/5 of the $2000 to his wife
* 2/5 of $2000 = 0.4 * $2000 = $800
* So his wife received $800
* The remaining amount after giving to his wife is $2000 - $800 = $1200
* He then gave 2/5 of the $1200 to his first son
* 2/5 of $1200 = 0.4 * $1200 = $480
* So his first son received $480
* The remaining amount after giving to his first son is $1200 - $480 = $720
* He then gave 40% of the $720 to his second son
* 40% of $720 = 0.4 * $720 = $288
* So his second son received $288
* The remaining amount after giving to his second son is $720 - $288 = $432
* Therefore, the total amount he kept in the family's savings account is $432

Answer: 432
