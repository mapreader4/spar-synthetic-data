Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John works 12 hours every other day. This means he works 12 hours for 15 days in a 30-day month (every other day).
2) His former hourly rate was $20 per hour.
3) He received a 30% raise, which means his new hourly rate is $20 + (0.30 * $20) = $26 per hour.
4) To calculate his monthly earnings, we multiply his new hourly rate by the number of hours he works in a 30-day month:
   * 12 hours per day x 15 days = 180 hours
   * 180 hours x $26 per hour = $4,680

Answer: $4,680
