Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom bought 10 packages of miniature racing cars.
2) Each package contains 5 cars.
3) So, the total number of cars Tom bought is 10 packages x 5 cars per package = 50 cars.
4) Tom gave each of his two nephews 1/5 of the cars.
5) 1/5 of 50 cars is 10 cars.
6) Tom gave 10 cars to each of his two nephews, so the total number of cars he gave away is 10 + 10 = 20 cars.
7) The number of cars left with Tom is the total number of cars he bought (50) minus the number of cars he gave away (20).
Answer: 30 cars
