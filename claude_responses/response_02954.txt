Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total number of spaces in the parking lot is 1000
* The parking lot is divided into 3 sections
* Section 1 has 320 spaces
* Section 2 has 200 more spaces than Section 3

To find the number of spaces in Section 2, we first need to find the number of spaces in Section 3.

We know that Section 2 has 200 more spaces than Section 3, so:
* Spaces in Section 2 = Spaces in Section 3 + 200

We also know that the total number of spaces in the parking lot is 1000, and we know the number of spaces in Section 1, so:
* Spaces in Section 1 + Spaces in Section 2 + Spaces in Section 3 = 1000
* 320 + (Spaces in Section 3 + 200) + Spaces in Section 3 = 1000
* 520 + 2 * Spaces in Section 3 = 1000
* 2 * Spaces in Section 3 = 1000 - 520
* Spaces in Section 3 = 240

Now that we know the number of spaces in Section 3, we can calculate the number of spaces in Section 2:
* Spaces in Section 2 = Spaces in Section 3 + 200
* Spaces in Section 2 = 240 + 200
* Spaces in Section 2 = 440

Answer: 440
