Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 centerpieces
* Each centerpiece uses 8 roses
* Each centerpiece uses twice as many orchids as roses
* Each centerpiece uses a certain number of lilies
* Each flower costs $15
* Martha wants to spend $2700 total

First, let's calculate the total number of roses needed:
* 6 centerpieces x 8 roses per centerpiece = 48 roses

Next, let's calculate the total number of orchids needed:
* 2 x 8 roses per centerpiece = 16 orchids per centerpiece
* 6 centerpieces x 16 orchids per centerpiece = 96 orchids

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the roses and orchids:
* 48 roses x $15 per rose = $720
* 96 orchids x $15 per orchid = $1440
* Total cost of roses and orchids = $720 + $1440 = $2160

Finally, we can calculate the number of lilies needed:
* Total budget = $2700
* Total cost of roses and orchids = $2160
* Remaining budget for lilies = $2700 - $2160 = $540
* Cost per lily = $15
* Number of lilies = $540 / $15 = 36 lilies
* Number of lilies per centerpiece = 36 lilies / 6 centerpieces = 6 lilies per centerpiece

Answer: 6 lilies per centerpiece.
