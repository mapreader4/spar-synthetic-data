Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Doris earns $20 per hour
* She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses
* She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
* Weekdays: 3 hours per day x 5 days = 15 hours
* Saturday: 5 hours
* Total hours per week = 15 + 5 = 20 hours
* Weekly earnings = 20 hours x $20 per hour = $400

Now, let's calculate how many weeks it will take for her to earn $1200:
* $1200 / $400 per week = 3 weeks

Therefore, it will take Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses.
