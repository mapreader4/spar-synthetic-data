Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 21 different cities with protests
* In each city, there are 10 arrests per day
* The protests last for 30 days
* Each person spends 4 days in jail before trial
* After the trial, each person spends half of a 2-week sentence

First, let's calculate the total number of arrests:
* 21 cities x 10 arrests per day x 30 days = 6,300 total arrests

Next, let's calculate the total number of days spent in jail before trial:
* 6,300 arrests x 4 days = 25,200 days

Finally, let's calculate the total number of days spent in jail after trial:
* 6,300 arrests x 1 week (half of 2-week sentence) = 44,100 days

Now, we can add the total days spent in jail before and after trial:
* 25,200 days + 44,100 days = 69,300 days

To convert this to weeks, we divide by 7 days per week:
* 69,300 days / 7 days per week = 9,900 weeks

Answer: 9,900 weeks
