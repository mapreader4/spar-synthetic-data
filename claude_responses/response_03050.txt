Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Janet bought some muffins at the bakery.
2) Each muffin costs 75 cents.
3) Janet paid $20 and got $11 in change back.
4) To find the total cost of the muffins, we can subtract the change ($11) from the amount Janet paid ($20):
$20 - $11 = $9
5) Since each muffin costs 75 cents, we can divide the total cost ($9) by the cost per muffin (75 cents) to find the number of muffins Janet bought:
$9 / $0.75 = 12 muffins

Answer: 12
