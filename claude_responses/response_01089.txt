Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Coleen started with 12 cans of sprinkles.
2) After using some of the sprinkles, she had 3 less than half as many cans as she started with.
3) To find how many cans she had left, we first need to find half of the original amount, which is 12 / 2 = 6 cans.
4) Then, we subtract 3 from that amount, so 6 - 3 = 3 cans.

Answer: 3 cans of sprinkles remained.
