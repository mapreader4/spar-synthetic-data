Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom rents a helicopter for 2 hours a day for 3 days.
2) The cost of renting the helicopter is $75 per hour.
3) To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the total number of hours rented.
4) The total number of hours rented is 2 hours per day for 3 days, which is 6 hours.
5) Therefore, the total cost is 6 hours x $75 per hour = $450.
