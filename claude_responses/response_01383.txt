Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Issac buys a total of 108 writing utensils.
2) He buys 12 more than 5 times the number of pencils than pens.
Let's represent the number of pens as x.
Then, the number of pencils is 5x + 12.
3) The total number of writing utensils is the sum of the pens and pencils:
x + (5x + 12) = 108
4) Solving this equation:
6x + 12 = 108
6x = 96
x = 16
Therefore, Issac bought 16 pens.

Answer: 16
