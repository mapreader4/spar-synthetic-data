Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first student guessed 100 jellybeans.
* The second student said there are 8 times as many, so their guess is 8 * 100 = 800 jellybeans.
* The third student guessed 200 less than the second student, so their guess is 800 - 200 = 600 jellybeans.
* The fourth student took the average of the first three guesses, which is (100 + 800 + 600) / 3 = 500.
* The fourth student then added 25 to the average, so their final guess is 500 + 25 = 525 jellybeans.

Answer: 525
