Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Frank bakes a pan of brownies and cuts it into 6 even columns and 3 even rows.
2) This means the pan is divided into a total of 6 x 3 = 18 individual brownies.
3) There are 6 people, including Frank, who will be eating the brownies.
4) To find how many brownies each person can eat, we divide the total number of brownies (18) by the number of people (6).
5) 18 brownies / 6 people = 3 brownies per person.
