Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Andrea has 4 erasers.
2) Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea.
3) To find how many erasers Anya has, we multiply Andrea's 4 erasers by 4: 4 x 4 = 16 erasers.
4) To find how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea, we subtract Andrea's 4 erasers from Anya's 16 erasers: 16 - 4 = 12 more erasers.

Answer: 12
