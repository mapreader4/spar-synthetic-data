Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary uses 3 square feet of paint to paint the dragon.
2) Mike uses 2 square feet more than Mary, so he uses 3 + 2 = 5 square feet of paint to paint the castle.
3) The total amount of paint used so far is 3 + 5 = 8 square feet.
4) The original amount of paint in the jar was 13 square feet.
5) The remaining amount of paint available to paint the sun is 13 - 8 = 5 square feet.

Answer: 5 square feet
