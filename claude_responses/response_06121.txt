Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Delta Airlines flight:
   - Original price: $850
   - Discount: 20%
   - Discounted price: $850 - (20% of $850) = $850 - $170 = $680

2. United Airlines flight:
   - Original price: $1100
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discounted price: $1100 - (30% of $1100) = $1100 - $330 = $770

3. Comparing the two discounted prices:
   - Delta Airlines flight: $680
   - United Airlines flight: $770
   - The Delta Airlines flight is cheaper by $90.

Therefore, Carrie would save $90 by choosing the cheapest flight.

Answer: $90
