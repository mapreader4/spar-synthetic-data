Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 8 more solar systems for every planet in the galaxy
* There are 20 planets in the galaxy
* To find the total number of solar systems, we need to multiply the number of planets (20) by the number of solar systems per planet (8)
* 20 planets x 8 solar systems per planet = 160 solar systems
* To find the total number of planets, we know there are 20 planets
* Therefore, the total number of solar systems and planets is the sum of the number of solar systems (160) and the number of planets (20)
* 160 solar systems + 20 planets = 180 total

Answer: 180
