Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The password is made up of several kinds of alphanumeric and symbol characters.
2) The first part of the password is a string of eight random lowercase letters.
3) The second part of the password is a string half that length (4 characters) of alternating upper case letters and numbers.
4) There is one symbol on each end of the password.

To calculate the total number of characters in the password:
* 8 lowercase letters
* 4 alternating upper case letters and numbers
* 2 symbols (one on each end)
* Total characters = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14

Answer: 14
