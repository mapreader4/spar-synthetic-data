Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The blue basket has 12 bananas and 4 apples, so the total number of fruits in the blue basket is 12 + 4 = 16 fruits.
2) The red basket holds half as many fruits as the blue basket.
3) Half of 16 is 8.
Therefore, the number of fruits in the red basket is 8.

Answer: 8
