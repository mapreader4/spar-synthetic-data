Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mike has earned a total of $160 in wages this week
* He has two jobs
* For his second job, he works 12 hours per week
* His second job pays $9 per hour

To find out how much he earned from his first job, we need to first calculate how much he earned from his second job:
* Earnings from second job = 12 hours per week x $9 per hour = $108 per week

Now, we can subtract the earnings from his second job from the total earnings to find the earnings from his first job:
* Total earnings = $160
* Earnings from second job = $108
* Earnings from first job = $160 - $108 = $52

Therefore, the amount of money Mike received from his first job is:
Answer: $52
