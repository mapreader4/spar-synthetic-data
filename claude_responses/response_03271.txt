Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Sydney sends 5 texts to Allison and 5 texts to Brittney.
* So the total number of texts sent on Monday is 5 + 5 = 10 texts.
* On Tuesday, Sydney sends 15 texts to Allison and 15 texts to Brittney.
* So the total number of texts sent on Tuesday is 15 + 15 = 30 texts.
* To find the total number of texts sent on both days, we add the number of texts sent on Monday and Tuesday:
* 10 texts + 30 texts = 40 texts.

Answer: 40
