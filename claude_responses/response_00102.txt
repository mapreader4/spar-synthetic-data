Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ellie needs 10ml of oil to fix each wheel
* She has 2 wheels on the bicycle
* So for the 2 wheels, she needs 2 x 10ml = 20ml of oil
* Additionally, she needs 5ml of oil to fix the rest of the bike
* To find the total amount of oil needed, we add the amount needed for the wheels and the rest of the bike:
* 20ml + 5ml = 25ml

Answer: 25
