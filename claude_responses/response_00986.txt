Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Camden went swimming 16 times in March
* Susannah went swimming 24 times in March
* The total number of times they went swimming is 16 + 24 = 40 times
* The number of times they went swimming was divided equally among 4 weeks
* To find the number of times they went swimming per week, we divide the total (40) by the number of weeks (4)
* 40 / 4 = 10 times per week
* Susannah went swimming 24 times in the month, so she went 24 / 4 = 6 times per week
* Camden went swimming 16 times in the month, so he went 16 / 4 = 4 times per week
* The difference between Susannah's and Camden's weekly swimming is 6 - 4 = 2 times per week
