Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kelly has 8 students, and each student needs 3 pieces of construction paper.
2) So the total number of construction paper pieces needed is 8 students x 3 pieces = 24 pieces.
3) In addition, Kelly needs to buy 6 bottles of glue for everyone to share.
4) So the total number of supplies Kelly initially bought is 24 pieces of construction paper + 6 bottles of glue = 30 supplies.
5) Kelly then dropped half of the supplies down a storm drain, so she lost 15 supplies.
6) Kelly then rushed to the store and bought 5 more pieces of construction paper.
7) So the total number of supplies left is 30 - 15 + 5 = 20 supplies.

Answer: 20
