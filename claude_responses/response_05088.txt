Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barbara bought 5 packs of tuna at $2 each
* So the total cost of the tuna is 5 x $2 = $10
* Barbara also bought 4 bottles of water at $1.5 each
* So the total cost of the water is 4 x $1.5 = $6
* The total amount Barbara paid for her shopping was $56
* To find the amount she spent on different goods, we need to subtract the cost of the tuna and water from the total amount paid:
* $56 - $10 - $6 = $40

Answer: $40
