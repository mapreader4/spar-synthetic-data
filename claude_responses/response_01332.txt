Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mehki is 10 years older than Jordyn.
2) Jordyn's age is double Zrinka's age.
3) Zrinka is 6 years old.

First, let's find Jordyn's age:
* Jordyn's age is double Zrinka's age
* Zrinka is 6 years old
* Therefore, Jordyn is 2 x 6 = 12 years old

Now, we can find Mehki's age:
* Mehki is 10 years older than Jordyn
* Jordyn is 12 years old
* Therefore, Mehki is 12 + 10 = 22 years old

Answer: 22
