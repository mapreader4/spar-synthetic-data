Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kelsey turned 25 in 1999
* This means Kelsey was born in 1974 (1999 - 25 = 1974)
* Kelsey's older sister was born 3 years before Kelsey, so in 1971 (1974 - 3 = 1971)
* It's currently 2021
* To find the age of Kelsey's older sister, we need to subtract her birth year from the current year:
* 2021 - 1971 = 50

Answer: 50
