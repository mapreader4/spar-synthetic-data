Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recipe calls for 1 cup of chickpeas per serving
* There are 6 ounces of chickpeas in 1 cup
* There are 16 ounces of chickpeas in 1 can
* To make 20 servings, we need 20 cups of chickpeas
* Since there are 6 ounces of chickpeas per cup, we need 20 * 6 = 120 ounces of chickpeas
* Since there are 16 ounces of chickpeas per can, we need 120 / 16 = 7.5 cans of chickpeas
* Since we can't buy a fraction of a can, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 8 cans of chickpeas.
