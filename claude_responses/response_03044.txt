Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Tom has 10 pounds of beef.
2) It takes twice as many noodles as beef to make lasagna.
3) So, he needs 20 pounds of noodles (2 x 10 pounds of beef).
4) He already has 4 pounds of noodles.
5) So, he needs to buy an additional 16 pounds of noodles (20 pounds - 4 pounds).
6) The noodles come in 2-pound packages.
7) Therefore, he needs to buy 8 packages of noodles (16 pounds / 2 pounds per package).

Answer: 8
