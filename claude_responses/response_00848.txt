Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* We know that on average, every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week.
* We also know that in 5 weeks, the cows produced 2160 liters of milk.
* To find the number of cows on the farm, we need to first find the average amount of milk produced per week.
* To do this, we divide the total amount of milk produced (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5).
* 2160 liters / 5 weeks = 432 liters per week.
* Now we know that every 6 cows produce 108 liters per week on average.
* So we can divide the average weekly production (432 liters) by the average production per 6 cows (108 liters) to get the number of groups of 6 cows.
* 432 liters / 108 liters per 6 cows = 4 groups of 6 cows.
* Therefore, the total number of cows on the farm is 4 groups of 6 cows, which is 24 cows.
