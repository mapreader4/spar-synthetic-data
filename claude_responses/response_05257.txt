Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A pad of paper comes with 60 sheets
* Evelyn uses a pad of paper writing notes at work every week
* She takes Monday and Friday off from work
* So, she works 3 days per week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)
* In a week, she uses 60 sheets of paper
* To find the number of sheets used per day, we divide the total sheets used per week (60) by the number of work days per week (3)
* 60 sheets / 3 days = 20 sheets per day

Answer: 20
