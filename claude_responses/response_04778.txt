Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The initial price of the phone was $600.
2) Karsyn bought the phone at 20% of the initial price.
3) To calculate 20% of $600, we can multiply $600 by 0.20 (20% expressed as a decimal):
$600 x 0.20 = $120
4) Therefore, Karsyn paid $120 for the phone after negotiating.

Answer: 120
