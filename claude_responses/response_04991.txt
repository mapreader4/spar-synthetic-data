Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 200 students in the school
* 60% of the students are boys, which means 120 students are boys (60% of 200)
* The remaining 40% of the students are girls, which means 80 students are girls (40% of 200)
* June receives 67.5% of the male vote, which means she gets 67.5% of 120 votes, or 81 votes from the boys
* To win the election, June needs just over 50% of the total vote, which means she needs more than 101 votes (50% of 200 + 1)
* The remaining votes she needs to win must come from the female students
* Let's call the percentage of the female vote that June receives as x%
* The number of votes she gets from the female students is 80 * x%
* To win the election, the total number of votes she gets must be greater than 101:
   - 81 (from the boys) + 80 * x% > 101
   - 80 * x% > 101 - 81
   - 80 * x% > 20
   - x% > 20/80
   - x% > 25%
* Therefore, the smallest percentage of the female vote that June must receive to win the election is 25.1%.

Answer: 25.1%
