Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carrie worked for 2 hours a day for 4 days to make and decorate the wedding cake.
2) She was paid $22 an hour.
3) The total number of hours she worked is 2 hours per day x 4 days = 8 hours.
4) Her total earnings for the 8 hours of work is 8 hours x $22 per hour = $176.
5) The cost for supplies to make the cake was $54.
6) To calculate the profit, we take the total earnings ($176) and subtract the cost of supplies ($54).
