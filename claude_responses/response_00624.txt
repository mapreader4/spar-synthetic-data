Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery.
2) Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia.
3) To find how many pieces of stationery Lorene has, we multiply Georgia's amount by 3:
   * Lorene's stationery = 3 x 25 = 75 pieces
4) To find how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene, we subtract Georgia's amount from Lorene's amount:
   * Fewer pieces = Lorene's stationery - Georgia's stationery
   * Fewer pieces = 75 - 25 = 50

Answer: 50
