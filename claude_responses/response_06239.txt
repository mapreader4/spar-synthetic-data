Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Vlad is 6 feet, 3 inches tall. To convert this to inches, we multiply 6 feet by 12 inches/foot, which gives us 72 inches. Then we add the 3 inches, which gives us a total of 75 inches for Vlad's height.
2) Vlad's sister is 2 feet, 10 inches tall. To convert this to inches, we multiply 2 feet by 12 inches/foot, which gives us 24 inches. Then we add the 10 inches, which gives us a total of 34 inches for the sister's height.
3) To find how much taller Vlad is than his sister, we subtract the sister's height from Vlad's height:
75 inches - 34 inches = 41 inches.

Answer: 41 inches
