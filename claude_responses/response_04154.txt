Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The pyramid has 4 layers.
2) The top layer is a single block.
3) Each layer has three times as many sandstone blocks as the layer above it.
4) Let's start with the top layer, which has 1 block.
5) The second layer has 3 times as many blocks as the top layer, so it has 3 blocks.
6) The third layer has 3 times as many blocks as the second layer, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 blocks.
7) The fourth layer has 3 times as many blocks as the third layer, so it has 3 * 9 = 27 blocks.
8) To find the total number of blocks, we add up the blocks in each layer:
1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.

Answer: 40
