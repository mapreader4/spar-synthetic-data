To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a candidate knowing Excel and being willing to work nights.

Given information:
- 20% of the job candidates have experience with Excel.
- 70% of the candidates are only willing to work day shifts.

To find the probability of a candidate knowing Excel and being willing to work nights, we need to find the intersection of these two events.

The probability of a candidate knowing Excel and being willing to work nights is the probability of the candidate knowing Excel multiplied by the probability of the candidate being willing to work nights.

The probability of a candidate knowing Excel is 20% or 0.20.
The probability of a candidate being willing to work nights is the complement of the probability of a candidate being willing to work day shifts, which is 1 - 0.70 = 0.30.

Therefore, the probability of a candidate knowing Excel and being willing to work nights is:
Probability = 0.20 Ã— 0.30 = 0.06
