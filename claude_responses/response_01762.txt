Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) 75% of the cars have valid tickets. 75% of 300 cars is 0.75 * 300 = 225 cars with valid tickets.
2) 1/5th of the 225 cars with valid tickets have permanent parking passes. 1/5 of 225 is 225 / 5 = 45 cars with permanent parking passes.
3) The total number of cars that paid for parking is the sum of the cars with valid tickets and the cars with permanent parking passes: 225 + 45 = 270 cars.
4) The number of cars that tried to park without paying is the total number of cars (300) minus the number of cars that paid for parking (270): 300 - 270 = 30 cars.

Answer: 30
