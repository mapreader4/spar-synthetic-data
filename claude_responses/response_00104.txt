Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 boat trips through the lake per day
* The boat can take up to 12 people during one trip
* We want to know how many people the boat can transport in 2 days

To calculate the total number of people the boat can transport in 2 days, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of people the boat can transport in 1 day
2. Multiply that number by 2 to get the number of people the boat can transport in 2 days

Step 1: Calculating the number of people the boat can transport in 1 day
* 4 boat trips per day
* 12 people per trip
* 4 trips x 12 people = 48 people per day

Step 2: Calculating the number of people the boat can transport in 2 days
* 48 people per day
* 2 days
* 48 people x 2 days = 96 people

Answer: 96
