Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Clara starts with 100 stickers.
2) She gives 10 stickers to a boy she likes.
3) So, after giving away 10 stickers, she has 100 - 10 = 90 stickers left.
4) She then gives half of the 90 stickers to her best friends.
5) Half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 stickers.
6) So, she gives away 45 stickers to her best friends.
7) After giving away the 45 stickers, she has 90 - 45 = 45 stickers left.

Answer: 45
