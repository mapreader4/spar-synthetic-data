Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kyle is 5 years older than Julian.
2) Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick.
3) Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson.
4) Tyson is 20 years old.

First, let's find out how old Frederick is:
* Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson, and Tyson is 20 years old.
* Therefore, Frederick is 2 * 20 = 40 years old.

Next, let's find out how old Julian is:
* Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick.
* Therefore, Julian is 40 - 20 = 20 years old.

Finally, let's find out how old Kyle is:
* Kyle is 5 years older than Julian.
* Julian is 20 years old.
* Therefore, Kyle is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Answer: 25
