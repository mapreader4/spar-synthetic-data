Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brendan earned $5000 in June
* He recharges his debit card with half of his pay, which is $5000 / 2 = $2500
* He bought a used car worth $1500
* To find his remaining money, we need to subtract the cost of the car from the remaining amount after recharging his debit card
* Remaining money = Total earnings - Debit card recharge - Cost of car
* Remaining money = $5000 - $2500 - $1500 = $1000

Answer: 1000
