Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John climbs up 3 flights of stairs, and each flight is 10 feet. So the total height of the stairs is:
3 flights x 10 feet per flight = 30 feet
2) He then climbs a rope that is half the height of the stairs. The height of the rope is:
30 feet / 2 = 15 feet
3) Finally, he climbs a ladder that is 10 feet longer than the rope. The height of the ladder is:
15 feet + 10 feet = 25 feet
4) Adding up the heights of the stairs, rope, and ladder, we get:
30 feet + 15 feet + 25 feet = 70 feet

Answer: 70
