Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 15 tables in the school's cafeteria
* Each table can seat 10 people
* So the total number of seats in the cafeteria is 15 tables x 10 seats per table = 150 seats
* Usually, only 1/10 of the seats are left unseated
* That means 9/10 of the seats are usually taken
* To calculate the number of seats usually taken, we take 9/10 of the total seats:
* 9/10 x 150 seats = 135 seats

Answer: 135
