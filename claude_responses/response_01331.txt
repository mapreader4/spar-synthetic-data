Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jane's goal is to exercise 1 hour a day, 5 days a week.
* This means that in a single week, Jane exercises for 1 hour x 5 days = 5 hours.
* Jane hits her goal weekly for 8 weeks.
* So, the total number of hours Jane has exercised is:
* 5 hours per week x 8 weeks = 40 hours.
