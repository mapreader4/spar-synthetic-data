Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The rent for the whole apartment is $1100 per month
* The utilities for the whole apartment are $114 per month
* The two roommates split the rent and utilities equally
* One roommate pays $757 in total each month

To find the total amount for groceries, we need to first calculate the total monthly expenses for the apartment.

The total monthly expenses are:
* Rent: $1100
* Utilities: $114
* Total: $1100 + $114 = $1214

Since the two roommates split the expenses equally, each roommate's share of the rent and utilities is:
* $1214 / 2 = $607

We know that one roommate pays $757 in total each month. So, the amount they pay for groceries is:
* $757 - $607 = $150

Since the roommates split the grocery costs equally, the total amount spent on groceries for the whole apartment is:
* $150 x 2 = $300

Answer: $300
