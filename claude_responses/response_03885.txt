Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James scored 13 field goals worth 3 points each
* So for the field goals, he scored 13 x 3 = 39 points
* James also scored 20 shots worth 2 points each
* So for the 20 shots, he scored 20 x 2 = 40 points
* To calculate the total points, we add the points from the field goals and the points from the shots:
* 39 points + 40 points = 79 points

Answer: 79
