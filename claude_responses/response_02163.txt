Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Miles has fewer trumpets than he has fingers
* He has 3 fewer trumpets than he has fingers
* We can assume that Miles has 10 fingers, as that is the typical number of fingers for a human
* Therefore, Miles has 10 - 3 = 7 trumpets

* Miles has 2 more guitars than he has hands
* We can assume that Miles has 2 hands, as that is the typical number of hands for a human
* Therefore, Miles has 2 + 2 = 4 guitars

* Miles has 2 more trombones than he has heads
* We can assume that Miles has 1 head, as that is the typical number of heads for a human
* Therefore, Miles has 1 + 2 = 3 trombones

* Miles has 1 fewer French horn than he has guitars
* We determined that Miles has 4 guitars
* Therefore, Miles has 4 - 1 = 3 French horns

Now, let's add up the total number of musical instruments that Miles owns:
* 7 trumpets + 4 guitars + 3 trombones + 3 French horns = 17 musical instruments

Answer: 17
