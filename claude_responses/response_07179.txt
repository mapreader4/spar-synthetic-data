Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) We have 3 baskets: A, B, and C.
2) Basket A contains 4 red marbles and 2 yellow marbles.
3) Basket B contains 6 green marbles and 1 yellow marble.
4) Basket C contains 3 white marbles and 9 yellow marbles.

To find the difference between the number of each color of marble in the basket that has the greatest difference, we need to:
1) Identify the basket with the greatest difference between the number of each color of marble.
2) Calculate the difference between the number of each color of marble in that basket.

Looking at the contents of each basket:
- Basket A has a difference of 2 between red and yellow marbles.
- Basket B has a difference of 5 between green and yellow marbles.
- Basket C has a difference of 6 between white and yellow marbles.

Basket C has the greatest difference between the number of each color of marble, with a difference of 6 between white and yellow marbles.

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 6
