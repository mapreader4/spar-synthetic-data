Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 10 friends who planned to split the cost of the gift equally
* However, 4 of the friends dropped out, leaving 6 friends to split the cost
* The remaining 6 friends now have to pay $8 more per share
* Let's call the original cost of the gift 'x'
* Initially, each friend would have paid x/10 for the gift
* Now, each of the 6 remaining friends is paying x/6 + $8
* We can set up an equation to solve for the original cost 'x':
* x/10 = x/6 + $8
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = $80
* Therefore, the cost of the gift is $80.

Answer: $80
