Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Herman feeds the birds in December, January, and February
* He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon
* So, for each day, he feeds them a total of 1 cup (1/2 cup in the morning + 1/2 cup in the afternoon)
* There are 31 days in December, 31 days in January, and 28 days in February (assuming it's not a leap year)
* So, the total number of days he feeds the birds is:
  - December: 31 days
  - January: 31 days
  - February: 28 days
  - Total: 31 + 31 + 28 = 90 days
* Since he feeds them 1 cup per day, the total number of cups of food he will need is:
  - 90 days x 1 cup per day = 90 cups

Answer: 90
