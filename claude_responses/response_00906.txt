Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* At the first stop, 7 people got on the bus.
* At the second stop, 3 people got off, and 5 people got on.
  * So the net change is 5 - 3 = 2 more people on the bus.
* At the third stop, 2 people got off, and 4 people got on.
  * So the net change is 4 - 2 = 2 more people on the bus.

Now, let's add up the total number of people on the bus:
* Initially, 7 people got on at the first stop.
* Then, 2 more people got on at the second stop.
* And 2 more people got on at the third stop.
* So the total number of passengers on the bus is:
  * 7 + 2 + 2 = 11

Answer: 11
