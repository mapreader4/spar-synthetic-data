Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mary originally had 400 sheep on her farm.
2) She gave a quarter (1/4) of her sheep to her sister. 1/4 of 400 is 100, so she gave 100 sheep to her sister.
3) After giving 100 sheep to her sister, Mary had 400 - 100 = 300 sheep remaining.
4) Mary then gave half (1/2) of the remaining 300 sheep to her brother. 1/2 of 300 is 150, so she gave 150 sheep to her brother.
5) After giving 150 sheep to her brother, Mary had 300 - 150 = 150 sheep remaining.

Answer: 150
