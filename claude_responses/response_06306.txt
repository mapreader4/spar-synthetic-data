Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Apples weigh 4 ounces each, and oranges weigh 3 ounces each.
2) Each bag can hold 49 ounces of fruit before it splits.
3) Marta wants to put an equal number of apples and oranges in each bag.
4) Marta wants to buy 3 full bags of fruit.
5) To find the total ounces of apples Marta should buy, we need to first find the total ounces of fruit in 3 full bags.
6) 3 full bags x 49 ounces per bag = 147 ounces of total fruit.
7) Since Marta wants an equal number of apples and oranges, the total ounces of apples and oranges should be equal.
8) So the total ounces of apples should be 147/2 = 73.5 ounces.
9) Since we need a whole number of apples, we round up to the nearest integer.

Answer: 74 ounces of apples.
