Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The married couple consists of 2 people
* The couple want 3 slices each, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 slices for the couple
* There are 6 children
* Each child wants 1 slice, so that's 6 x 1 = 6 slices for the children
* In total, they want 6 + 6 = 12 slices
* Each pizza has 4 slices
* To calculate the number of pizzas they should order, we divide the total number of slices needed (12) by the number of slices per pizza (4)
* 12 / 4 = 3
