Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beatrix has 30 books.
2) Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix, so Alannah has 30 + 20 = 50 books.
3) Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah, so Queen has 50 + (1/5 * 50) = 50 + 10 = 60 books.
4) To find the total number of books the three have together, we add up the number of books each person has:
Beatrix: 30 books
Alannah: 50 books
Queen: 60 books
Total: 30 + 50 + 60 = 140 books

Answer: 140
