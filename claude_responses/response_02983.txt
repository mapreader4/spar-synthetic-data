Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jacob's water tank can hold up to 50 liters of water.
2) Jacob can collect 800 milliliters of water from the rain and 1700 milliliters of water from the river every day.
3) To find the total amount of water Jacob can collect per day, we add the two amounts:
   800 milliliters + 1700 milliliters = 2500 milliliters
4) To convert 50 liters to milliliters, we multiply 50 by 1000:
   50 liters x 1000 milliliters/liter = 50,000 milliliters
5) To find how many days it will take Jacob to fill up his water tank, we divide the total capacity of the tank (50,000 milliliters) by the amount of water he can collect per day (2,500 milliliters):
   50,000 milliliters / 2,500 milliliters per day = 20 days

Answer: 20
