Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 500 people attended the band concert
* The band gets 70% of the ticket price
* Each ticket costs $30
* There are 4 members of the band

First, we need to calculate the total revenue from ticket sales:
* Total revenue = 500 people x $30 per ticket = $15,000

Next, we need to calculate the amount the band gets, which is 70% of the total revenue:
* Band's share = 70% of $15,000 = 0.7 x $15,000 = $10,500

Finally, we need to divide the band's share by the number of band members to get the amount each member gets:
* Amount per band member = $10,500 / 4 members = $2,625

Answer: $2,625
