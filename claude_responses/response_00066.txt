Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The laptop costs $1000.
2) The computer shop requires a 20% down payment.
3) The 20% down payment is 0.2 * $1000 = $200.
4) Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, so her total down payment is $200 + $20 = $220.
5) The remaining balance after the down payment is $1000 - $220 = $780.
6) The monthly installment payment is $65.
7) Tara has paid for 4 months, so the total amount paid so far is 4 * $65 = $260.
8) The remaining balance after 4 months of payments is $780 - $260 = $520.

Answer: 520
