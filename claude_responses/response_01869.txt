Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Francie receives $5 a week for 8 weeks, so her total earnings from the first 8 weeks is:
   $5 x 8 weeks = $40
2) Francie then receives $6 a week for 6 weeks, so her total earnings from the next 6 weeks is:
   $6 x 6 weeks = $36
3) Her total earnings over the 14 weeks is:
   $40 + $36 = $76
4) Francie uses half of the $76 to buy new clothes, so she spends:
   $76 / 2 = $38 on clothes
5) The remaining money is:
   $76 - $38 = $38
6) Francie then buys a video game that costs $35, so the amount of money she has remaining is:
   $38 - $35 = $3
