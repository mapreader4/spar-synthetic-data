Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 90 people at the summer picnic
* There were 50 soda cans, 50 plastic bottles of sparkling water, and 50 glass bottles of juice
* One-half of the guests drank soda
* One-third of the guests drank sparkling water
* Four-fifths of the juices were consumed

First, let's calculate how many people drank soda:
* One-half of 90 people = 45 people

Next, let's calculate how many people drank sparkling water:
* One-third of 90 people = 30 people

Finally, let's calculate how many glass bottles of juice were consumed:
* Four-fifths of 50 glass bottles = 40 glass bottles

Now, we can add up the total number of recyclable cans and bottles collected:
* 45 soda cans + 30 plastic bottles of sparkling water + 40 glass bottles of juice = 115 recyclable cans and bottles

Answer: 115
