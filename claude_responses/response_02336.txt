Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Latia wants to buy a Samsung TV worth $1700.
2) She works for a delivery service company for a month, earning $10 per hour for a 30-hour workweek.
3) To calculate her monthly earnings, we multiply her hourly rate ($10) by the number of hours she works per week (30) and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month (4).
4) Monthly earnings = $10 x 30 x 4 = $1200
5) To calculate the additional hours she needs to work to buy the TV, we divide the cost of the TV ($1700) by her hourly rate ($10).
6) Additional hours needed = $1700 / $10 = 170 hours

Answer: 170 hours
