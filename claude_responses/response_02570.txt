Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kenneth spent 10% of his earnings on a new joystick
* This means he has 90% of his earnings left
* We know he has $405 left after the purchase
* To find his total earnings, we need to divide $405 by 0.9 (90% of his earnings)
* $405 / 0.9 = $450

Answer: 450
