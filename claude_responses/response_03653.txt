Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mrs. Jackson has 4 boxes of Christmas decorations.
2) Each box contains 15 decorations.
3) To find the total number of decorations, we multiply the number of boxes (4) by the number of decorations in each box (15):
4 boxes x 15 decorations per box = 60 total decorations
4) Mrs. Jackson was only able to use 35 decorations.
5) To find the number of decorations she gave to her neighbor, we subtract the number of decorations she used (35) from the total number of decorations (60):
60 total decorations - 35 decorations used = 25 decorations given to neighbor

Answer: 25
