Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In 2004, there were 60 kids at the cookout.

2. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004.
   * In 2004, there were 60 kids.
   * Half of 60 is 30.
   * So in 2005, there were 30 kids at the cookout.

3. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005.
   * In 2005, there were 30 kids.
   * 2/3 of 30 is 20.
   * So in 2006, there were 20 kids at the cookout.

Answer: 20
