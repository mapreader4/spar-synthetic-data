Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda
* Candice read 18 books
* Therefore, Amanda read 18 / 3 = 6 books
* Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read
* Kara read 6 / 2 = 3 books
* Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read
* Patricia read 7 * 3 = 21 books

Answer: 21
