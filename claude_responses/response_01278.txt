Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The green yarn is 156 cm long.
2) The red yarn is 8 cm more than three times the length of the green yarn.
3) To find the length of the red yarn, we first need to calculate three times the length of the green yarn:
   3 x 156 cm = 468 cm
4) Then, we add 8 cm to that to get the length of the red yarn:
   468 cm + 8 cm = 476 cm
5) To find the total length of the two pieces of yarn, we add the length of the green yarn and the length of the red yarn:
   156 cm + 476 cm = 632 cm

Answer: 632
