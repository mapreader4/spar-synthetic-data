Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt skips ropes 3 times per second
* He jumped for 10 minutes
* To find the total number of skips, we need to:
  1. Convert the time from minutes to seconds
  2. Multiply the number of seconds by the number of skips per second

Step 1: Convert 10 minutes to seconds
* 10 minutes = 10 x 60 seconds = 600 seconds

Step 2: Multiply the number of seconds by the number of skips per second
* 600 seconds x 3 skips/second = 1,800 skips

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 1,800
