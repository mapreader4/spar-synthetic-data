Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The price of candy bars is twice the cost of caramel. If the price of 1 caramel is $3, then the price of 1 candy bar is 2 * $3 = $6.
2) The cost of cotton candy is half the price of 4 candy bars. Since the price of 1 candy bar is $6, the price of 4 candy bars is 4 * $6 = $24. Half of $24 is $12, so the price of 1 cotton candy is $12.
3) Now, we need to calculate the total cost of 6 candy bars, 3 caramel, and 1 cotton candy.
* 6 candy bars at $6 each is 6 * $6 = $36
* 3 caramel at $3 each is 3 * $3 = $9
* 1 cotton candy at $12 is $12
* Total cost = $36 + $9 + $12 = $57

Answer: $57
