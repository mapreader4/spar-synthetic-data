Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sandro has six times as many daughters as sons.
2) He currently has three sons.
3) Since he has six times as many daughters as sons, and he has 3 sons, he must have 6 x 3 = 18 daughters.
4) Therefore, the total number of children Sandro has is 3 sons + 18 daughters = 21 children.

Answer: 21
