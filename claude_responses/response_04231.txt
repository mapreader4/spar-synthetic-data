Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Olaf has 25 men, including himself, on the boat.
2) Each man needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day.
3) The boat can travel 200 miles per day.
4) Olaf needs to travel 4,000 miles.

To calculate the total number of gallons of water needed, we need to:
1) Calculate the number of days it will take to travel 4,000 miles.
2) Multiply the number of days by the number of men and the amount of water needed per man per day.

Step 1: Calculating the number of days to travel 4,000 miles.
* The boat can travel 200 miles per day.
* 4,000 miles / 200 miles per day = 20 days

Step 2: Calculating the total amount of water needed.
* 25 men x 1/2 gallon per day x 20 days = 250 gallons

Answer: 250 gallons
