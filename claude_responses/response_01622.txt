Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jose needs 12 tablespoons of lemon juice to make a dozen (12) cupcakes.
2) Every lemon provides 4 tablespoons of lemon juice.
3) To make 3 dozen (36) cupcakes, Jose will need 3 times the amount of lemon juice as for 1 dozen cupcakes.
4) 3 dozen cupcakes x 12 tablespoons per dozen = 36 tablespoons of lemon juice needed.
5) 36 tablespoons of lemon juice / 4 tablespoons per lemon = 9 lemons needed.

Answer: 9 lemons.
