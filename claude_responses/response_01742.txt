Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) On Monday, Jean answered 35 phone calls.
2) On Tuesday, she answered 46 phone calls.
3) On Wednesday, she answered 27 phone calls.
4) On Thursday, she answered 61 phone calls.
5) On Friday, she answered 31 phone calls.

To calculate the average number of calls she answers per day, we need to:
1) Add up the total number of calls she answered over the 5 days.
2) Divide that total by the number of days (5).

The total number of calls she answered is:
35 + 46 + 27 + 61 + 31 = 200 calls

Now, we divide the total by the number of days:
200 calls / 5 days = 40 calls per day

Answer: 40
