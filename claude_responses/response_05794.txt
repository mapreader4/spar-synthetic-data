Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Todd borrowed $100 from his brother to start the snow-cone stand.
2. He has to repay his brother $110.
3. Todd spent $75 on ingredients for the snow cones.
4. He sold 200 snow cones for $0.75 each.
   * Revenue from selling 200 snow cones = 200 x $0.75 = $150
5. After paying back his brother $110, the remaining money Todd has is:
   * Revenue from selling snow cones ($150) - Amount borrowed ($100) - Cost of ingredients ($75) = $150 - $100 - $75 = -$25

Therefore, after paying back his brother, Todd does not have any money left. He actually has a loss of $25.

Answer: -$25
