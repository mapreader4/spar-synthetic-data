Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Sandy bought 1 million Safe Moon tokens.
2. She wants to keep half of them for herself.
   * 1 million tokens / 2 = 500,000 tokens that she will keep for herself.
3. The remaining 500,000 tokens will be divided among her 4 siblings.
   * 500,000 tokens / 4 siblings = 125,000 tokens per sibling.
4. Sandy will have 500,000 tokens for herself, while each of her siblings will have 125,000 tokens.
5. The difference between Sandy's tokens and each of her siblings' tokens is:
   * 500,000 tokens - 125,000 tokens = 375,000 tokens.

Answer: 375,000
