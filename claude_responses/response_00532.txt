Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The batting cage sells golf balls by the dozen
* They charge $30 for 3 dozen
* Dan buys 5 dozen
* Gus buys 2 dozen
* Chris buys 48 golf balls
* Assuming 12 golf balls are 1 dozen

First, let's calculate how many golf balls Dan and Gus bought:
* Dan bought 5 dozen, which is 5 x 12 = 60 golf balls
* Gus bought 2 dozen, which is 2 x 12 = 24 golf balls

Now, let's add up the total number of golf balls purchased:
* Dan: 60 golf balls
* Gus: 24 golf balls
* Chris: 48 golf balls
* Total: 60 + 24 + 48 = 132 golf balls

Answer: 132
