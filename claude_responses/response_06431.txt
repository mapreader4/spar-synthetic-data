Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The computer's cost is $700.
2) The accessories cost is $200.
3) The PlayStation was worth $400.
4) John sold the PlayStation for 20% less than its value. 
   * 20% of $400 is $80.
   * So, the PlayStation was sold for $400 - $80 = $320.
5) To calculate how much money came out of John's pocket, we need to find the difference between the total cost of the computer and accessories, and the amount he received from selling the PlayStation.
   * Total cost of computer and accessories: $700 + $200 = $900.
   * Amount received from selling the PlayStation: $320.
   * Difference: $900 - $320 = $580.

Answer: $580
