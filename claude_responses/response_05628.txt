Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Desmond bought three times as many toys for his younger son as he bought for his elder son.
2) The elder son received 60 toys.
3) Since the younger son received three times as many toys as the elder son, the number of toys the younger son received is 3 x 60 = 180 toys.
4) The total number of toys Mr. Desmond bought is the sum of the toys for the elder son (60) and the toys for the younger son (180).
5) The total number of toys Mr. Desmond bought is 60 + 180 = 240 toys.

Answer: 240
