Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Henry has 3 more country CDs than rock CDs.
2) He has twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs.
3) He has 23 country CDs.

Let's start by finding the number of rock CDs:
* If Henry has 3 more country CDs than rock CDs, and he has 23 country CDs, then the number of rock CDs must be 23 - 3 = 20.

Now, we know that he has twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs. So:
* Number of classical CDs = 20 / 2 = 10.

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 10
