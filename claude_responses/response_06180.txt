Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The artist uses 3 ounces of paint for each large canvas they cover.
2) They have completed 3 large paintings.
3) So for the large paintings, they have used 3 ounces x 3 paintings = 9 ounces of paint.
4) The artist uses 2 ounces of paint for each small canvas they cover.
5) They have completed 4 small paintings.
6) So for the small paintings, they have used 2 ounces x 4 paintings = 8 ounces of paint.
7) To find the total amount of paint used, we add the amounts for the large and small paintings:
9 ounces + 8 ounces = 17 ounces.
