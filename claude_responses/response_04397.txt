Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Max can trade 3 coconuts for 1 crab.
2) Max can trade 6 crabs for 1 goat.
3) Max has 342 coconuts.
4) To convert all 342 coconuts into goats, we need to first convert the coconuts into crabs, and then convert the crabs into goats.
5) To convert 342 coconuts into crabs, we divide 342 by 3, since 3 coconuts = 1 crab.
6) 342 / 3 = 114 crabs.
7) To convert 114 crabs into goats, we divide 114 by 6, since 6 crabs = 1 goat.
8) 114 / 6 = 19 goats.

Answer: 19 goats.
