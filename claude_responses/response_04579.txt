Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The window is made up of 8 glass panes.
2) Each pane has a length of 12 inches and a width of 8 inches.
3) To find the area of each pane, we multiply the length and width:
   Area of each pane = 12 inches x 8 inches = 96 square inches
4) To find the total area of the window, we multiply the area of each pane by the number of panes:
   Total area of the window = 96 square inches x 8 panes = 768 square inches.

Answer: 768
