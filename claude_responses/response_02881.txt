Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, there were 50 fish in the pond.
2) There were 3 times as many tadpoles as fish, so the initial number of tadpoles was 3 * 50 = 150.
3) Curtis caught 7 fish, so the remaining number of fish is 50 - 7 = 43.
4) Half the tadpoles developed into frogs, so the remaining number of tadpoles is 150 / 2 = 75.
5) The difference between the number of tadpoles and the number of fish is 75 - 43 = 32.

Answer: 32
