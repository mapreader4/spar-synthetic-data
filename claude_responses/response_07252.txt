Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In North Carolina, Jim bought 10 gallons of gas at $2.00 per gallon.
   * The total cost for the gas in North Carolina is:
     * 10 gallons x $2.00/gallon = $20.00

2. In Virginia, Jim bought another 10 gallons of gas, but at $1.00 more per gallon than in North Carolina.
   * The price per gallon in Virginia is $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00 per gallon.
   * The total cost for the gas in Virginia is:
     * 10 gallons x $3.00/gallon = $30.00

3. To calculate the total amount Jim has spent on gas, we add the costs from North Carolina and Virginia:
   * $20.00 + $30.00 = $50.00

Answer: $50
