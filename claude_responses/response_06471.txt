Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jemma saw 7 grasshoppers on her African daisy plant
* She then found 2 dozen baby grasshoppers hopping on the grass under the plant
* 2 dozen means 2 x 12 = 24 baby grasshoppers

To find the total number of grasshoppers Jemma found, we add the 7 grasshoppers on the plant and the 24 baby grasshoppers on the grass:
7 + 24 = 31

Answer: 31
