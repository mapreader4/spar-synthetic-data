Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Claire has 4 hours to clean
* She has 2 hours to cook
* The remaining time in her working day is the total day minus the time spent cleaning and cooking, and minus the 8 hours of sleep
* Total day = 24 hours
* Time spent cleaning = 4 hours
* Time spent cooking = 2 hours
* Time spent sleeping = 8 hours
* Remaining time in working day = 24 - 4 - 2 - 8 = 10 hours
* This remaining 10 hours is divided equally between crafting and tailoring
* So, the time spent crafting = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

Answer: 5 hours
