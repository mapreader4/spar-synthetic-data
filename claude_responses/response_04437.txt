Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Last year, the race was 300 meters long.
2) This year, the race will be 4 times as long, so the new race length is 4 * 300 = 1200 meters.
3) There will be 6 tables set up for the relay run.
4) The distance between the tables must be the same, and the last table will be at the finish line.
5) To find the distance between table 1 and table 3, we need to divide the total race distance by the number of spaces between the tables.
6) The number of spaces between the tables is one less than the number of tables, so 6 - 1 = 5 spaces.
7) Therefore, the distance between each table is 1200 meters / 5 spaces = 240 meters.
8) The distance between table 1 and table 3 is 2 * 240 meters = 480 meters.

Answer: 480 meters
