Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are three jars of candy: peanut butter, grape, and banana.
2) The jar of peanut butter candy has 4 times as much candy as the jar of grape candy.
3) The jar of grape candy has 5 more pieces of candy than the jar of banana candy.
4) The jar of banana candy has 43 pieces of candy.
5) Since the jar of grape candy has 5 more pieces of candy than the jar of banana candy, the jar of grape candy has 43 + 5 = 48 pieces of candy.
6) Since the jar of peanut butter candy has 4 times as much candy as the jar of grape candy, and the jar of grape candy has 48 pieces of candy, the jar of peanut butter candy has 4 * 48 = 192 pieces of candy.
