Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nate ran a distance equal to four times the length of a football field in 8 seconds.
2) The length of a football field is 168 meters.
3) Therefore, the distance Nate ran in 8 seconds is 4 * 168 = 672 meters.
4) Nate then rested and ran 500 more meters.
5) The total distance Nate ran is the distance in step 3 (672 meters) plus the additional 500 meters.
6) Therefore, the total distance Nate ran is 672 + 500 = 1172 meters.

Answer: 1172
