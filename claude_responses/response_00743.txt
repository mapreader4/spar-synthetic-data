Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The empty plane needs 20 gallons of fuel per mile
* Each person on the plane increases the fuel needed by 3 gallons per mile
* There are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, so 35 people total
* Each person brought two bags, so there are 70 bags total
* Each bag increases the fuel needed by 2 gallons per mile
* The total distance of the trip is 400 miles

First, let's calculate the fuel needed for the empty plane:
* 20 gallons per mile x 400 miles = 8,000 gallons

Next, let's calculate the additional fuel needed for the passengers and crew:
* 35 people x 3 gallons per mile x 400 miles = 42,000 gallons

Finally, let's calculate the additional fuel needed for the bags:
* 70 bags x 2 gallons per mile x 400 miles = 56,000 gallons

Now we can add up the total fuel needed:
* 8,000 gallons + 42,000 gallons + 56,000 gallons = 106,000 gallons

Answer: 106,000 gallons
