Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Last week, Keiko sent 111 text messages.
2) This week, she sent 50 less than double what she sent last week.
   - Last week, she sent 111 messages.
   - Double of 111 is 222.
   - 50 less than 222 is 172.
3) To find the total number of text messages Keiko sent last week and this week combined, we add the two amounts:
   - Last week: 111 messages
   - This week: 172 messages
   - Total: 111 + 172 = 283 messages

Answer: 283
