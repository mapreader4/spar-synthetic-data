Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 people in total (John and his 5 friends)
* They ordered 3 pizzas
* Each pizza has 8 slices
* They all finished and ate the same amount of pizza

First, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices:
* 3 pizzas x 8 slices per pizza = 24 total slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find how many slices each person ate:
* 24 total slices / 6 people = 4 slices per person
