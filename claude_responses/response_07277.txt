Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Jeff bought 6 pairs of shoes and 4 jerseys
* The total cost of the 6 pairs of shoes and 4 jerseys is $560
* The jerseys cost 1/4 the price of one pair of shoes
* Let's call the price of one pair of shoes 'x'
* Then, the price of one jersey is 1/4 of x, which is x/4
* The total cost of the 6 pairs of shoes is 6x
* The total cost of the 4 jerseys is 4(x/4) = x
* The total cost is 6x + x = 7x
* We know the total cost is $560, so:
* 7x = $560
* x = $80
* Therefore, the total price of the shoes is 6 * $80 = $480

Answer: $480
