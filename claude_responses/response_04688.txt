Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Emily bought a shirt and a coat for a total of $600
* The shirt is one-third the price of the coat
* Let's call the price of the coat 'x'
* Then the price of the shirt is 'x/3'
* The total cost of the shirt and coat is $600
* So we can write the equation: x + x/3 = 600
* Solving for x, we get:
* 4x/3 = 600
* x = 450
* Therefore, the price of the coat is $450
* And the price of the shirt is $450/3 = $150

Answer: 150
