Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Toby's father gave him $343 for passing the test.
2) Toby decided to share it with his two brothers, so he gave each of them 1/7 of $343.
3) To find how much Toby gave to each brother, we need to calculate 1/7 of $343:
   * 1/7 of $343 = $343 / 7 = $49
4) Toby gave $49 to each of his two brothers, so the total amount he gave to his brothers is:
   * $49 x 2 = $98
5) To find how much money Toby has left, we need to subtract the amount he gave to his brothers from the original $343:
   * $343 - $98 = $245

Answer: $245
