Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal
* It takes him 3 times that long to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.

First, let's calculate how long Tate spent in high school:
* Normal high school duration = 4 years
* Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal, so his high school duration = 4 - 1 = 3 years

Now, let's calculate how long it took him to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.:
* It takes him 3 times the duration of high school to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.
* Duration of high school = 3 years
* Duration of bachelor's degree and Ph.D. = 3 x 3 = 9 years

Therefore, the total number of years Tate spent in high school and college is:
* High school: 3 years
* Bachelor's degree and Ph.D.: 9 years
* Total: 3 + 9 = 12 years

Answer: 12 years
