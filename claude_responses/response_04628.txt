Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Greta's brother received 40 letters.
2) Greta received 10 more letters than her brother, so Greta received 40 + 10 = 50 letters.
3) The total number of letters Greta and her brother received is 50 + 40 = 90 letters.
4) Greta's mother received twice the total number of letters Greta and her brother received, so Greta's mother received 2 * 90 = 180 letters.
5) The total number of letters the three received is 50 + 40 + 180 = 270 letters.

Answer: 270
