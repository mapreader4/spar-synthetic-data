Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Annie was given a pack of 21 crayons.
2) She already had a box of 36 crayons in her locker.
3) Her friend Bobby gave her half the amount she already had in her locker, which is 36 / 2 = 18 crayons.
4) So now Annie has a total of 21 + 36 + 18 = 75 crayons.
5) She decided to give her sister Mary 1/3 of her total amount of crayons.
6) 1/3 of 75 crayons is 75 / 3 = 25 crayons.

Answer: 25 crayons.
