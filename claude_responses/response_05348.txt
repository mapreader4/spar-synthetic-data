Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that there are 12 inches to a foot.
2) Blossom's room is 10 feet long in each direction.
3) To find the area of the room in square inches, we need to convert the room's dimensions from feet to inches.
4) 10 feet x 12 inches/foot = 120 inches in each direction.
5) The area of the room is the length times the width, which is 120 inches x 120 inches = 14,400 square inches.

Answer: 14,400
