Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Adelaide bought 30 ducks
* Adelaide bought twice the number of ducks that Ephraim bought
* So, if Adelaide bought 30 ducks, and she bought twice the number of ducks that Ephraim bought, then Ephraim bought 15 ducks (30 / 2 = 15)
* Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton
* So, if Ephraim bought 15 ducks, and he bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, then Kolton bought 60 ducks (15 + 45 = 60)

Now, to find the average number of ducks the three bought, we add up the number of ducks each bought and divide by 3:
* Adelaide bought 30 ducks
* Ephraim bought 15 ducks
* Kolton bought 60 ducks
* Total number of ducks bought = 30 + 15 + 60 = 105
* Average number of ducks bought = 105 / 3 = 35

Answer: 35
