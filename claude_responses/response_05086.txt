Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Regular ticket price: $10
2. Regular popcorn & drink combo price: $10
3. From 12 noon to 3 pm, there is a special offer:
   - 20% off tickets
   - 50% off food combos

To calculate the savings:

Ticket price with 20% discount:
* $10 - (20% of $10) = $10 - $2 = $8

Popcorn & drink combo price with 50% discount:
* $10 - (50% of $10) = $10 - $5 = $5

Total cost during the special offer:
* $8 (ticket) + $5 (popcorn & drink combo) = $13

Total cost during regular hours:
* $10 (ticket) + $10 (popcorn & drink combo) = $20

The savings would be:
* $20 (regular cost) - $13 (special offer cost) = $7

Answer: $7
