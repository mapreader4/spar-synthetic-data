Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A single spider has 8 legs
* The group of spiders has 10 more spiders than half as many legs as a single spider has
* To find the number of spiders in the group, we first need to find half the number of legs a single spider has:
    - 8 legs / 2 = 4 legs
* Now, the group has 10 more spiders than that, so:
    - 4 spiders + 10 = 14 spiders
* To find the total number of spider legs in the group, we multiply the number of spiders (14) by the number of legs per spider (8):
    - 14 spiders x 8 legs/spider = 112 legs

Answer: 112
