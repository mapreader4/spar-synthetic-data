Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sue initially borrowed 15 books and 6 movies.
2) She returned 8 books, so she now has 15 - 8 = 7 books.
3) She returned a third of the 6 movies, which is 6 / 3 = 2 movies. So she now has 6 - 2 = 4 movies.
4) She then checked out 9 more books, so she now has 7 + 9 = 16 books.
5) In total, Sue now has 16 books and 4 movies.

Answer: 16 books, 4 movies.
