Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carl earns $0.50 every time he buys a candy bar
* His neighbor pays him $0.75 every week for taking out the trash
* We want to know how many candy bars Carl can buy after 4 weeks

First, let's calculate how much money Carl earns in 4 weeks:
* $0.75 per week x 4 weeks = $3.00 total

Now, let's calculate how many candy bars Carl can buy with $3.00:
* $3.00 / $0.50 per candy bar = 6 candy bars

Answer: 6 candy bars
