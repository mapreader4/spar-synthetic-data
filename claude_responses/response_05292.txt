Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rachelle threw 180 pennies into the fountain
* Gretchen threw half as many pennies as Rachelle
* To find how many pennies Gretchen threw, we take Rachelle's 180 pennies and divide by 2:
* 180 / 2 = 90 pennies
* Rocky threw one-third as many pennies as Gretchen
* To find how many pennies Rocky threw, we take Gretchen's 90 pennies and divide by 3:
* 90 / 3 = 30 pennies
* To find the total number of pennies thrown into the fountain, we add up the pennies thrown by each person:
* Rachelle: 180 pennies
* Gretchen: 90 pennies
* Rocky: 30 pennies
* Total: 180 + 90 + 30 = 300 pennies

Answer: 300
