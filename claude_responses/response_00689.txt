Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that the Uber ride costs $22.
2) We also know that the Uber ride costs $3 more than the Lyft ride.
   * So, the Lyft ride costs $22 - $3 = $19.
3) We know that the Lyft ride costs $4 more than the taxi ride.
   * So, the taxi ride costs $19 - $4 = $15.
4) The taxi driver is tipped 20% of the original cost of the ride.
   * The original cost of the ride is $15.
   * 20% of $15 is $3.
   * So, the total cost of the taxi ride, including the tip, is $15 + $3 = $18.
