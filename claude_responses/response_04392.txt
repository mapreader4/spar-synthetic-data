Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The town has 10 neighborhoods
* Each neighborhood has 4 roads passing through it
* Each road has 250 street lights on each opposite side

To calculate the total number of street lights, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of street lights on each road
2. Multiply that by the total number of roads in the town
3. Multiply that by the total number of neighborhoods in the town

Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights on each road
* Each road has 250 street lights on each opposite side
* So the total number of street lights on each road is 250 + 250 = 500

Step 2: Calculate the total number of roads in the town
* Each neighborhood has 4 roads
* There are 10 neighborhoods
* So the total number of roads is 10 x 4 = 40

Step 3: Calculate the total number of street lights in the town
* Each road has 500 street lights
* There are 40 roads in total
* So the total number of street lights is 500 x 40 = 20,000

Answer: 20,000
