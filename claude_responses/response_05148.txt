Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Monica has 6 classes per day
* The first class has 20 students
* The second and third classes have 25 students each
* The fourth class has half as many students as the first class, which is 20 / 2 = 10 students
* The fifth and sixth classes have 28 students each

Now, let's add up the total number of students Monica sees each day:
* First class: 20 students
* Second class: 25 students
* Third class: 25 students
* Fourth class: 10 students
* Fifth class: 28 students
* Sixth class: 28 students

Adding these up, we get:
20 + 25 + 25 + 10 + 28 + 28 = 136 students

Answer: 136
