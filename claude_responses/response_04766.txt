Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bag of sugar held 24 ounces before it was dropped.
* The ants remove 4 ounces of sugar every hour.
* After 3 hours, we need to find how many more hours the ants will need to harvest the remaining sugar.

First, let's calculate how much sugar the ants have removed after 3 hours:
* 4 ounces per hour x 3 hours = 12 ounces of sugar removed

Now, we can calculate the remaining sugar:
* 24 ounces - 12 ounces = 12 ounces of sugar remaining

Finally, we can calculate how many more hours the ants will need to harvest the remaining sugar:
* 12 ounces remaining / 4 ounces per hour = 3 hours

Therefore, the ants will need 3 more hours to harvest the remaining sugar.
