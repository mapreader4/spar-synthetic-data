Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The tailor purchased 90 green buttons.
2) She bought 10 more yellow buttons than the green buttons. So, the number of yellow buttons is 90 + 10 = 100.
3) She bought 5 fewer blue buttons than the green buttons. So, the number of blue buttons is 90 - 5 = 85.
4) To find the total number of buttons purchased, we add the number of green, yellow, and blue buttons:
90 + 100 + 85 = 275

Answer: 275
