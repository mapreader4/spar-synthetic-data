Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bert made 12 sandwiches for his trip.
2) On the first day, he ate half of the sandwiches he made, which is 12 / 2 = 6 sandwiches.
3) That means he had 12 - 6 = 6 sandwiches left after the first day.
4) On the second day, he ate 2 sandwiches less than the first day, which is 6 - 2 = 4 sandwiches.
5) Therefore, the number of sandwiches Bert has left after these two days is 6 - 4 = 2 sandwiches.
