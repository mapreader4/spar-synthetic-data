Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Flynn watches 30 minutes of TV every night during the weekdays
* There are 5 weekdays in a week
* So, in a week, Flynn watches 30 minutes x 5 days = 150 minutes of TV during the weekdays
* On the weekends, she watches an additional 2 hours of TV in total
* 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes
* So, in a week, Flynn watches a total of 150 minutes + 120 minutes = 270 minutes of TV
* There are 52 weeks in a year
* To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
* 270 minutes x 52 weeks = 14,040 minutes
* 14,040 minutes / 60 = 234 hours

Answer: 234 hours
