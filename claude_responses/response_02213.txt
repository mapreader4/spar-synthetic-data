Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nancy agreed to pay 40% of the cost of her daughter's car insurance
* The car insurance costs $80 per month
* To find the amount Nancy will pay each year, we need to:
1. Calculate the monthly amount Nancy pays:
   * 40% of $80 = 0.4 x $80 = $32 per month
2. Calculate the yearly amount Nancy pays:
   * $32 per month x 12 months = $384 per year

Answer: $384
