Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ernie's income used to be $6000.
2) Ernie's income is now 4/5 of what it used to be. 
   * To calculate Ernie's current income, we take 4/5 of $6000:
   * 4/5 * $6000 = $4800
3) Jack's income is now twice what Ernie used to make.
   * Ernie used to make $6000, so Jack's income is now 2 * $6000 = $12000.
4) To find the combined income of Ernie and Jack, we add their individual incomes:
   * Ernie's income: $4800
   * Jack's income: $12000
   * Combined income: $4800 + $12000 = $16800

Answer: $16800
