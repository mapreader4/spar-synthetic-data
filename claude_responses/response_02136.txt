Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jessica needs to complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver's license
* It takes 20 minutes to drive to school
* She drives to and from school every day

To calculate the number of school days it will take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement, we need to find out how many minutes of driving she can complete each day.

* Driving to school: 20 minutes
* Driving from school: 20 minutes
* Total driving time per day: 20 + 20 = 40 minutes

Now, we need to convert the 50-hour requirement to minutes:
* 50 hours = 50 x 60 minutes = 3,000 minutes

Finally, we can divide the total driving time required (3,000 minutes) by the daily driving time (40 minutes) to get the number of school days:
* 3,000 minutes / 40 minutes per day = 75 school days

Answer: 75
