Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The school bought 10 cases of bottled water
* Each case contains 20 bottles
* So the total number of bottles bought is 10 cases x 20 bottles per case = 200 bottles
* After the first game, 70 bottles were used
* So the remaining number of bottles after the first game is 200 - 70 = 130 bottles
* After the second game, only 20 bottles were left
* Therefore, the number of bottles used during the second game is 130 - 20 = 110 bottles

Answer: 110 bottles
