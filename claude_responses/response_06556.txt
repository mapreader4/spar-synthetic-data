Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Danielle has $10 to spend on supplies.
2) She buys one set of molds for $3 and a pack of 100 popsicle sticks for $1.
3) This leaves her with $6 to spend on juice.
4) Each bottle of juice makes 20 popsicles and costs $2.
5) With $6, she can buy 3 bottles of juice (3 x $2 = $6).
6) Each bottle of juice makes 20 popsicles, so with 3 bottles she can make 3 x 20 = 60 popsicles.
7) She bought 100 popsicle sticks, and she used 60 of them to make the popsicles.
8) Therefore, she will be left with 100 - 60 = 40 popsicle sticks.

Answer: 40
