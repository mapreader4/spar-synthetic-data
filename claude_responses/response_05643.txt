Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aron spends 30 minutes/day vacuuming 3 times a week
* So for vacuuming, he spends 30 minutes x 3 days = 90 minutes per week
* Aron spends 20 minutes/day dusting 2 days a week
* So for dusting, he spends 20 minutes x 2 days = 40 minutes per week
* To find the total time spent cleaning each week, we add the time spent vacuuming and dusting:
* 90 minutes + 40 minutes = 130 minutes per week

Answer: 130 minutes
