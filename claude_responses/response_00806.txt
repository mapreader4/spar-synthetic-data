Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The original price of the porcelain vase is $200.
2) The vase went on sale for 25% off. To calculate the discounted price, we take the original price and subtract 25%:
$200 - (25% of $200) = $200 - $50 = $150
3) Donna then has to pay 10% sales tax on the discounted price of $150.
4) To calculate the sales tax, we take 10% of $150:
10% of $150 = 0.10 * $150 = $15
5) The total amount Donna paid is the discounted price plus the sales tax:
$150 + $15 = $165
Answer: $165
