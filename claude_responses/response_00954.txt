Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pam has 10 bags of apples
2) Each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags
3) Gerald's bags have 40 apples each
4) So each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 x 40 = 120 apples
5) Since Pam has 10 bags, and each bag has 120 apples, the total number of apples Pam has is:
10 bags x 120 apples per bag = 1,200 apples

Answer: 1,200
