Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* There are 20 bicycles in the garage
* Each bicycle has 2 wheels
* So the total number of wheels for the bicycles is 20 * 2 = 40 wheels
* There are 10 cars in the garage
* Each car has 4 wheels
* So the total number of wheels for the cars is 10 * 4 = 40 wheels
* There are 5 motorcycles in the garage
* Each motorcycle has 2 wheels
* So the total number of wheels for the motorcycles is 5 * 2 = 10 wheels
* To find the total number of wheels in the garage, we add up the wheels for the bicycles, cars, and motorcycles:
* 40 + 40 + 10 = 90 wheels

Answer: 90
