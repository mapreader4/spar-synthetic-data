Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We are given that Bailey has a 100cm length of rope.
2) The longer sides of the rectangle are 28cm long.
3) Since the rectangle has four sides, the total length of the longer sides is 2 * 28cm = 56cm.
4) The remaining length of rope must be used for the shorter sides.
5) The remaining length of rope is 100cm - 56cm = 44cm.
6) Since the rectangle has four sides, the total length of the shorter sides is 44cm.
7) To find the length of each shorter side, we divide the total length of the shorter sides by 2.
8) 44cm / 2 = 22cm.

Answer: 22
