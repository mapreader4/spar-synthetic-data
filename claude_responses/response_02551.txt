Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Duke needs 17 more points to tie the old record of 257 points
* By the end of the game, Duke breaks the record by 5 points
* So the new record is 257 + 17 + 5 = 279 points
* In the final game, Duke made:
  - 5 free throws (worth 1 point each) = 5 points
  - 4 regular baskets (worth 2 points each) = 8 points
  - Some number of three-pointers
* Normally, Duke scores 2 three-pointers per game
* To find the number of additional three-pointers Duke scored in the final game, we need to:
  - Calculate the total points he scored in the final game
  - Subtract the points from the free throws and regular baskets
  - The remaining points must have come from the three-pointers

The total points Duke scored in the final game is 279 (the new record).
Subtracting the 5 points from the free throws and the 8 points from the regular baskets, we get:
279 - 5 - 8 = 266 points from three-pointers

Normally, Duke scores 2 three-pointers per game, which would be 6 points.
The remaining 266 - 6 = 260 points must have come from additional three-pointers.
Since each three-pointer is worth 3 points, the number of additional three-pointers Duke scored is:
260 / 3 = 86.67 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Answer: 87 more three-pointers
