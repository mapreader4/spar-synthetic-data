Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom is taking 10 dance lessons
* Each lesson costs $10
* He gets 2 of the lessons for free

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the 8 lessons he has to pay for:
   * 8 lessons x $10 per lesson = $80
2. Subtract the cost of the 2 free lessons:
   * $80 - (2 x $10) = $80 - $20 = $60

Therefore, the total amount Tom pays is:
Answer: $60
