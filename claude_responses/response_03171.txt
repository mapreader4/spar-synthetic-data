Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brian is taping up 5 boxes that measure 15 inches by 30 inches
* Each of these boxes needs 3 pieces of tape:
  - 1 piece as long as the long side (30 inches)
  - 2 pieces as long as the short side (15 inches)
* So for each of the 5 boxes, he needs:
  - 1 piece of 30 inches
  - 2 pieces of 15 inches
* That's a total of 3 pieces per box
* And he has 5 boxes, so the total for the 5 boxes is:
  - 5 boxes x 3 pieces per box = 15 pieces of tape
* Now, he also has 2 boxes that measure 40 inches square
* Each of these boxes needs 3 pieces of tape:
  - 1 piece as long as the long side (40 inches)
  - 2 pieces as long as the short side (40 inches)
* So for each of the 2 boxes, he needs:
  - 1 piece of 40 inches
  - 2 pieces of 40 inches
* That's a total of 3 pieces per box
* And he has 2 boxes, so the total for the 2 boxes is:
  - 2 boxes x 3 pieces per box = 6 pieces of tape
* Adding up the total pieces of tape for all the boxes:
  - 15 pieces + 6 pieces = 21 pieces of tape
