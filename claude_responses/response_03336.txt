Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bicycles have 2 wheels each
* Dimitri saw 6 adults riding bicycles
* So, the number of wheels on the bicycles is:
  * 6 bicycles x 2 wheels per bicycle = 12 wheels
* Tricycles have 3 wheels each
* Dimitri saw 15 children riding tricycles
* So, the number of wheels on the tricycles is:
  * 15 tricycles x 3 wheels per tricycle = 45 wheels
* To find the total number of wheels Dimitri saw, we add the wheels on the bicycles and the wheels on the tricycles:
  * 12 wheels + 45 wheels = 57 wheels

Answer: 57
