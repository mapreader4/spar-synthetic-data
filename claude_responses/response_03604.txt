Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In the first week, 40 pounds of food were donated.
2) In the second week, donations were twice as high as the first week. So, the amount of food donated in the second week was 2 * 40 = 80 pounds.
3) The total amount of food donated in the first two weeks is 40 + 80 = 120 pounds.
4) In the third week, Lyanna gave out 70% of the donated food to the homeless. 
5) To calculate the amount of food remaining, we take the total donated food (120 pounds) and subtract 70% of that amount:
120 pounds - (0.7 * 120 pounds) = 120 pounds - 84 pounds = 36 pounds.

Answer: 36 pounds.
