Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The book costs $4 more than a CD.
2) The CD is 30% cheaper than a $20 album.
3) To find the cost of the CD, we need to first find the discount on the album.
4) The discount on the album is 30%, so the CD costs 70% of $20, which is $14.
5) Since the book costs $4 more than the CD, and the CD costs $14, the book must cost $14 + $4 = $18.

Answer: $18
