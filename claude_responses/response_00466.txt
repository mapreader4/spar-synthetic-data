Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark is allotted 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year
* He uses half of his allotment of both types of days in a year
* Each day covers an 8-hour long workday

First, let's calculate how many days he has left:
* Sick days allotment: 10
* Sick days used: 10 / 2 = 5
* Sick days left: 10 - 5 = 5
* Vacation days allotment: 10
* Vacation days used: 10 / 2 = 5
* Vacation days left: 10 - 5 = 5
* Total days left: 5 sick days + 5 vacation days = 10 days

Now, let's calculate the total hours' worth of days he has left:
* Each day is 8 hours long
* 10 days x 8 hours/day = 80 hours

Answer: 80 hours
