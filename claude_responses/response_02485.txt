Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carly practices her butterfly stroke for 3 hours a day, 4 days a week
* So, for her butterfly stroke, she practices for 3 hours x 4 days = 12 hours per week
* Carly practices her backstroke for 2 hours a day, 6 days a week
* So, for her backstroke, she practices for 2 hours x 6 days = 12 hours per week
* In a month with 4 weeks, she practices:
* Butterfly stroke: 12 hours/week x 4 weeks = 48 hours
* Backstroke: 12 hours/week x 4 weeks = 48 hours
* Total time spent practicing swimming in a month with 4 weeks:
* 48 hours (butterfly stroke) + 48 hours (backstroke) = 96 hours

Answer: 96 hours
