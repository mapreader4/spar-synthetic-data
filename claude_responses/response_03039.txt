Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The company has 3 units of machinery that require a running current of 40A each.
2) The machinery requires at least twice their running current for starting.
3) The transformer must be able to handle the maximum current load.
4) To calculate the maximum current load, we need to find the total running current and the total starting current.
5) The total running current is 3 * 40A = 120A.
6) The total starting current is 3 * (2 * 40A) = 3 * 80A = 240A.
7) The transformer must be able to carry the maximum current load, which is the total starting current of 240A.

Answer: 240
