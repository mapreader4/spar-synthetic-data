Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nadia walked 18 kilometers
* Nadia's distance was twice as far as Hannah's distance
* So, if Nadia walked 18 kilometers, and that was twice as far as Hannah, then Hannah must have walked half of 18 kilometers
* Half of 18 kilometers is 9 kilometers
* So, Hannah walked 9 kilometers
* To find the total distance walked by the two girls, we add Nadia's distance and Hannah's distance:
* Nadia's distance: 18 kilometers
* Hannah's distance: 9 kilometers
* Total distance: 18 kilometers + 9 kilometers = 27 kilometers

Answer: 27 kilometers
