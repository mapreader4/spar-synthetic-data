Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bethany saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits
* She saw 80 paintings total

Let's represent the number of portraits as x.
Then, the number of still lifes would be 4x.

The total number of paintings is 80, so we can write the equation:
x + 4x = 80

Solving for x:
5x = 80
x = 80/5
x = 16

Therefore, Bethany saw 16 portraits.

Answer: 16
