Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Patricia has $6
* Lisa has five times Patricia's money, which is 5 * $6 = $30
* Lisa also has double Charlotte's money, so Charlotte has half of Lisa's money, which is $30 / 2 = $15
* The total amount of money they have is $6 + $30 + $15 = $51
* The rare baseball card costs $100
* To find how much more money they require, we subtract the amount they have ($51) from the cost of the card ($100)
* $100 - $51 = $49

Answer: $49
