Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Melody needs to read 20 pages for her English class
* Melody needs to read 16 pages for her Science class
* Melody needs to read 8 pages for her Civics class
* Melody needs to read 12 pages for her Chinese class
* Melody decided to read one-fourth of the number of pages for each class tomorrow

To calculate the number of pages she will read tomorrow, we need to find one-fourth of the total number of pages across all her classes.

Total pages:
* English: 20 pages
* Science: 16 pages
* Civics: 8 pages
* Chinese: 12 pages
* Total = 20 + 16 + 8 + 12 = 56 pages

One-fourth of the total pages:
* 56 pages / 4 = 14 pages

Answer: 14
