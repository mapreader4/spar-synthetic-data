Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marcy uses 6 ounces of pet cleaner to clean up a dog stain
* She needs to clean up after 6 dogs
* So for the 6 dogs, she will need 6 x 6 = 36 ounces of pet cleaner

* Marcy uses 4 ounces of pet cleaner to clean up a cat stain
* She needs to clean up after 3 cats
* So for the 3 cats, she will need 3 x 4 = 12 ounces of pet cleaner

* Marcy uses 1 ounce of pet cleaner to clean up a rabbit stain
* She needs to clean up after 1 rabbit
* So for the 1 rabbit, she will need 1 x 1 = 1 ounce of pet cleaner

* To calculate the total amount of pet cleaner needed, we add up the amounts for the dogs, cats, and rabbit:
* 36 ounces + 12 ounces + 1 ounce = 49 ounces

Answer: 49
