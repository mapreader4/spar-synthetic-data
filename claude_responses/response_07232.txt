Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Emma initially had $230 in her bank account.
2) She withdrew $60 to buy a new pair of shoes.
3) This means she now has $230 - $60 = $170 in her bank account.
4) The next week, she deposited twice as much money as she withdrew, which is 2 * $60 = $120.
5) So, the total amount in her bank account now is $170 + $120 = $290.

Answer: 290
