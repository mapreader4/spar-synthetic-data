Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall ordered a total of 100 chicken nuggets
* Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa
* Let's represent the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate as x
* Since Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, they each ate 2x chicken nuggets
* The total number of chicken nuggets eaten is the sum of what Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall ate
* So the total is x + 2x + 2x = 5x
* We know the total number of chicken nuggets ordered was 100
* Therefore, 5x = 100
* Solving for x, we get x = 20
* Therefore, Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.

Answer: 20
