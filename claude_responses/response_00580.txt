Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The igloo has a total of 10 rows of bricks of snow
* The bottom half of the igloo has 12 bricks of snow in each row
* The top half of the igloo has 8 bricks of snow in each row
* To find the total number of bricks of snow used, we need to calculate the number of bricks in the bottom half and the top half, then add them together.

For the bottom half:
* There are 5 rows of 12 bricks each
* 5 rows x 12 bricks per row = 60 bricks

For the top half:
* There are 5 rows of 8 bricks each
* 5 rows x 8 bricks per row = 40 bricks

Now we add the bottom and top halves together:
* 60 bricks + 40 bricks = 100 bricks

Answer: 100
