Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Mary wants to bake 10 apple pies for a charity event.
2) Each pie needs 8 apples.
3) So the total number of apples needed for 10 pies is 10 * 8 = 80 apples.
4) Mary has already harvested 50 apples from the trees in her garden.
5) To calculate the number of additional apples she needs to buy, we subtract the number of apples she already has (50) from the total number of apples needed (80).
6) 80 - 50 = 30 apples.

Answer: 30
