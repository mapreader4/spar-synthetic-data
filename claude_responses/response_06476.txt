Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Geoff bought 2 pairs of sneakers and spent $60 equally between the two. This means each pair of sneakers cost $30.

2. On Tuesday, Geoff will spend 4 times as much on sneakers than he did on Monday. Since each pair of sneakers cost $30 on Monday, he will spend 4 x $30 = $120 on Tuesday.

3. On Wednesday, Geoff will spend 5 times as much on sneakers than he did on Monday. Since each pair of sneakers cost $30 on Monday, he will spend 5 x $30 = $150 on Wednesday.

Now, we can add up the total amount Geoff will spend on sneakers over the three days:
Monday: $60
Tuesday: $120
Wednesday: $150
Total: $60 + $120 + $150 = $330

Answer: 330
