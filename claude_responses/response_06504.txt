Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Bob bought 2 show dogs for $250.00 each, so the total cost of the dogs is:
   2 dogs x $250.00 per dog = $500.00
2. Bob just had a litter of 6 puppies from the female dog.
3. He plans to sell each puppy for $350.00.
4. The total revenue from selling the 6 puppies is:
   6 puppies x $350.00 per puppy = $2,100.00
5. To calculate the total profit, we need to subtract the cost of the dogs from the total revenue:
   $2,100.00 (total revenue) - $500.00 (cost of dogs) = $1,600.00 (total profit)

Answer: $1,600
