Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lara carries the backpack through the obstacle course in 7 minutes and 23 seconds.
   * 7 minutes = 420 seconds
   * 23 seconds
   * Total time for this step = 420 + 23 = 443 seconds

2. Lara then needs to crank open the door to the obstacle course, which takes 73 seconds.

3. Lara then traverses the obstacle course again without the backpack in 5 minutes and 58 seconds.
   * 5 minutes = 300 seconds
   * 58 seconds
   * Total time for this step = 300 + 58 = 358 seconds

To calculate the total time, we add up the times for each step:
* 443 seconds + 73 seconds + 358 seconds = 874 seconds

Answer: 874 seconds
