Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pat's stick is 30 inches long, and 7 inches of it is covered in dirt.
2) The portion of Pat's stick that is not covered in dirt is 30 inches - 7 inches = 23 inches.
3) The portion of Pat's stick that is not covered in dirt is half as long as Sarah's stick.
4) So, if the portion of Pat's stick that is not covered in dirt is 23 inches, and that is half as long as Sarah's stick, then Sarah's stick must be 2 * 23 inches = 46 inches long.
5) Jane's stick is two feet shorter than Sarah's stick.
6) One foot is 12 inches, so two feet is 24 inches.
7) Therefore, Jane's stick is 46 inches - 24 inches = 22 inches long.

Answer: 22 inches
