Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emma is currently 7 years old
* Her sister is 9 years older than her, so her sister's current age is 7 + 9 = 16 years old
* The question asks how old Emma will be when her sister is 56 years old
* To find this, we need to calculate how many years it will take for her sister to reach 56 years old
* Her sister's current age is 16, so it will take 56 - 16 = 40 years for her sister to reach 56
* Since Emma is 7 years old now, and 40 years will pass, Emma will be 7 + 40 = 47 years old when her sister is 56

Answer: 47
