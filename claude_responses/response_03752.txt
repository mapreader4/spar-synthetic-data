Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Lucca has 100 balls, and 10% of them are basketballs.
   * 10% of 100 = 0.1 * 100 = 10 basketballs

2) Lucien has 200 balls, and 20% of them are basketballs.
   * 20% of 200 = 0.2 * 200 = 40 basketballs

3) To find the total number of basketballs that Lucca and Lucien have, we add the number of basketballs each of them has:
   * 10 basketballs (Lucca) + 40 basketballs (Lucien) = 50 basketballs

Answer: 50
