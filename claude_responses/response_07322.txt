Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wynter saw 50 bicycles at the bike shop
* Each bicycle has 2 wheels
* So, the total number of wheels for the bicycles is:
  * 50 bicycles x 2 wheels per bicycle = 100 wheels
* Wynter also saw 20 tricycles at the bike shop
* Each tricycle has 3 wheels
* So, the total number of wheels for the tricycles is:
  * 20 tricycles x 3 wheels per tricycle = 60 wheels
* To find the total number of wheels, we add the wheels for the bicycles and the tricycles:
  * 100 wheels + 60 wheels = 160 wheels

Answer: 160
