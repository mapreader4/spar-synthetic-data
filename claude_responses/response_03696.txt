Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Christina walks 7km to school every day from Monday to Friday
* She then returns home, covering the same 7km distance
* So, each day she covers a total of 7km + 7km = 14km
* She does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days
* So, for the 5 days from Monday to Friday, she covers a total of 14km x 5 = 70km
* On Friday, her mother asked her to pass by her friend, which is another 2km away from the school in the opposite direction from home
* So, on Friday, she covered an additional 2km + 2km = 4km
* Therefore, the total distance Christina covered that week is 70km + 4km = 74km

Answer: 74
