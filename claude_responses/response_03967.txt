Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Jordan gave Danielle two dozen roses and a box of chocolates as a birthday gift.
2) Two dozen roses is 24 roses.
3) Later that day, Danielle traded the box of chocolates for another dozen roses.
4) So now Danielle has 24 + 12 = 36 roses.
5) Overnight, half of the roses wilted, so Danielle had 36 / 2 = 18 unwilted roses remaining.
6) On the second day, another half of the remaining flowers wilted, so Danielle had 18 / 2 = 9 unwilted roses remaining.
