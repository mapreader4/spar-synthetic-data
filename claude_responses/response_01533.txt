Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jen bought a bag of cookies
* On the first day, she ate three-quarters of the bag
* On the second day, she ate half of the remaining cookies
* On the third day, she had 8 cookies left

First, let's calculate how many cookies were left after the first day:
* If she ate three-quarters of the bag, that means one-quarter of the bag was left
* So, if we let x be the number of cookies in the bag, then one-quarter of x is left after the first day

Next, let's calculate how many cookies were left after the second day:
* On the second day, she ate half of the remaining cookies
* So, half of one-quarter of x is left after the second day
* That means one-eighth of x is left after the second day

Finally, we know that on the third day, she had 8 cookies left. So:
* One-eighth of x = 8
* Solving for x, we get x = 64

Therefore, the bag of cookies contained 64 cookies to start.

Answer: 64
