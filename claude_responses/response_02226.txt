Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) In the first week, Paul used 24 cups of sugar for the cake recipe.
2) Each week after the first week, he reduced the amount of sugar by half.
3) So, in the second week, he used 24 / 2 = 12 cups of sugar.
4) In the third week, he used 12 / 2 = 6 cups of sugar.
5) In the fourth week, he used 6 / 2 = 3 cups of sugar.

Answer: 3 cups of sugar.
