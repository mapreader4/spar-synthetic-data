Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The eldest child is 20 years old now
* The siblings are born 5 years apart
* So the middle child is 15 years old now (20 - 5)
* And the youngest child is 10 years old now (20 - 10)
* In 10 years, the eldest child will be 30 years old (20 + 10)
* In 10 years, the middle child will be 25 years old (15 + 10)
* In 10 years, the youngest child will be 20 years old (10 + 10)
* The total of the ages of the three siblings 10 years from now will be:
30 + 25 + 20 = 75

Answer: 75
