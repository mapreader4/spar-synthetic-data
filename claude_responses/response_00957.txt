Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The grill burns 15 coals to ash every 20 minutes of grilling.
* The grill ran for long enough to burn 3 bags of coals.
* Each bag of coal contains 60 coals.

First, let's calculate the total number of coals burned:
* 3 bags of coals x 60 coals per bag = 180 coals

Now, let's calculate how long it takes to burn 180 coals, given that the grill burns 15 coals every 20 minutes:
* 180 coals / 15 coals per 20 minutes = 12 sets of 20 minutes
* 12 sets of 20 minutes = 240 minutes

Therefore, the grill ran for 240 minutes, or 4 hours.

Answer: 240
