Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Saturday, Tanika sold 60 boxes of crackers
* On Sunday, she sold 50% more than on Saturday
* To calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday, we take the number of boxes sold on Saturday (60) and increase it by 50%
* 50% of 60 is 30 (60 x 0.5 = 30)
* So, the number of boxes sold on Sunday is 60 + 30 = 90 boxes

Now, to find the total number of boxes sold over the two days, we add the number of boxes sold on Saturday (60) and the number of boxes sold on Sunday (90):
* 60 + 90 = 150 boxes

Answer: 150
