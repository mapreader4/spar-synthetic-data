Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brinley counted 100 snakes
* Brinley counted 80 arctic foxes
* Brinley counted 20 leopards
* Brinley saw ten times more bee-eaters than leopards
* Brinley saw half as many cheetahs as snakes
* Brinley saw twice as many alligators as the total number of Arctic foxes and leopards

First, let's calculate the number of bee-eaters:
* 10 times more bee-eaters than leopards
* 10 x 20 = 200 bee-eaters

Next, let's calculate the number of cheetahs:
* Half as many cheetahs as snakes
* 100 / 2 = 50 cheetahs

Now, let's calculate the number of alligators:
* Twice as many alligators as the total number of Arctic foxes and leopards
* 80 + 20 = 100 total Arctic foxes and leopards
* 100 x 2 = 200 alligators

Finally, let's add up the total number of animals:
* 100 snakes + 80 arctic foxes + 20 leopards + 200 bee-eaters + 50 cheetahs + 200 alligators
* 100 + 80 + 20 + 200 + 50 + 200 = 650 animals

Answer: 650
