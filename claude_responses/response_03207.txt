Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Josephine sold milk in three containers, each with 2 liters of milk
* So for the three 2-liter containers, the total amount of milk sold is:
  * 3 containers x 2 liters per container = 6 liters
* Josephine also sold milk in two containers, each with 0.75 liters of milk
* So for the two 0.75-liter containers, the total amount of milk sold is:
  * 2 containers x 0.75 liters per container = 1.5 liters
* Lastly, Josephine sold milk in five containers, each with 0.5 liters of milk
* So for the five 0.5-liter containers, the total amount of milk sold is:
  * 5 containers x 0.5 liters per container = 2.5 liters
* To calculate the total amount of milk sold, we add up the amounts from each set of containers:
  * 6 liters + 1.5 liters + 2.5 liters = 10 liters

Answer: 10 liters
