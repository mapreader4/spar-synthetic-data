Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jon's laundry machine can do 5 pounds of laundry at a time
* 4 shirts weigh 1 pound
* 2 pairs of pants weigh 1 pound
* Jon needs to wash 20 shirts and 20 pants

First, let's calculate the total weight of the laundry:
* 20 shirts = 20 * (1/4) pounds = 5 pounds
* 20 pants = 20 * (1/2) pounds = 10 pounds
* Total weight = 5 pounds + 10 pounds = 15 pounds

Now, since the laundry machine can do 5 pounds at a time, we need to calculate how many loads of laundry Jon has to do:
* 15 pounds / 5 pounds per load = 3 loads

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 3
