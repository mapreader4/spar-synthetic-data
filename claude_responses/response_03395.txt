Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that Canada is 1.5 times bigger than the United States.
2) We also know that Russia is 1/3 bigger than Canada.
3) To find how many times bigger Russia is than the United States, we can multiply the size of Russia compared to Canada by the size of Canada compared to the United States.
4) Russia is 1/3 bigger than Canada, so Russia is 1.33 times the size of Canada.
5) Canada is 1.5 times the size of the United States.
6) Therefore, Russia is 1.33 * 1.5 = 2 times bigger than the United States.
