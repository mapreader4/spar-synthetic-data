Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first trip, Ishmael counted 28 male whales and twice as many female whales.
   * Number of female whales = 2 x 28 = 56
   * Total whales on first trip = 28 + 56 = 84

2. On the second trip, Ishmael saw 8 baby whales, each travelling with their parents.
   * Total whales on second trip = 8 + (2 x 8) = 24

3. On the third trip, Ishmael counted half as many male whales as the first trip and the same number of female whales as on the first trip.
   * Number of male whales on third trip = 28 / 2 = 14
   * Number of female whales on third trip = 56
   * Total whales on third trip = 14 + 56 = 70

4. To get the total number of whales, we add up the whales from all three trips:
   * Total whales = 84 + 24 + 70 = 178

Answer: 178
