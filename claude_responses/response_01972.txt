Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The largest frog can grow to weigh 10 times as much as the smallest frog.
2) The largest frog weighs 120 pounds.
3) To find the weight of the smallest frog, we divide the weight of the largest frog by 10:
   * 120 pounds / 10 = 12 pounds
4) To find the difference in weight between the largest and smallest frog, we subtract the weight of the smallest frog from the weight of the largest frog:
   * 120 pounds - 12 pounds = 108 pounds

Answer: 108 pounds
