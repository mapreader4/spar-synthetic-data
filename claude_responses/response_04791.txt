Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cougar sleeps for 4 hours at night
* The zebra sleeps for 2 hours more than the cougar, which is 6 hours
* We want to find the total time both animals sleep in one week

To calculate the total time, we need to:
1. Calculate the total time the cougar sleeps in one week
2. Calculate the total time the zebra sleeps in one week
3. Add the two together

Step 1: Calculating the cougar's sleep time in one week
* The cougar sleeps for 4 hours per night
* There are 7 days in a week
* So the cougar sleeps for 4 hours x 7 days = 28 hours per week

Step 2: Calculating the zebra's sleep time in one week
* The zebra sleeps for 6 hours per night
* There are 7 days in a week
* So the zebra sleeps for 6 hours x 7 days = 42 hours per week

Step 3: Adding the two together
* Total sleep time = Cougar's sleep time + Zebra's sleep time
* Total sleep time = 28 hours + 42 hours = 70 hours

Answer: 70
