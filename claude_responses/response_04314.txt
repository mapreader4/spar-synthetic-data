Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carla needs to dry-clean 80 pieces of laundry
* She needs to have them all done by noon
* She starts work at 8 AM
* To find the number of pieces she needs to clean per hour, we need to divide the total number of pieces (80) by the number of hours she has to work (4 hours, from 8 AM to noon)

Calculation:
* Total pieces of laundry: 80
* Hours of work: 8 AM to noon = 4 hours
* Pieces of laundry per hour: 80 / 4 = 20

Answer: 20
