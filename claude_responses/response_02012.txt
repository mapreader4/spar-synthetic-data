Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ryan has 30 stickers.
2) Steven has thrice as many stickers as Ryan. That means Steven has 3 x 30 = 90 stickers.
3) Terry has 20 more stickers than Steven. That means Terry has 90 + 20 = 110 stickers.
4) To find the total number of stickers, we add up the stickers of all three people:
30 + 90 + 110 = 230

Answer: 230
