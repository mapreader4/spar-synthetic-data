Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 5 years ago, the mother was 41 - 5 = 36 years old
* 5 years ago, the mother was twice as old as her daughter
* So, 5 years ago, the daughter was 36 / 2 = 18 years old
* Now, the daughter is 18 + 5 = 23 years old
* In 3 years, the daughter will be 23 + 3 = 26 years old

Answer: 26
