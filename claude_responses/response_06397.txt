Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first employee works for $20 per hour.
2. The second employee works for $22 per hour, but Casey would get a $6/hour subsidy from the government for hiring a disabled worker.
3. Both employees work 40 hours per week.

To calculate the cost per week for each employee:
* First employee: $20 per hour x 40 hours per week = $800 per week
* Second employee: $22 per hour x 40 hours per week = $880 per week
   - However, with the $6/hour subsidy, the actual cost to Casey is $22 - $6 = $16 per hour
   - $16 per hour x 40 hours per week = $640 per week

Now, to calculate the savings:
* Cost of first employee: $800 per week
* Cost of second employee: $640 per week
* Savings = $800 - $640 = $160 per week

Answer: $160
