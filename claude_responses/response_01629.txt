Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The zoo has 50 new visitors entering the zoo every hour.
2) The zoo is open for 8 hours in one day.
3) To find the total number of visitors in one day, we multiply the number of visitors per hour (50) by the number of hours the zoo is open (8):
   50 visitors/hour x 8 hours = 400 total visitors in one day.
4) We are told that 80% of the total visitors go to the gorilla exhibit.
5) To find the number of visitors that go to the gorilla exhibit, we take the total number of visitors (400) and multiply it by 80% (0.8):
   400 total visitors x 0.8 = 320 visitors go to the gorilla exhibit.

Answer: 320 visitors go to the gorilla exhibit in one day.
