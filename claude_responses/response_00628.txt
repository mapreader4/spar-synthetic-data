Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Alani earned $45 for 3 hours of baby-sitting.
2) This means she earns $45 / 3 = $15 per hour.
3) We want to know how many hours she needs to baby-sit to earn $75.
4) We can set up a proportion:
   3 hours / $45 = x hours / $75
5) Cross-multiplying, we get:
   3 * $75 = $45 * x
6) Solving for x, we get:
   x = (3 * $75) / $45 = 5 hours.

Answer: 5 hours.
