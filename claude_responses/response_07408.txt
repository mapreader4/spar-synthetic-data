Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the first 30 minutes, the storm dropped 5 inches of rain.
* In the next 30 minutes, the storm dropped half of that amount, which is 2.5 inches.
* For the next hour, the storm dropped 1/2 inch of rain.
* To calculate the total rainfall, we add up the amounts:
  - 5 inches (first 30 minutes)
  - 2.5 inches (next 30 minutes)
  - 0.5 inches (next hour)
* The total rainfall is 5 + 2.5 + 0.5 = 8 inches.
* To calculate the average rainfall, we divide the total rainfall by the duration of the storm, which is 2 hours.
* The average rainfall is 8 inches / 2 hours = 4 inches per hour.
