Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kenny practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours.
2) He practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran.
3) Therefore, if he practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours, he ran for 20 hours (40 hours / 2 = 20 hours).
4) He ran for twice as long as he played basketball.
5) Therefore, if he ran for 20 hours, he played basketball for 10 hours (20 hours / 2 = 10 hours).

Answer: 10 hours
