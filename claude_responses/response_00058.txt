Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The survey found that 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 allowance per day
* The remaining 1/3 of the students receive an average of $4 allowance per day
* The total number of students surveyed is 60

To find the total amount of money the 60 students get in a day, we need to calculate the amount for each group and then add them together.

For the 2/3 of students who receive $6 per day:
* 2/3 of 60 students = 40 students
* 40 students x $6 per day = $240 per day

For the 1/3 of students who receive $4 per day:
* 1/3 of 60 students = 20 students
* 20 students x $4 per day = $80 per day

Now we add the two amounts together:
* $240 + $80 = $320 per day

Answer: 320
