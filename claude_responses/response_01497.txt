Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Henry had 33 games originally
* He gave 5 of those games to Neil
* So, Henry now has 33 - 5 = 28 games
* The problem states that Henry now has 4 times more games than Neil
* Let's call the number of games Neil had at first as x
* We know that Henry has 4 times more games than Neil, so Henry has 4x games
* We also know that Henry has 28 games, so 4x = 28
* Solving for x, we get x = 28 / 4 = 7

Therefore, the number of games Neil had at first is:
Answer: 7
