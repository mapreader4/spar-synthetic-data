Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ben's new car cost twice as much as his old car
* He sold his old car for $1800
* He used that $1800 to pay off some of the cost of his new car
* He still owes another $2000 on his new car

Since the new car cost twice as much as the old car, we can say that the cost of the new car is equal to 2 times the cost of the old car.

Let's call the cost of the old car "x". Then the cost of the new car is 2x.

We know that Ben used the $1800 from selling the old car to pay off part of the new car. So the amount he still owes on the new car is 2x - $1800.

We're told that he still owes $2000 on the new car, so:
2x - $1800 = $2000
2x = $3800
x = $1900

Therefore, the cost of Ben's old car was $1900.

Answer: $1900
