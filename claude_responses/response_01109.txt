Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mike received 3 oranges.
2) Matt got twice as many apples as Mike got oranges. Since Mike got 3 oranges, Matt got 2 x 3 = 6 apples.
3) Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether. Mike got 3 oranges, and Matt got 6 apples, so in total they received 3 + 6 = 9 fruits. Therefore, Mark got 9 bananas.
4) To find the total number of fruits the three children have, we add up the number of fruits each child received:
   Mike: 3 oranges
   Matt: 6 apples
   Mark: 9 bananas
   Total = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18 fruits

Answer: 18
