Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elias uses one bar of soap every month
* Each bar of soap costs $4
* We need to find how much he spends on bars of soap in two years

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Determine the number of months in two years
* There are 12 months in a year
* 2 years x 12 months/year = 24 months

2. Multiply the number of months by the cost of each bar of soap
* 24 months x $4/bar = $96

Therefore, the total amount Elias spends on bars of soap in two years is:
Answer: $96
