Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Donna worked 2 hours every morning walking dogs for $10.00 an hour.
   * 2 hours per day x $10.00 per hour = $20.00 per day
   * 5 days a week, so that's $20.00 x 5 = $100.00 per week

2. Donna worked 2 hours after school at a card shop for $12.50 an hour.
   * 2 hours per day x $12.50 per hour = $25.00 per day
   * 5 days a week, so that's $25.00 x 5 = $125.00 per week

3. Donna babysat on the weekends for $10.00 an hour, and was guaranteed 4 hours every Saturday.
   * 4 hours on Saturday x $10.00 per hour = $40.00 per Saturday
   * 1 day per week, so that's $40.00 per week

4. Now we add up the total earnings for the week:
   * $100.00 (dog walking) + $125.00 (card shop) + $40.00 (babysitting) = $265.00

Answer: $265
