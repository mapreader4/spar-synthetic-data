Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, Kim knit 8 sweaters.
2. On Tuesday, she knit 2 more sweaters than on Monday, so that's 8 + 2 = 10 sweaters.
3. On Wednesday and Thursday, she knit 4 fewer sweaters than on Tuesday, so that's 10 - 4 = 6 sweaters each day, for a total of 6 + 6 = 12 sweaters.
4. On Friday, she knit half the number of sweaters she had knit on Monday, which is 8 / 2 = 4 sweaters.

Now, let's add up the total number of sweaters she knit that week:
8 + 10 + 12 + 4 = 34 sweaters.

Answer: 34
