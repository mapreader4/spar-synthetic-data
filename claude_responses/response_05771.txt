Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 10 shirts
* He buys half as many pants, which means he buys 5 pants
* The shirts cost $6 each
* The pants cost $8 each
* To calculate the total cost:
  - Cost of shirts: 10 shirts x $6 per shirt = $60
  - Cost of pants: 5 pants x $8 per pant = $40
  - Total cost: $60 + $40 = $100

Answer: 100
