Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The port has 4 cruise ships.
2) The port has twice as many cargo ships as cruise ships. So, the number of cargo ships is 2 x 4 = 8 cargo ships.
3) The number of sailboats is 6 more than the number of cargo ships. So, the number of sailboats is 8 + 6 = 14 sailboats.
4) The number of fishing boats is 7 times less than the number of sailboats. So, the number of fishing boats is 14 / 7 = 2 fishing boats.
5) To find the total number of vessels, we add up the number of cruise ships, cargo ships, sailboats, and fishing boats:
4 + 8 + 14 + 2 = 28 vessels.

Answer: 28
