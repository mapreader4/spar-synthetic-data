Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 100 people in the theater
* 19 of them have blue eyes
* Half of the people have brown eyes
* A quarter of the people have black eyes
* The rest have green eyes

First, let's calculate the number of people with brown eyes:
* Half of 100 people = 50 people have brown eyes

Next, let's calculate the number of people with black eyes:
* A quarter of 100 people = 25 people have black eyes

Now, we can calculate the number of people with green eyes:
* Total people = 100
* People with blue eyes = 19
* People with brown eyes = 50
* People with black eyes = 25
* People with green eyes = 100 - 19 - 50 - 25 = 6
