Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that the mushrooms have either spots or gills, but never both.
2) We also know that gilled mushrooms are rare, with only one growing for every nine spotted mushrooms.
3) The fallen log had 30 mushrooms growing on its side.
4) To find the number of gilled mushrooms, we need to set up a ratio based on the information given.
5) The ratio of gilled mushrooms to spotted mushrooms is 1:9.
6) This means that for every 10 mushrooms, 1 is gilled and 9 are spotted.
7) Since there are 30 mushrooms total, we can divide 30 by 10 to get the number of groups of 10 mushrooms.
8) 30 / 10 = 3 groups of 10 mushrooms.
9) In each group of 10 mushrooms, 1 is gilled. 
10) Therefore, the number of gilled mushrooms on the fallen log's side is 3.
