Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Josh had some amount of money at first
* He spent $1.75 on a drink
* He then spent another $1.25
* After these two purchases, he had $6 left

To find the amount of money Josh had at first, we need to add up the amount he spent and the amount he had left.

The total amount he spent is:
* $1.75 + $1.25 = $3.00

The amount he had left is $6.

So, the total amount of money Josh had at first is:
* $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00

Answer: $9
