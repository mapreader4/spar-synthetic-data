Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The castle has enough provisions to feed 300 people for 90 days
* After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle
* So, the remaining 200 people will have enough food for:
  * 90 days / 300 people = 0.3 days per person
  * 200 people * 0.3 days per person = 60 days
* Therefore, the remaining food will last for 60 more days.

Answer: 60
