Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peter needs $5,000 to cover the spending for the vacation to Germany
* He currently has $2,900 in savings
* He can save up $700 each month

To find out how many months he needs to wait to reach his goal, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to save.
* Total needed: $5,000
* Current savings: $2,900
* Additional amount needed: $5,000 - $2,900 = $2,100

Now, we can calculate how many months it will take him to save the additional $2,100 by dividing it by his monthly savings of $700.
* $2,100 / $700 per month = 3 months

Therefore, Peter needs to wait 3 months to reach his goal of $5,000.
