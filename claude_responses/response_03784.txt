Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The tablecloth measures 102 inches by 54 inches.
   * To calculate the area of the tablecloth, we multiply the length and width:
   * 102 inches x 54 inches = 5,508 square inches

2) Sally also needs to make 8 napkins that are 6 inches by 7 inches.
   * To calculate the area of one napkin, we multiply the length and width:
   * 6 inches x 7 inches = 42 square inches
   * Since there are 8 napkins, we multiply the area of one napkin by 8:
   * 42 square inches x 8 = 336 square inches

3) To find the total area of material needed, we add the area of the tablecloth and the 8 napkins:
   * 5,508 square inches + 336 square inches = 5,844 square inches

Answer: 5,844 square inches
