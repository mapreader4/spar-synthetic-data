Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ian jogs 5 laps around the complex every night
* Each lap is 100 feet
* So, the total distance he jogs every night is 5 laps x 100 feet = 500 feet
* It takes 25 feet of jogging to burn 1 calorie
* So, the number of calories burned per night is 500 feet / 25 feet per calorie = 20 calories
* After 5 days of jogging, the total number of calories burned is 20 calories per night x 5 nights = 100 calories

Answer: 100
