Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Friday, Sandy worked 10 hours with her best friend. At $15 per hour, her earnings for Friday would be:
   10 hours x $15 per hour = $150

2. On Saturday, Sandy worked 6 hours alone. At $15 per hour, her earnings for Saturday would be:
   6 hours x $15 per hour = $90

3. On Sunday, Sandy worked 14 hours with her other co-workers. At $15 per hour, her earnings for Sunday would be:
   14 hours x $15 per hour = $210

4. To calculate the total amount of money Sandy earned over the 3 days, we add up the earnings from each day:
   $150 + $90 + $210 = $450

Answer: $450
