Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 30 cans of soup at a normal price of $0.60 per can.
2) The "buy 1 get 1 free" promotion means that for every 2 cans he buys, he only pays for 1.
3) So, for the 30 cans, he is effectively only paying for 15 cans.
4) The total cost would be 15 cans x $0.60 per can = $9.00.

Answer: $9
