Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Georgina's parrot knows 17 phrases so far
* The parrot knew 3 phrases when Georgina bought it
* Georgina is teaching the parrot 2 phrases per week

To find out how many days Georgina has had the parrot, we need to figure out how many weeks it took for the parrot to learn the additional 14 phrases (17 - 3 = 14).

* The parrot learned 14 additional phrases
* Georgina teaches 2 phrases per week
* So, it took 14 / 2 = 7 weeks for the parrot to learn the additional 14 phrases

Now, to find the number of days, we multiply the number of weeks by 7 days per week:
* 7 weeks x 7 days/week = 49 days

Answer: 49 days
