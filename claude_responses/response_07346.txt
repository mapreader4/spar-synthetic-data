Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Penelope has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies.
2) We are told that Penelope has 25 M&M candies.
3) We need to find out how many Starbursts candies she has.
4) Since she has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies, we can set up a proportion:
5 M&M candies / 3 Starbursts candies = 25 M&M candies / x Starbursts candies
5) Solving for x, we get:
x = (3 * 25) / 5 = 15 Starbursts candies.

Answer: 15
