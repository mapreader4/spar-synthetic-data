Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We have 6 kids who prefer peas, 9 kids who prefer carrots, and 5 kids who prefer corn.
2) To find the percentage of kids who prefer corn, we need to divide the number of kids who prefer corn by the total number of kids, and then multiply by 100.
3) The total number of kids is 6 + 9 + 5 = 20.
4) The number of kids who prefer corn is 5.
5) The percentage of kids who prefer corn is (5 / 20) * 100 = 25%.

Answer: 25
