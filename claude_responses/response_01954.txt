Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Andrew's dog has 12 burrs
* The dog has six times as many ticks as burrs
* To find the number of ticks, we multiply the number of burrs by 6:
* 12 burrs x 6 = 72 ticks
* To find the total number of foreign objects caught in the dog's fur, we add the number of burrs and the number of ticks:
* 12 burrs + 72 ticks = 84 foreign objects

Answer: 84
