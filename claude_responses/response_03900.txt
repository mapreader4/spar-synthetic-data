Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* We have 15 workers who worked for 6 days and earned a total of $9450
* To find the daily wage of each worker, we divide the total wages by the number of worker-days:
   - 15 workers x 6 days = 90 worker-days
   - $9450 / 90 worker-days = $105 per worker-day
* Now, we want to find the wages for 19 workers for 5 days
* The number of worker-days is 19 workers x 5 days = 95 worker-days
* To calculate the total wages, we multiply the number of worker-days by the daily wage:
   - 95 worker-days x $105 per worker-day = $9975

Answer: $9975
