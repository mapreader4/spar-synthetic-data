Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kenneth bought 700 oz of fabric.
2) Kenneth paid $40 per oz of fabric.
3) Therefore, the total amount Kenneth paid for the fabric is:
   700 oz x $40 per oz = $28,000
4) Nicholas bought six times as much fabric as Kenneth.
5) If Kenneth bought 700 oz, then Nicholas bought 6 x 700 = 4,200 oz of fabric.
6) Since Nicholas bought 6 times as much fabric as Kenneth, the amount of money Nicholas paid more than Kenneth is:
   (4,200 oz - 700 oz) x $40 per oz = 3,500 oz x $40 per oz = $140,000

Answer: $140,000
