Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Clothes take 30 minutes to wash
* Towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash
* Towels take 2 * 30 = 60 minutes to wash
* Sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels
* Sheets take 60 - 15 = 45 minutes to wash

Now, to calculate the total time it will take Naomi to wash everything:
* Clothes: 30 minutes
* Towels: 60 minutes
* Sheets: 45 minutes
* Total time = 30 + 60 + 45 = 135 minutes

Answer: 135
