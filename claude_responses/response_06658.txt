Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Tuesday, Anna ate 4 apples.
* On Wednesday, Anna ate double the apples she ate on Tuesday, which is 4 x 2 = 8 apples.
* On Thursday, Anna ate half the apples she ate on Tuesday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 apples.

Now, to find the total number of apples Anna has eaten by the end of these three days, we add up the apples she ate on each day:
* Tuesday: 4 apples
* Wednesday: 8 apples
* Thursday: 2 apples

The total number of apples Anna has eaten is:
4 + 8 + 2 = 14 apples

Answer: 14
