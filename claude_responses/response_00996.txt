Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James pays $20 to enter the club.
2) James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends, which is 10 drinks at $6 each. That's 10 x $6 = $60.
3) James buys 6 drinks for himself, which is 6 x $6 = $36.
4) James orders fried chicken for $14.
5) James leaves a 30% tip on the drinks and food he ordered. The total for the drinks and food is $60 + $36 + $14 = $110. The 30% tip on this is 0.3 x $110 = $33.
6) Adding up all the costs:
   - Club entry: $20
   - Drinks for friends: $60
   - Drinks for himself: $36
   - Fried chicken: $14
   - Tip: $33
   - Total: $20 + $60 + $36 + $14 + $33 = $163

Answer: 163
