Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg, so we can calculate Salem's original population as:
   * Salem's original population = 15 * Leesburg's population
   * Salem's original population = 15 * 58940 = 884,100 people
2) 130,000 people move out of Salem, so the new population of Salem is:
   * New population of Salem = 884,100 - 130,000 = 754,100 people
3) Half of Salem's population is women, so the number of women in Salem is:
   * Number of women in Salem = 754,100 / 2 = 377,050 women

Answer: 377,050
