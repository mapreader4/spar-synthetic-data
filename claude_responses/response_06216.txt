Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The school has a gym budget.
2) They decided to add 20% to the gym budget.
3) In a normal month, they could buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each if they spent the entire budget on that.
4) If they only buy softballs instead, which cost $9 each, we need to find how many they can buy with the new budget.

First, let's calculate the original gym budget:
* 15 dodgeballs x $5 each = $75 original gym budget

Now, let's calculate the new gym budget after the 20% increase:
* $75 original budget x 1.20 (20% increase) = $90 new gym budget

Finally, let's calculate how many softballs they can buy with the new $90 budget:
* $90 new budget / $9 per softball = 10 softballs

Answer: 10
