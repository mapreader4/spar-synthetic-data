Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The class has 39 students in total.
* One-third of the class took part in the math competition.
* To find the number of students who participated in the competition, we take one-third of the total number of students:
* 1/3 of 39 = 39 * 1/3 = 13 students participated in the competition.
* To find the number of students who did not participate, we subtract the number of participants from the total number of students:
* 39 - 13 = 26 students did not participate in the competition.

Answer: 26
