Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The distance between Spain and Russia is 7019 km
* The distance between Spain and Germany is 1615 km
* Peter took a flight from Spain, with a stopover in Germany, and then needs to fly to Russia and back to Spain
* To find the total distance Peter needs to fly, we need to add the following:
  - The distance from Spain to Germany (1615 km)
  - The distance from Germany to Russia (7019 km - 1615 km = 5404 km)
  - The distance from Russia back to Spain (7019 km)
* Adding these together, we get:
  - 1615 km + 5404 km + 7019 km = 14038 km

Answer: 14038
