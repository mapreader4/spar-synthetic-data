Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Roland has a 12cm long thread.
2) His teacher says he needs an additional three-quarters of what he has.
3) To find the additional length, we take three-quarters of 12cm:
   * 3/4 * 12cm = 9cm
4) To find the total length required, we add the original 12cm to the additional 9cm:
   * 12cm + 9cm = 21cm

Answer: 21
