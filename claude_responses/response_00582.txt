Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Haruto's tomato plants grew 127 tomatoes
2) Birds had eaten 19 of the tomatoes
3) So the number of tomatoes Haruto picked is 127 - 19 = 108 tomatoes
4) Haruto gave half of his tomatoes to his friend, which means he gave away 108 / 2 = 54 tomatoes
5) The number of tomatoes Haruto has left is 108 - 54 = 54 tomatoes

Answer: 54
