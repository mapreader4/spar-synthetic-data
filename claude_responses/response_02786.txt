Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom needs to cross the lake in one direction, which takes 4 hours
* To cross the lake back and forth, he needs to do this twice (once in each direction)
* So the total time required to cross the lake back and forth is 4 hours x 2 = 8 hours
* The cost of hiring an assistant is $10 per hour
* Therefore, the total cost for hiring an assistant to help Tom cross the lake back and forth would be:
8 hours x $10 per hour = $80

Answer: $80
