Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sean buys 3 cans of soda, each costing $1. So the total cost of the soda is 3 * $1 = $3.
2) Each soup costs as much as the 3 combined sodas, which is $3. Sean buys 2 soups, so the total cost of the soups is 2 * $3 = $6.
3) The sandwich costs 3 times as much as the soup, which is 3 * $3 = $9.
4) To find the total cost, we add up the cost of the soda, soups, and sandwich:
$3 + $6 + $9 = $18.

Answer: 18
