Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Isaac rides his bicycle at a rate of 10 miles per hour for 30 minutes.
   * In 30 minutes, he would have traveled 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 5 miles.
2) He then rides for another 15 miles.
   * At a rate of 10 miles per hour, this would take 15 miles / 10 miles per hour = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes.
3) He then rests for 30 minutes.
4) He then covers the remaining distance of 20 miles.
   * At a rate of 10 miles per hour, this would take 20 miles / 10 miles per hour = 2 hours = 120 minutes.

Adding up the time:
* 30 minutes + 90 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes = 270 minutes.

Answer: 270
