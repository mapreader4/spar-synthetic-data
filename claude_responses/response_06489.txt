Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The squirrel had stashed 210 acorns for the three winter months.
2) It divided the pile into thirds, one for each month.
3) Each third had 210/3 = 70 acorns.
4) The squirrel then took some from each third, leaving 60 acorns for each winter month.
5) So, the squirrel took 70 - 60 = 10 acorns from each third.
6) The squirrel combined the 10 acorns it took from each third, so it has 3 * 10 = 30 acorns to eat at the beginning of spring.

Answer: 30
