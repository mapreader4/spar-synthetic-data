Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The sum of the ages of Jeremy, Sebastian, and Sophia in three years is 150.
2) Currently, Sebastian is 4 years older than Jeremy.
3) Jeremy's age is 40.

First, let's find Sebastian's current age:
* Jeremy's current age is 40
* Sebastian is 4 years older than Jeremy
* Therefore, Sebastian's current age is 40 + 4 = 44

Now, let's find Sophia's current age:
* The sum of the ages of Jeremy, Sebastian, and Sophia in three years is 150
* Jeremy will be 43 in three years (40 + 3)
* Sebastian will be 47 in three years (44 + 3) 
* So the sum of their ages in three years is 43 + 47 + Sophia's age in three years
* 43 + 47 + Sophia's age in three years = 150
* Sophia's age in three years = 150 - 43 - 47 = 60
* Therefore, Sophia's current age is 60 - 3 = 57

Answer: 60
