Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony needs to drive 10 miles to get groceries
* He also needs to drive 15 miles to get a haircut
* And he needs to drive 5 miles to go to a doctor's appointment
* To find the total distance he will have driven when he is halfway through his errands, we need to add up the distances for each errand and divide by 2.
* 10 miles + 15 miles + 5 miles = 30 miles
* 30 miles / 2 = 15 miles

Answer: 15 miles
