Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Period 1 gym class has 5 fewer than twice as many students as in the Period 2 gym class.
2) Let's call the number of students in the Period 2 gym class "x".
3) Then, the number of students in the Period 1 gym class is 2x - 5.
4) We are told that there are 11 students in the Period 1 gym class, so:
2x - 5 = 11
5) Solving for x, we get:
2x - 5 = 11
2x = 16
x = 8

Answer: 8
