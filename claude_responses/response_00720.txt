Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mr. Callen bought 10 paintings at $40 each, so the total cost of the paintings is:
   10 paintings x $40 per painting = $400

2. Mr. Callen bought 8 wooden toys at $20 each, so the total cost of the toys is:
   8 toys x $20 per toy = $160

3. The total cost of all the items is the sum of the cost of the paintings and the toys:
   $400 + $160 = $560

4. The selling price of each painting was 10% less than the purchase price, so the selling price per painting is:
   $40 - (10% of $40) = $40 - $4 = $36 per painting

5. The selling price of each toy was 15% less than the purchase price, so the selling price per toy is:
   $20 - (15% of $20) = $20 - $3 = $17 per toy

6. The total selling price of the paintings is:
   10 paintings x $36 per painting = $360

7. The total selling price of the toys is:
   8 toys x $17 per toy = $136

8. The total selling price of all the items is the sum of the selling prices of the paintings and toys:
   $360 + $136 = $496

9. The total loss is the difference between the total cost and the total selling price:
   $560 - $496 = $64

Answer: $64
