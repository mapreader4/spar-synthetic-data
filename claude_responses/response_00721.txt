Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Smartphones cost $300 each
* Personal computers cost $500 more than smartphones, so they cost $300 + $500 = $800 each
* Advanced tablets cost the sum of the prices of a smartphone and a personal computer, so they cost $300 + $800 = $1,100 each

To buy one of each of the three products, we need to add up the individual prices:
* Smartphone: $300
* Personal computer: $800
* Advanced tablet: $1,100

The total cost to buy one of each of the three products is:
$300 + $800 + $1,100 = $2,200

Answer: $2,200
