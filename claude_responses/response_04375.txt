Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The quarterback throws a total of 50 passes in the game
* He throws twice as many passes to the right side of the field than to the left side
* Let's say he throws x passes to the left side of the field
* Since he throws twice as many to the right, he throws 2x passes to the right side
* He also throws 2 more passes to the center than to the left
* So, the number of passes to the center is x + 2
* The total number of passes is 50, so we can set up an equation:
x + 2x + (x + 2) = 50
4x + 2 = 50
4x = 48
x = 12

Answer: 12
