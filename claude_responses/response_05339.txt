Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The woman has two options:
   a. Buy a single 16 oz package of store-brand butter for $7.
   b. Buy an 8 oz package of store butter for $4 and use a coupon to get two additional 4 oz packages at a 50% discount.

2. Option B:
   a. The 8 oz package of store butter costs $4.
   b. The two 4 oz packages normally sell for $2.0 each.
   c. With the 50% discount, each 4 oz package costs $1.0.
   d. The total cost for the two 4 oz packages is 2 * $1.0 = $2.0.
   e. The total cost for Option B is $4.0 + $2.0 = $6.0.

3. Comparing the two options:
   a. Option A (single 16 oz package) costs $7.0.
   b. Option B (8 oz package + two 4 oz packages) costs $6.0.

Therefore, the lowest price the woman can pay for the 16 oz of butter she needs is $6.0.
