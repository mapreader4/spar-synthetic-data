Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Last month, Lily finished reading 4 books.
* This month, Lily wants to finish reading twice as many books as she finished last month.
* To calculate how many books she wants to finish this month:
  - Last month she finished 4 books
  - She wants to finish twice as many this month
  - So this month she wants to finish 4 x 2 = 8 books
* To calculate the total number of books she will finish for the two months:
  - Last month she finished 4 books
  - This month she wants to finish 8 books
  - So the total number of books she will finish for the two months is 4 + 8 = 12 books

Answer: 12
