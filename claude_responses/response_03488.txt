Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Evan had 200 books two years ago
* Evan currently owns 40 fewer books than he had two years ago
* To find the number of books Evan currently owns, we take the number of books he had two years ago (200) and subtract 40:
* 200 - 40 = 160 books
* In five years, Evan will have 60 more than five times as many books as he owns now
* To find the number of books Evan will have in five years, we first find five times the number of books he currently owns:
* 5 x 160 = 800 books
* Then we add 60 to that number:
* 800 + 60 = 860 books

Answer: 860 books
