Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The club currently has 10 members.
2) The club wants to have 5 more than twice their current number of members.
3) To find the desired number of members, we can use the equation:
Desired number of members = 2 × Current number of members + 5
4) Plugging in the current number of members (10), we get:
Desired number of members = 2 × 10 + 5 = 25
5) To find the number of additional members needed, we subtract the current number of members from the desired number of members:
Additional members needed = 25 - 10 = 15

Answer: 15
