Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Option 1: Buying a new computer for $600 that lasts 6 years.
   - Cost of new computer: $600

2. Option 2: Buying 2 used computers for $200 each, each lasting 3 years.
   - Cost of 2 used computers: $200 x 2 = $400
   - Total duration of 2 used computers: 3 years x 2 = 6 years

3. Comparing the two options:
   - Option 1 (new computer) costs $600 and lasts 6 years.
   - Option 2 (2 used computers) costs $400 and also lasts 6 years.

4. To calculate the savings:
   - Cost of Option 1 (new computer): $600
   - Cost of Option 2 (2 used computers): $400
   - Savings = Cost of Option 1 - Cost of Option 2 = $600 - $400 = $200

Answer: $200
