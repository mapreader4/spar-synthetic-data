Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The number of tanks is five times the number of trucks.
2) There are 20 trucks in the yard.
3) So, the number of tanks is 5 times 20, which is 100.
4) The total number of tanks and trucks in the yard is the sum of the number of tanks and the number of trucks.
5) The number of tanks is 100, and the number of trucks is 20.
6) Therefore, the total number of tanks and trucks in the yard is 100 + 20 = 120.

Answer: 120
