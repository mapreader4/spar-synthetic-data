Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lucius spends $10 every day on ingredients.
2) He makes a portion of French Fries and a portion of Poutine and sells them to the market.
3) The price of French Fries is $12 and the price of Poutine is $8.
4) He pays 10% of his weekly income as tax.

To calculate his weekly earnings after paying taxes and buying ingredients:
* Ingredients cost per week: $10 x 7 days = $70
* Revenue from selling French Fries: 1 portion x $12 = $12
* Revenue from selling Poutine: 1 portion x $8 = $8
* Total revenue per day: $12 + $8 = $20
* Total revenue per week: $20 x 7 days = $140
* Tax paid per week: 10% of $140 = $14
* Earnings after paying tax and buying ingredients: $140 - $14 - $70 = $56

Answer: $56
