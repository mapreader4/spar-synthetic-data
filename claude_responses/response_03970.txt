Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carla adds 1 can of chilis to a normal batch of chili
* She also adds 2 cans of beans to the normal batch
* She adds 50% more tomatoes than beans to the normal batch
* 50% of 2 cans of beans is 1 can of tomatoes
* So, the normal batch contains:
    - 1 can of chilis
    - 2 cans of beans
    - 1 can of tomatoes
* Carla is making a quadruple batch, which means she needs 4 times the ingredients of the normal batch
* For the quadruple batch, she needs:
    - 4 cans of chilis
    - 8 cans of beans
    - 4 cans of tomatoes
* Adding these up, the total number of cans of food she needs is:
    - 4 + 8 + 4 = 16 cans

Answer: 16
