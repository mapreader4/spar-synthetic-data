Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that John has twice the number of children that Yasmin has.
2) We also know that Gabriel has six grandkids.
3) Since John has twice the number of children that Yasmin has, and Gabriel has six grandkids, we can infer that Yasmin has half the number of children that John has.
4) If Yasmin has half the number of children that John has, and Gabriel has six grandkids, then Yasmin must have three children.
