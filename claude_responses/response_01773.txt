Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Savannah has 3 rolls of wrapping paper
* She has 12 gifts to wrap
* 1 roll of wrapping paper can wrap 3 gifts
* 1 roll of wrapping paper can wrap 5 other gifts
* We need to find how many gifts she wrapped with the third roll of paper

First, let's calculate how many gifts she wrapped with the first two rolls of paper:
* 1 roll for 3 gifts
* 1 roll for 5 other gifts
* That's a total of 8 gifts wrapped with the first two rolls

Now, we know that she wrapped a total of 12 gifts, and she used 8 of them with the first two rolls. 
* So, the number of gifts she wrapped with the third roll is 12 - 8 = 4
