Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Papi Calot planned to plant 7 rows of 18 plants each.
2) To calculate the total number of plants in the 7 rows, we multiply 7 (the number of rows) by 18 (the number of plants in each row):
7 x 18 = 126 plants
3) Papi Calot also plans to add 15 additional potato plants.
4) To find the total number of plants Papi Calot needs to buy, we add the 126 plants from the 7 rows and the 15 additional plants:
126 + 15 = 141 plants

Answer: 141
