Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* There were 9 seasons before the announcement
* Each season has 22 episodes, except for the last season which has 4 more episodes
* The last season has 22 + 4 = 26 episodes
* Each episode is 0.5 hours long

To calculate the total time to watch all the episodes:
* 9 seasons x 22 episodes per season = 198 episodes
* 1 season x 26 episodes = 26 episodes
* Total episodes = 198 + 26 = 224 episodes
* 224 episodes x 0.5 hours per episode = 112 hours

Answer: 112 hours
