Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The first staircase has 20 steps.
2. The second staircase has twice as many steps as the first, so it has 20 x 2 = 40 steps.
3. The final staircase has 10 fewer steps than the second one, so it has 40 - 10 = 30 steps.
4. Each step is 0.5 feet.
5. To calculate the total distance climbed, we need to add up the number of steps in each staircase and multiply by the step height:
   - First staircase: 20 steps x 0.5 feet = 10 feet
   - Second staircase: 40 steps x 0.5 feet = 20 feet
   - Third staircase: 30 steps x 0.5 feet = 15 feet
6. The total distance climbed is the sum of the distances for each staircase:
   - 10 feet + 20 feet + 15 feet = 45 feet

Answer: 45
