Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brenda's adult mice had 3 litters of 8 each, so that's 3 x 8 = 24 baby mice.
2) Brenda gave Robbie a sixth of the baby mice, which is 24 / 6 = 4 baby mice.
3) Brenda sold 3 times the number of babies she gave to Robbie, which is 3 x 4 = 12 baby mice.
4) The remaining number of baby mice is 24 - 4 - 12 = 8 baby mice.
5) Brenda sold half of the remaining 8 baby mice to snake owners as feeder mice, which is 8 / 2 = 4 baby mice.
6) The number of baby mice Brenda had left is 8 - 4 = 4 baby mice.
