Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The dog can run at 24 miles per hour, and the rabbit can run at 15 miles per hour.
2) The rabbit has a head start of 0.6 miles.
3) To find the time it takes for the dog to catch up to the rabbit, we need to find the relative speed between the dog and the rabbit.
4) The relative speed is the difference between the dog's speed and the rabbit's speed, which is 24 miles per hour - 15 miles per hour = 9 miles per hour.
5) The distance the dog needs to cover to catch up to the rabbit is the head start of 0.6 miles.
6) To find the time it takes for the dog to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed: 0.6 miles / 9 miles per hour = 0.0667 hours.
7) Converting this to minutes, we have 0.0667 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 4 minutes.

Answer: 4 minutes
