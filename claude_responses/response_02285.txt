Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kendy made 2 online bank transactions
* She transferred $60 to her mom
* She transferred half of $60, which is $30, to her sister
* After these transfers, her account now has $100 left in it

To find the amount of money in the account before the transfer, we need to add up the amounts she transferred and the amount left in the account.

The total amount transferred is:
* $60 to her mom
* $30 to her sister
* Total transferred = $60 + $30 = $90

The amount left in the account is $100.

Therefore, the amount of money in the account before the transfer was:
* $100 (left in account) + $90 (total transferred) = $190

Answer: 190
