Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ali used 8 boxes to make each of his circles
* Ali made 5 circles
* So, Ali used 8 * 5 = 40 boxes
* Ernie used 10 boxes to make each of his circles
* They had 80 boxes to begin with
* So, the remaining boxes after Ali's 5 circles is 80 - 40 = 40 boxes
* To find how many circles Ernie can make, we divide the remaining 40 boxes by the 10 boxes Ernie uses per circle
* 40 / 10 = 4
