Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Justin needs to collect one flower for each of his 30 classmates
* It takes him an average of 10 minutes to find a flower he likes
* He has been gathering for 2 hours, which is 120 minutes
* He has lost 3 of the flowers he initially gathered

First, let's calculate how many flowers he has gathered so far:
* 120 minutes / 10 minutes per flower = 12 flowers gathered

Now, let's subtract the 3 flowers he lost:
* 12 flowers - 3 lost flowers = 9 flowers

So, he has 9 flowers currently.

Now, we need to find out how many more flowers he needs to collect:
* 30 classmates - 9 flowers = 21 more flowers needed

Finally, we can calculate how many more minutes he needs to look:
* 21 more flowers x 10 minutes per flower = 210 more minutes needed

Answer: 210
