Okay, let's break this down step by step:

On Monday, Amanda has 5 appointments, each lasting 1.5 hours. So, the total time spent on Monday is:
5 appointments x 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours

On Tuesday, Amanda has 1 appointment that lasts 3 hours.

On Thursday, Amanda has 2 appointments, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total time spent on Thursday is:
2 appointments x 2 hours = 4 hours

On Saturday, Amanda will spend 6 hours at one client's house.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours Amanda will work this week:
Monday: 7.5 hours
Tuesday: 3 hours
Thursday: 4 hours
Saturday: 6 hours
Total hours: 7.5 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 20.5 hours

Amanda charges $20.00 per hour, so the total amount of money she will make this week is:
20.5 hours x $20.00 per hour = $410.00

Answer: $410
