Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maggie picked 40 apples
* Kelsey picked 28 apples
* The three girls averaged 30 apples picked
* To find the total number of apples picked, we multiply the average (30) by the number of girls (3):
  * 30 apples x 3 girls = 90 apples
* Now we know the total number of apples picked is 90.
* We also know that Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples.
* To find how many apples Layla picked, we subtract the apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey from the total apples picked:
  * 90 apples - 40 apples (Maggie) - 28 apples (Kelsey) = 22 apples

Answer: 22
