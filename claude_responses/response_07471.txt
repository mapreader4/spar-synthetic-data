Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 35 children in Janet's class
* There are 5 volunteer chaperones
* Janet herself is also getting a sack lunch
* So the total number of people getting sack lunches is 35 + 5 + 1 = 41
* Janet also ordered 3 additional sack lunches, just in case
* So the total number of sack lunches ordered is 41 + 3 = 44
* Each sack lunch costs $7
* To calculate the total cost, we multiply the number of sack lunches (44) by the cost per sack lunch ($7)
* 44 * $7 = $308

Answer: $308
