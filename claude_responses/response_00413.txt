Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ryan has a total of 40 balls
* There are twice as many red balls as blue balls
* There are 11 blue balls
* So, if there are 11 blue balls, then there must be 2 x 11 = 22 red balls
* Now, we know the total number of balls is 40, and we have 22 red balls and 11 blue balls
* To find the number of green balls, we need to subtract the red and blue balls from the total:
* 40 total balls - 22 red balls - 11 blue balls = 7 green balls
