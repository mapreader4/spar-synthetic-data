Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Thomas ordered:
  - 3 shirts at $12.00 each, so 3 x $12.00 = $36.00
  - 1 pack of socks for $5.00
  - 2 pairs of shorts at $15.00 each, so 2 x $15.00 = $30.00
  - 1 pair of swim trunks for $14.00
* The total purchase price is the sum of all these items:
  - $36.00 + $5.00 + $30.00 + $14.00 = $85.00
* Since the total purchase price is above $50.00, the shipping charge will be 20% of the purchase price:
  - 20% of $85.00 = 0.20 x $85.00 = $17.00
* Therefore, the total bill including shipping will be:
  - $85.00 + $17.00 = $102.00

Answer: $102
