Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The large pizza costs $10.00 and is cut into 8 slices, so the cost per slice is $10.00 / 8 = $1.25 per slice.
2) The first topping costs $2.00.
3) The next 2 toppings (sausage and ham) cost $1.00 each, so that's $2.00 total.
4) The remaining 4 toppings (olives, mushrooms, bell peppers, and pineapple) cost $0.50 each, so that's $2.00 total.
5) Adding up the cost of the pizza and the toppings, the total cost is $10.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $16.00.
6) Dividing the total cost by the 8 slices, the cost per slice is $16.00 / 8 = $2.00 per slice.

Answer: $2.00 per slice.
