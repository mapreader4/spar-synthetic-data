Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mike spent a total of $37 on 12 notebooks
* He bought 3 red notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost of the red notebooks is 3 * $4 = $12
* He bought 2 green notebooks at $2 each, so the total cost of the green notebooks is 2 * $2 = $4
* The total cost of the red and green notebooks is $12 + $4 = $16
* The remaining cost is $37 - $16 = $21, which must be the cost of the blue notebooks
* Since Mike bought a total of 12 notebooks, and 3 were red and 2 were green, the remaining 7 must be blue notebooks
* Therefore, the cost of each blue notebook is $21 / 7 = $3
