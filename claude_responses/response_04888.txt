Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bicycle costs $150.
2) Patrick saved half the price, which is $150 / 2 = $75.
3) He then lent $50 to his friend.
4) To calculate how much money Patrick has now, we take the amount he saved ($75) and subtract the amount he lent to his friend ($50).
5) $75 - $50 = $25.

Answer: 25
