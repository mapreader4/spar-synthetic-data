Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jim had 365 trading cards
* He gave 8 sets of cards to his brother
* Each set has 13 trading cards
* So for his brother, he gave away 8 sets x 13 cards per set = 104 cards
* He gave 5 sets of cards to his sister
* Each set has 13 trading cards
* So for his sister, he gave away 5 sets x 13 cards per set = 65 cards
* He gave 2 sets of cards to his friend
* Each set has 13 trading cards
* So for his friend, he gave away 2 sets x 13 cards per set = 26 cards
* To calculate the total number of cards he gave away, we add up the cards given to his brother, sister, and friend:
* 104 + 65 + 26 = 195 cards

Answer: 195
