Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It costs $50 to get each cat ready for adoption
* It costs $100 to get each adult dog ready for adoption
* It costs $150 to get each puppy ready for adoption
* 2 cats were adopted
* 3 adult dogs were adopted
* 2 puppies were adopted

To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of each animal by the cost to get them ready, and then add up the results:

* Cost for 2 cats: 2 x $50 = $100
* Cost for 3 adult dogs: 3 x $100 = $300
* Cost for 2 puppies: 2 x $150 = $300

Adding these up, we get:
$100 + $300 + $300 = $700

Answer: $700
