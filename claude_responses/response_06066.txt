Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Alan is buying:
   - 2 CDs by "The Dark"
   - 1 CD by "AVN"
   - 5 CDs of 90s music

2. The price of the "AVN" CD is $12, and it is half the price of one CD by "The Dark".
   - So, the price of one CD by "The Dark" is $24 (2 x $12).

3. The 5 CDs of 90s music cost 40% of the total cost of all the other CDs.
   - The total cost of the 2 CDs by "The Dark" and the 1 CD by "AVN" is $60 (2 x $24 + $12).
   - The cost of the 5 CDs of 90s music is 40% of $60, which is $24 (0.4 x $60).

Now, we can calculate the total cost:
- 2 CDs by "The Dark" at $24 each: $48
- 1 CD by "AVN" at $12: $12
- 5 CDs of 90s music at $24: $24
- Total cost: $48 + $12 + $24 = $84

Answer: $84
