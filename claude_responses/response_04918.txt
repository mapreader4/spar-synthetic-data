Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bailey scored 14 points.
2) Michiko scored half as many points as Bailey, so Michiko scored 7 points.
3) Akiko scored 4 more points than Michiko, so Akiko scored 11 points.
4) Chandra scored twice as many points as Akiko, so Chandra scored 22 points.
5) To find the total points scored by the team, we add up the points scored by each player:
   Bailey: 14 points
   Michiko: 7 points
   Akiko: 11 points
   Chandra: 22 points
   Total points scored = 14 + 7 + 11 + 22 = 54 points

Answer: 54
