Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The factory manufactures 300 gummy bears per minute.
2) Each packet of gummy bears has 50 gummy bears inside.
3) We need to find how long it would take to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.
4) To fill 240 packets, we need 240 * 50 = 12,000 gummy bears.
5) Since the factory produces 300 gummy bears per minute, it would take 12,000 / 300 = 40 minutes to produce 12,000 gummy bears.

Answer: 40 minutes.
