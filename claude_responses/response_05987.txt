Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Making the canvas bag released 600 pounds of carbon dioxide
* Each plastic bag released 4 ounces of carbon dioxide
* Marla uses 8 bags per shopping trip
* There are 16 ounces in a pound

First, we need to calculate the total carbon dioxide released from the plastic bags used in one shopping trip:
* 8 bags x 4 ounces per bag = 32 ounces of carbon dioxide per shopping trip

Next, we need to convert the 32 ounces of carbon dioxide to pounds:
* 32 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 2 pounds of carbon dioxide per shopping trip

Now, we need to find how many shopping trips Marla would need to make before the carbon dioxide from the plastic bags equals the 600 pounds released from making the canvas bag:
* 600 pounds / 2 pounds per trip = 300 shopping trips

Answer: 300
