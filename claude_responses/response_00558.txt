Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack was told to send the codes from 6 $500 Best Buy gift cards and 9 $200 Walmart gift cards
* He sent the codes for 1 Best Buy gift card and 2 Walmart gift cards
* For the Best Buy gift cards, he sent the codes for 1 out of 6 cards, so he has 5 remaining
* For the Walmart gift cards, he sent the codes for 2 out of 9 cards, so he has 7 remaining
* The value of the remaining Best Buy gift cards is 5 * $500 = $2,500
* The value of the remaining Walmart gift cards is 7 * $200 = $1,400
* Adding these together, the total value of the gift cards Jack can still return is:
Answer: $2,500 + $1,400 = $3,900
