Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lara is using 4 baking trays
* On each tray, she places 5 rows of cookies
* In each row, there are 6 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of cookies on one tray
2. Multiply that by the number of trays

Number of cookies on one tray:
* 5 rows x 6 cookies per row = 30 cookies per tray

Number of cookies across all 4 trays:
* 30 cookies per tray x 4 trays = 120 cookies

Answer: 120
