Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tina is getting $20 for each book she sells
* She realizes a $120 profit on her sales
* Each book costs $5 to make
* Every customer buys 2 at a time

First, let's calculate the total revenue Tina made from selling the books:
* Profit = $120
* Cost to make each book = $5
* Therefore, the total revenue = Profit + Cost to make all books
* Total revenue = $120 + (Cost to make all books)

Now, let's find the cost to make all the books:
* Cost to make each book = $5
* Each customer buys 2 books at a time
* So, the number of books sold = 2 x number of customers

Plugging this in, we get:
* Total cost to make all books = 2 x number of customers x $5

Now, we can solve for the total revenue:
* Total revenue = $120 + (2 x number of customers x $5)
* Total revenue = $120 + $10 x number of customers

We know that Tina is getting $20 for each book she sells, so:
* Total revenue = $20 x number of books sold
* $20 x number of books sold = $120 + $10 x number of customers
* Number of books sold = 6 + 0.5 x number of customers

Since each customer buys 2 books, the number of customers is half the number of books sold:
* Number of customers = (6 + 0.5 x number of customers) / 2
* Number of customers = 3 + 0.25 x number of customers
* 0.75 x number of customers = 3
* Number of customers = 4
