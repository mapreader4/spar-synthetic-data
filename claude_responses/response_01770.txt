Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The introduction is 450 words
* The conclusion is triple the length of the introduction, so that's 3 * 450 = 1350 words
* The four body sections are all the same length
* The total length of the essay is 5000 words

Now, we need to find the length of each body section. To do this, we need to subtract the introduction and conclusion from the total word count, and then divide the remaining words by the number of body sections.

Total words - (introduction + conclusion) = words left for body sections
5000 - (450 + 1350) = 3200 words

There are 4 body sections, so we divide the remaining 3200 words by 4 to get the length of each body section:
3200 / 4 = 800 words

Therefore, the length of each section is:
* Introduction: 450 words
* Conclusion: 1350 words
* Each body section: 800 words

Answer: 450, 1350, 800, 800, 800
