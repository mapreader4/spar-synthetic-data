Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jazel has 3 sticks.
2) The first stick is 3 centimeters long.
3) The second stick is twice as long as the first stick, so it is 2 x 3 = 6 centimeters long.
4) The third stick is 1 centimeter shorter than the second stick, so it is 6 - 1 = 5 centimeters long.
5) To find the total length of all 3 sticks, we add up the lengths of the individual sticks:
3 cm + 6 cm + 5 cm = 14 cm.

Answer: 14
