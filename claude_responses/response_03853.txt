Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each slice of cheesecake contains 350 calories
* There are a total of 2800 calories in every cheesecake
* Kiley ate 25% of the cheesecake

First, we need to find out how many slices are in a whole cheesecake:
* 2800 calories in a whole cheesecake / 350 calories per slice = 8 slices in a whole cheesecake

Next, we need to find out how many slices Kiley ate:
* Kiley ate 25% of the cheesecake
* 25% of 8 slices = 0.25 * 8 = 2 slices

Therefore, Kiley ate 2 slices of cheesecake.
