Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom weighs 150 kg
* He can hold 1.5 times his weight in each hand
* He is wearing a weight vest that weighs half his weight

First, let's calculate how much weight he can hold in each hand:
* 1.5 times his weight in each hand = 1.5 * 150 kg = 225 kg per hand

Next, let's calculate the weight of the vest:
* The vest weighs half his weight = 0.5 * 150 kg = 75 kg

Now, we can calculate the total weight he is moving with:
* Weight in left hand + weight in right hand + weight of vest = 225 kg + 225 kg + 75 kg = 525 kg

Answer: 525
