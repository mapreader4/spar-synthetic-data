Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The new iPhone costs $800
* Carrie can trade in her Samsung Galaxy for $240
* This means the remaining cost of the iPhone is $800 - $240 = $560
* Carrie can make $80 per week babysitting
* To calculate how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the remaining cost ($560) by her weekly earnings ($80 per week)
* $560 / $80 per week = 7 weeks

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 7
