Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Brandon has 20 baseball cards.
2) Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon, so Malcom has 20 + 8 = 28 cards.
3) Malcom then gives half of his cards to his friend Mark. This means Malcom gives away 28 / 2 = 14 cards.
4) Therefore, Malcom has 28 - 14 = 14 cards left.

Answer: 14
