Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Theresa bought twice the number of chocolate bars and soda cans that Kayla bought
* Theresa bought 12 chocolate bars and 18 soda cans
* Since Theresa bought twice the amount that Kayla bought, we can divide Theresa's amounts by 2 to find how many Kayla bought
* Kayla bought 12 / 2 = 6 chocolate bars
* Kayla bought 18 / 2 = 9 soda cans
* Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars and soda cans that Kayla bought is:
* 6 chocolate bars + 9 soda cans = 15 total
