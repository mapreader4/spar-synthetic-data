Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ben works 8-hour shifts
* It takes him 5 hours to build 1 rocking chair
* We need to find how many chairs he can build in 10 days

First, let's calculate how many hours Ben can work in 10 days:
* 10 days x 8 hours per day = 80 hours

Now, let's calculate how many chairs he can build in 80 hours:
* 80 hours / 5 hours per chair = 16 chairs

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 16
