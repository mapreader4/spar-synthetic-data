Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Quinton brought 40 cupcakes to school
* He gave 1 cupcake to each of the 18 students in Ms. Delmont's class
* He gave 1 cupcake to each of the 16 students in Mrs. Donnelly's class
* He gave 1 cupcake to Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal
* To calculate the total number of cupcakes given away:
    - 18 students in Ms. Delmont's class + 16 students in Mrs. Donnelly's class = 34 students
    - 4 additional cupcakes given to the teachers and staff
    - 34 students + 4 additional = 38 cupcakes given away
* To calculate the number of cupcakes left over:
    - Quinton brought 40 cupcakes
    - 40 cupcakes - 38 cupcakes given away = 2 cupcakes left over
