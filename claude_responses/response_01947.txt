Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Caleb has 3 dozen jellybeans
* 1 dozen = 12 jellybeans
* So, Caleb has 3 x 12 = 36 jellybeans

* Sophie has half as many jellybeans as Caleb
* Half of 36 is 18
* So, Sophie has 18 jellybeans

* To find the total number of jellybeans, we add Caleb's and Sophie's jellybeans:
* 36 + 18 = 54

Answer: 54
