Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sam eats 4 apples for every sandwich he eats
* He eats 10 sandwiches every day
* We want to know how many apples he eats in one week

First, let's calculate how many apples he eats in one day:
* 10 sandwiches per day x 4 apples per sandwich = 40 apples per day

Now, let's calculate how many apples he eats in one week:
* 40 apples per day x 7 days in a week = 280 apples

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 280
