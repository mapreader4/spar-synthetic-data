Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Missy watches 5 reality shows, each 28 minutes long
* So for the 5 reality shows, the total time is:
  * 5 shows x 28 minutes per show = 140 minutes
* Missy also watches one 10-minute cartoon
* To find the total time spent watching TV, we add the time for the reality shows and the cartoon:
  * 140 minutes + 10 minutes = 150 minutes

Answer: 150
