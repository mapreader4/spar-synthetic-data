Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Matt spends 80 minutes washing the outside of his car.
2) He spends 1/4 of that time cleaning the inside of the car.
3) To calculate the time spent cleaning the inside, we take 1/4 of 80 minutes:
   * 1/4 of 80 minutes = 80 / 4 = 20 minutes
4) To find the total time spent cleaning the car, we add the time spent on the outside and the time spent on the inside:
   * 80 minutes + 20 minutes = 100 minutes

Answer: 100
