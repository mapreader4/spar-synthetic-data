Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Let's say Bill makes x trips to the dump
* Jean makes x + 6 trips to the dump
* The total number of trips is 40, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 6) = 40
* Simplifying the equation:
2x + 6 = 40
* Subtracting 6 from both sides:
2x = 34
* Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 17
* Since Jean makes x + 6 trips, and x = 17, we can calculate the number of trips Jean makes:
Jean makes 17 + 6 = 23 trips.

Answer: 23
