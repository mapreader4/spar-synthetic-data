Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cory bought a patio table and 4 chairs for $135.
2) The patio table cost $55.
3) We need to find the cost of each chair.
4) To do this, we can subtract the cost of the patio table from the total cost:
$135 - $55 = $80
5) This means the total cost of the 4 chairs is $80.
6) To find the cost of each chair, we divide the total cost of the chairs by the number of chairs:
$80 / 4 = $20
Therefore, each chair cost $20.

Answer: 20
