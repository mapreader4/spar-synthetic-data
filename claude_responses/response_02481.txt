Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mr. Wong harvested 560 mangoes.
2) He sold half of the mangoes at the market, which means he sold 560 / 2 = 280 mangoes.
3) He distributed the remaining mangoes evenly among 8 of his neighbors.
4) The number of mangoes remaining after selling half is 560 - 280 = 280 mangoes.
5) To find the number of mangoes each neighbor receives, we divide the remaining 280 mangoes by 8 neighbors.
6) 280 mangoes / 8 neighbors = 35 mangoes per neighbor.

Answer: 35
