Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of a gallon of paint is $45.
2) A gallon of paint can cover up to 400 square feet.
3) The total area of the walls to be painted is 1600 square feet.
4) The walls will need a second coat, so the total area to be covered is 1600 square feet x 2 = 3200 square feet.
5) To calculate the number of gallons of paint needed, we divide the total area to be covered (3200 square feet) by the coverage per gallon (400 square feet).
6) 3200 square feet / 400 square feet per gallon = 8 gallons of paint needed.
7) The total cost of the paint is 8 gallons x $45 per gallon = $360.
8) Since Jason and Jeremy are splitting the cost, each of them will contribute half of the total cost.
9) $360 / 2 = $180.

Answer: $180.
