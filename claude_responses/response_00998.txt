Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pool holds 60 gallons of water when full
* The garden hose provides water at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute
* The pool has a leak that drains water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute
* To find the time it takes to fill the pool, we need to calculate the net rate of water flow into the pool

The net rate of water flow is the rate of water coming in (from the hose) minus the rate of water leaking out:
* Net rate of water flow = 1.6 gallons/minute - 0.1 gallons/minute = 1.5 gallons/minute

Now, to find the time it takes to fill the 60-gallon pool, we divide the pool capacity by the net rate of water flow:
* Time to fill pool = 60 gallons / 1.5 gallons/minute = 40 minutes

Answer: 40
