Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Michael currently has 4 packs of crayons.
2) He wants to buy 2 more packs of crayons.
3) Each pack of crayons costs $2.5.
4) To calculate the total worth of all the packs of crayons Michael will have after the purchase, we need to:
   a) Calculate the cost of the 2 new packs of crayons:
      2 packs x $2.5 per pack = $5
   b) Add the cost of the 2 new packs to the value of the 4 packs he already has:
      4 packs x $2.5 per pack = $10
      $10 + $5 = $15
Answer: 15
