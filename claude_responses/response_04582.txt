Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each box contains 10 cards
* Robie has 5 boxes with him
* He gave away 2 boxes to his friends
* There were 5 cards that were not placed in a box

First, let's calculate the number of cards in the 5 boxes he has with him:
* 5 boxes x 10 cards per box = 50 cards

Next, let's calculate the number of cards in the 2 boxes he gave away:
* 2 boxes x 10 cards per box = 20 cards

Finally, we add the 5 cards that were not placed in a box:
* 50 cards + 20 cards + 5 cards = 75 cards

Answer: 75
