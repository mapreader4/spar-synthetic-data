Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Felicia needs 2 cups of flour
* She needs 1 cup of white sugar
* She needs 1/4 cup of brown sugar
* She needs 1/2 cup of oil

To measure the flour, she needs to fill the 1/4 cup scoop 8 times (2 cups / 1/4 cup per scoop = 8 scoops).

To measure the white sugar, she needs to fill the 1/4 cup scoop 4 times (1 cup / 1/4 cup per scoop = 4 scoops).

To measure the brown sugar, she needs to fill the 1/4 cup scoop once (1/4 cup / 1/4 cup per scoop = 1 scoop).

To measure the oil, she needs to fill the 1/4 cup scoop 2 times (1/2 cup / 1/4 cup per scoop = 2 scoops).

In total, she needs to fill the 1/4 cup scoop 8 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 15 times.
