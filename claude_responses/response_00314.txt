Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Berry wants to read an average of 50 pages per day
* On Sunday, he read 43 pages
* On Monday, he read 65 pages
* On Tuesday, he read 28 pages
* On Wednesday, he read 0 pages
* On Thursday, he read 70 pages
* On Friday, he read 56 pages

To calculate the total number of pages he has read so far this week:
* Sunday: 43 pages
* Monday: 65 pages
* Tuesday: 28 pages
* Wednesday: 0 pages
* Thursday: 70 pages
* Friday: 56 pages
* Total pages read so far: 43 + 65 + 28 + 0 + 70 + 56 = 262 pages

Now, to calculate the average number of pages he has read per day so far:
* Total pages read: 262
* Number of days: 6 (Sunday through Friday)
* Average pages per day: 262 / 6 = 43.67 pages per day

To reach his goal of 50 pages per day, he needs to read:
* Goal pages per day: 50
* Average pages read per day so far: 43.67
* Difference: 50 - 43.67 = 6.33 pages per day

Since he has only 1 day left (Saturday), he needs to read:
* 6.33 pages on Saturday to reach his goal of 50 pages per day on average

Answer: 7 pages
