Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The farm has 100 chickens total.
2) 20% of the 100 chickens are Black Copper Marans (BCM).
3) To calculate the number of BCM chickens, we take 20% of 100:
   20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 BCM chickens.
4) 80% of the 20 BCM chickens are hens.
5) To calculate the number of BCM hens, we take 80% of 20:
   80% of 20 = 0.80 * 20 = 16 BCM hens.

Answer: 16
