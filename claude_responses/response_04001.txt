Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Liza reads 20 pages per hour
* Suzie reads 15 pages per hour
* We want to find how many more pages Liza reads than Suzie in 3 hours

First, let's calculate how many pages Liza reads in 3 hours:
* Liza reads 20 pages per hour
* In 3 hours, Liza reads 20 pages x 3 hours = 60 pages

Next, let's calculate how many pages Suzie reads in 3 hours:
* Suzie reads 15 pages per hour
* In 3 hours, Suzie reads 15 pages x 3 hours = 45 pages

Finally, to find how many more pages Liza reads than Suzie in 3 hours, we subtract Suzie's pages from Liza's pages:
* 60 pages (Liza) - 45 pages (Suzie) = 15 pages

Answer: 15
