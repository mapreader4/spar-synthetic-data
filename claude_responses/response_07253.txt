Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In the morning, there are 4 red chairs.
2) There are 2 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs, so there are 2 x 4 = 8 yellow chairs.
3) There are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs, so there are 8 - 2 = 6 blue chairs.
4) In total, there are 4 red chairs, 8 yellow chairs, and 6 blue chairs, which means there are 4 + 8 + 6 = 18 chairs in the classroom in the morning.
5) In the afternoon, Lisa borrows 3 chairs, so the number of chairs left in the classroom is 18 - 3 = 15.
