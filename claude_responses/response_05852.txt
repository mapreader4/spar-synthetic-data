Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lidia needs to buy 15 apps
2) Each app costs $4 on average
3) To calculate the total cost of the 15 apps, we multiply the number of apps (15) by the cost per app ($4):
15 apps x $4 per app = $60
4) Lidia has $66 to spend on the apps
5) To calculate how much money she will be left with, we subtract the total cost of the apps ($60) from the amount of money she has ($66):
$66 - $60 = $6
