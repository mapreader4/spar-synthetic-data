Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary ran first and took twice as long as Susan
* Susan ran second and took 10 seconds longer than Jen
* Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds
* Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary

First, let's find out how long Susan took:
* Jen finished in 30 seconds
* Susan took 10 seconds longer than Jen, so Susan took 40 seconds

Next, let's find out how long Mary took:
* Mary took twice as long as Susan, so Mary took 80 seconds

Finally, let's find out how long Tiffany took:
* Tiffany finished in 7 seconds less than Mary, so Tiffany took 73 seconds

Now we can add up the times for each runner to get the total time for the team:
* Mary: 80 seconds
* Susan: 40 seconds
* Jen: 30 seconds
* Tiffany: 73 seconds
* Total time: 80 + 40 + 30 + 73 = 223 seconds

Answer: 223 seconds
