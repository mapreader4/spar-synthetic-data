Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick
* We know that 80 pages is one inch thick
* Jack has 6 books

To find the average number of pages per book, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of pages in the stack
2. Divide the total number of pages by the number of books

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages in the stack
* The stack is 12 inches thick
* 80 pages is one inch thick
* So, the total number of pages in the stack is 12 inches x 80 pages/inch = 960 pages

Step 2: Divide the total number of pages by the number of books
* There are 6 books
* 960 pages / 6 books = 160 pages per book on average

Answer: 160
