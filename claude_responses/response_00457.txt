Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Fiona completed 36 math questions in an hour
* Shirley completed twice as many math questions as Fiona in the same time, so Shirley completed 2 * 36 = 72 math questions in an hour
* Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions, so Kiana completed (36 + 72) / 2 = 54 math questions in an hour
* If they each did the same number of questions the following hour, then in the second hour:
    - Fiona completed 36 more questions
    - Shirley completed 72 more questions
    - Kiana completed 54 more questions
* So in total, over the 2 hours:
    - Fiona completed 36 + 36 = 72 questions
    - Shirley completed 72 + 72 = 144 questions
    - Kiana completed 54 + 54 = 108 questions
* The total number of math questions completed by all three girls in 2 hours is:
    - 72 + 144 + 108 = 324 questions

Answer: 324
