Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Travis has 10000 apples.
2) Each box can hold 50 apples.
3) To find the number of boxes, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per box:
10000 apples / 50 apples per box = 200 boxes
4) Each box is sold for $35.
5) To find the total amount of money Travis will take home, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box:
200 boxes x $35 per box = $7000
Answer: $7000
