Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Ryan wants to make 5 peanut butter sandwiches.
2) Each sandwich consists of 3 slices of bread.
3) To calculate the total number of slices of bread needed, we need to multiply the number of sandwiches (5) by the number of slices of bread per sandwich (3).
4) 5 sandwiches x 3 slices of bread per sandwich = 15 slices of bread.
