Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lady Bird uses 1 1/4 cup of flour to make 9 biscuits
* She wants to make 2 biscuits per guest, and there are 18 guests
* So the total number of biscuits she needs to make is 2 biscuits per guest x 18 guests = 36 biscuits
* We know that 1 1/4 cup of flour makes 9 biscuits
* To find how many cups of flour are needed for 36 biscuits, we can set up a proportion:
* 1 1/4 cup of flour / 9 biscuits = x cups of flour / 36 biscuits
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = (1 1/4 * 36) / 9 = 5 cups of flour

Answer: 5 cups of flour
