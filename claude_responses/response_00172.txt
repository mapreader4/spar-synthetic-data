Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kyle bought 2 glass bottles that can hold 15 origami stars each.
2) The total number of stars that can be held in the 2 glass bottles is:
   2 bottles x 15 stars per bottle = 30 stars
3) Kyle then bought another 3 identical glass bottles.
4) The total number of stars that can be held in the 3 additional glass bottles is:
   3 bottles x 15 stars per bottle = 45 stars
5) To find the total number of stars Kyle must make to fill all the glass bottles, we add the number of stars from the first 2 bottles and the 3 additional bottles:
   30 stars + 45 stars = 75 stars

Answer: 75
