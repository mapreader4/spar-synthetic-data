Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories
* Each story is 10 feet
* So the total distance he needs to lower the rope is 6 stories x 10 feet/story = 60 feet
* The rope being sold is 20 feet long, but 25% of the length is lost when lashing them together
* 25% of 20 feet is 0.25 x 20 = 5 feet
* So the usable length of each rope is 20 feet - 5 feet = 15 feet
* To calculate how many pieces of rope he needs to buy, we divide the total distance of 60 feet by the usable length of 15 feet per rope
* 60 feet / 15 feet per rope = 4 pieces of rope
