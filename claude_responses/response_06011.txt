Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Mr. Gardner baked 20 cookies, 25 cupcakes, and 35 brownies.
2) The total number of sweet treats he baked is 20 + 25 + 35 = 80.
3) He has a class of 20 students.
4) To give each student an equal amount of sweet treats, we need to divide the total number of sweet treats by the number of students.
5) 80 sweet treats / 20 students = 4 sweet treats per student.

Answer: 4
