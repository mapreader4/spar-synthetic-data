Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees.
* In one hour, the temperature will decrease to 3/4 of its current temperature.
* To find the new temperature, we multiply the current temperature by 3/4:
* 84 degrees * 3/4 = 63 degrees
* To find the decrease in temperature, we subtract the new temperature from the current temperature:
* 84 degrees - 63 degrees = 21 degrees

Answer: 21 degrees
