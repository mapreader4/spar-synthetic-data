Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Manny wants 1 piece
* Aaron will not eat any lasagna, so we can exclude him
* Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat 2 pieces
* Raphael eats half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat 1/2 piece
* Lisa will eat 2 pieces, plus any of Raphael's piece that he doesn't eat, which is 1/2 piece
* So Lisa will eat 2 + 1/2 = 2.5 pieces

Now, we add up the total number of pieces needed:
* Manny: 1 piece
* Kai: 2 pieces
* Raphael: 1/2 piece
* Lisa: 2.5 pieces
* Total: 1 + 2 + 1/2 + 2.5 = 6 pieces

Therefore, Manny should cut the lasagna into 6 pieces.

Answer: 6
