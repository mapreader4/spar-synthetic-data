Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harry's birthday was three weeks after the closing of the school
* His three friends decided to contribute an equal amount of money to throw him a party
* Harry added $30 to the contribution
* The total contribution was three times as much as Harry contributed

First, let's find out how much Harry contributed. Since the total contribution was three times as much as Harry contributed, we can say that:
* Total Contribution = 3 * Harry's Contribution
* Harry's Contribution + $30 = Total Contribution
* 3 * Harry's Contribution = Harry's Contribution + $30
* 2 * Harry's Contribution = $30
* Harry's Contribution = $15

Now, we know that Harry's three friends contributed an equal amount of money. So, the total amount contributed by each of Harry's friends is:
* Total Contribution - Harry's Contribution = 3 * Amount Contributed by Each Friend
* 3 * $15 - $15 = 3 * Amount Contributed by Each Friend
* $30 = 3 * Amount Contributed by Each Friend
* Amount Contributed by Each Friend = $10

Answer: $10
