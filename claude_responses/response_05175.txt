Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total age of the people in Kaydence's family is 200 years
* Kaydence's father is 60 years old
* Kaydence's mother is 2 years younger than Kaydence's father, so she is 58 years old
* Kaydence's brother is 1/2 the age of Kaydence's father, so he is 30 years old
* Kaydence's sister is 40 years old

Now, we can add up the ages of all the family members to find Kaydence's age:
* Kaydence's father: 60 years
* Kaydence's mother: 58 years
* Kaydence's brother: 30 years
* Kaydence's sister: 40 years
* Total of the other family members: 60 + 58 + 30 + 40 = 188 years

Since the total age of the family is 200 years, and the other family members total 188 years, Kaydence must be:
* 200 years - 188 years = 12 years old

Answer: 12
