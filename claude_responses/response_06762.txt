Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 120 cats in the village.
2) One-third of all the cats in the village have spots. To find the number of spotted cats, we take one-third of 120:
   * 120 / 3 = 40 spotted cats
3) One-quarter of the spotted cats in the village are fluffy. To find the number of spotted and fluffy cats, we take one-quarter of the 40 spotted cats:
   * 40 / 4 = 10 spotted and fluffy cats

Answer: 10
