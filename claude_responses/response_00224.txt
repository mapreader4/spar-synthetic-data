Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The library cabinet houses 5 ancient scrolls.
2) The first scroll is 4080 years old.
3) Each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll's age.
4) Let's call the ages of the scrolls from oldest to youngest: 4080, x, y, z, and w.
5) We know that x = 4080 + (4080/2) = 4080 + 2040 = 6120 years old.
6) We know that y = 6120 + (6120/2) = 6120 + 3060 = 9180 years old.
7) We know that z = 9180 + (9180/2) = 9180 + 4590 = 13770 years old.
8) Therefore, the fifth scroll (w) is 13770 + (13770/2) = 13770 + 6885 = 20655 years old.

Answer: 20655
