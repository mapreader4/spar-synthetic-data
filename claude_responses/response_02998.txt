Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Katherine takes 20 hours to develop a website for her clients.
2) Naomi, Katherine's junior, takes 1/4 times more time to complete creating a similar website.
   - This means that Naomi takes 1.25 times longer than Katherine to create a website.
   - So, if Katherine takes 20 hours, Naomi takes 20 * 1.25 = 25 hours to create a website.
3) Katherine's junior, Naomi, was given 30 websites to develop.
4) To calculate the total number of hours Naomi took to create the 30 websites, we multiply the time it takes Naomi to create one website (25 hours) by the number of websites (30).
   - 25 hours per website * 30 websites = 750 hours

Answer: 750
