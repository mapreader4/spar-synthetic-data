Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beth has a total of 120 books
2) 65% of the 120 books are novels
   * 65% of 120 = 0.65 * 120 = 78 novels
3) 18 of the books are graphic novels
4) The remaining books must be comic books
   * Total books = 120
   * Novels = 78
   * Graphic novels = 18
   * Comic books = 120 - 78 - 18 = 24 comic books
5) The percentage of comic books is the number of comic books divided by the total number of books, multiplied by 100
   * Percentage of comic books = (24 / 120) * 100 = 20%

Answer: 20
