Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John takes 10 pictures every day
* He has been doing this for 3 years
* So, in 3 years, he has taken 10 pictures per day x 365 days per year x 3 years = 10,950 pictures
* Each memory card can store 50 images
* So, he needs 10,950 / 50 = 219 memory cards
* Each memory card costs $60
* Therefore, the total amount he spends on memory cards is 219 memory cards x $60 per card = $13,140

Answer: $13,140
