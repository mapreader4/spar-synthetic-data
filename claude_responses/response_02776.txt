Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jim bought a $7 lamp and a bulb which cost $4 less, so the bulb cost $3.
* He bought 2 lamps and 6 bulbs.
* The total cost of the 2 lamps would be 2 x $7 = $14.
* The total cost of the 6 bulbs would be 6 x $3 = $18.
* The total amount Jim paid is the sum of the cost of the lamps and the bulbs.
* The total amount Jim paid = $14 + $18 = $32.
