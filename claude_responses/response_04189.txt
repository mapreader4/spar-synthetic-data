Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Bernard will be 3 times as old as Luke is now in 8 years
* This means that in 8 years, Mr. Bernard's age will be 3 times Luke's current age
* Luke's current age is 20
* So in 8 years, Mr. Bernard's age will be 3 * 20 = 60
* This means that Mr. Bernard's current age is 60 - 8 = 52
* The average age of Mr. Bernard and Luke is (52 + 20) / 2 = 36
* 10 years less than their average age is 36 - 10 = 26

Answer: 26
