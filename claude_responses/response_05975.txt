Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 1 cup of dog food weighs 1/4 of a pound
* Mike has 2 dogs
* Each dog eats 6 cups of dog food twice a day
* We need to find how many 20-pound bags of dog food Mike needs to buy per month

First, let's calculate how much dog food each dog eats per day:
* 6 cups of dog food twice a day = 12 cups of dog food per day
* 12 cups of dog food x 1/4 pound per cup = 3 pounds of dog food per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the 2 dogs eat per day:
* 3 pounds per day x 2 dogs = 6 pounds of dog food per day

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the 2 dogs eat per month (assuming 30 days in a month):
* 6 pounds per day x 30 days = 180 pounds of dog food per month

Finally, let's calculate how many 20-pound bags of dog food Mike needs to buy per month:
* 180 pounds of dog food per month / 20 pounds per bag = 9 bags of dog food per month
