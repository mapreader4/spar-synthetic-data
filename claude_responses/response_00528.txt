Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. James bought 3 dirt bikes, each costing $150.
   * Total cost for the dirt bikes = 3 x $150 = $450

2. James bought 4 off-road vehicles, each costing $300.
   * Total cost for the off-road vehicles = 4 x $300 = $1,200

3. James had to pay $25 to register each of the vehicles.
   * Total cost for registration = (3 + 4) x $25 = 7 x $25 = $175

4. To calculate the total amount James paid, we add up the costs:
   * Total cost = $450 + $1,200 + $175 = $1,825

Answer: $1,825
