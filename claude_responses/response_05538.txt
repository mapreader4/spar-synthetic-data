Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The ratio of cows to bulls is 10:27. This means that for every 10 cows, there are 27 bulls.
2) We can express this ratio as a fraction: 10/37 cows and 27/37 bulls.
3) The total number of cattle on the farm is 555.
4) To find the number of bulls, we need to find the fraction of the total that represents the bulls.
5) The fraction of the total that represents the bulls is 27/37.
6) To find the number of bulls, we multiply the total (555) by the fraction 27/37.
7) 555 * (27/37) = 405
Answer: 405 bulls are on the farm.
