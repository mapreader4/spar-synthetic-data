Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jorge eats 7 croissants for breakfast
* Giuliana eats 7 croissants for breakfast
* So the total number of croissants consumed by both of them is 7 + 7 = 14 croissants
* Jorge eats 18 cakes after school
* Giuliana eats 18 cakes after school
* So the total number of cakes consumed by both of them is 18 + 18 = 36 cakes
* Jorge eats 30 pizzas before bedtime
* Giuliana eats 30 pizzas before bedtime
* So the total number of pizzas consumed by both of them is 30 + 30 = 60 pizzas
* To find the total number of croissants, cakes, and pizzas consumed, we add the totals for each:
* 14 croissants + 36 cakes + 60 pizzas = 110 items

Answer: 110
