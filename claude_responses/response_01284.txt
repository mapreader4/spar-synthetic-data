Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John takes a 10-minute shower every other day
* He does this for 4 weeks
* His shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute

First, we need to calculate the number of showers he takes in 4 weeks:
* There are 28 days in 4 weeks
* He showers every other day, so he showers 14 times in 4 weeks

Next, we need to calculate the amount of water used per shower:
* Each shower is 10 minutes long
* His shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute
* So each shower uses 10 minutes x 2 gallons/minute = 20 gallons of water

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of water used in 4 weeks:
* He takes 14 showers
* Each shower uses 20 gallons of water
* So the total water used is 14 showers x 20 gallons/shower = 280 gallons

Answer: 280 gallons
