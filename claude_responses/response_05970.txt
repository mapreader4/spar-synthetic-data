Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 30 pieces of popcorn in a serving
* Jared can eat 90 pieces of popcorn
* Jared's three other friends can each eat 60 pieces of popcorn
* To find the total number of pieces of popcorn that need to be ordered, we add up the amounts that Jared and his friends can eat:
    - Jared: 90 pieces
    - 3 friends: 3 x 60 = 180 pieces
    - Total pieces of popcorn needed: 90 + 180 = 270 pieces
* To find the number of servings that need to be ordered, we divide the total pieces of popcorn needed by the number of pieces per serving:
    - 270 pieces / 30 pieces per serving = 9 servings

Answer: 9
