Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Felix can lift 1.5 times more than he weighs.
2) Felix's brother weighs twice as much as Felix.
3) Felix's brother can lift three times his weight off the ground.
4) Felix's brother can lift 600 pounds off the ground.
5) Since Felix's brother can lift three times his weight off the ground, and he can lift 600 pounds, his weight must be 600 / 3 = 200 pounds.
6) Since Felix's brother weighs twice as much as Felix, Felix's weight must be 200 / 2 = 100 pounds.
7) Since Felix can lift 1.5 times more than he weighs, he can lift 100 * 1.5 = 150 pounds off the ground.

Answer: 150
