Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Javier has a wife and 3 children, so that's 5 people in total.
* Each person has 2 legs, so 5 people x 2 legs per person = 10 legs for the people.
* Javier's household also has 2 dogs and 1 cat.
* Dogs have 4 legs each, so 2 dogs x 4 legs per dog = 8 legs for the dogs.
* Cats have 4 legs, so 1 cat x 4 legs = 4 legs for the cat.

Adding up all the legs:
* 10 legs (people) + 8 legs (dogs) + 4 legs (cat) = 22 legs total.

Answer: 22
