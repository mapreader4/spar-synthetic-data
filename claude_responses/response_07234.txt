Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 28 dominoes in the set.
2) Jean and her three friends are playing the game, so there are 4 players in total.
3) Jean wants each player to receive the same number of dominoes.
4) To find the number of dominoes each player will receive, we need to divide the total number of dominoes (28) by the number of players (4).
5) 28 รท 4 = 7.
