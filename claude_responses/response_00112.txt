Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The family gallery has 400 photos initially.
2) On the first day of the trip, they took half as many photos as they have in the family gallery, which is 400 / 2 = 200 photos.
3) On the second day of the trip, they took 120 more photos than they took on the first day, which is 200 + 120 = 320 photos.
4) In total, they took 200 + 320 = 520 photos on the trip.
5) Adding these 520 photos to the initial 400 photos in the family gallery, the total number of photos in the gallery is 400 + 520 = 920 photos.

Answer: 920
