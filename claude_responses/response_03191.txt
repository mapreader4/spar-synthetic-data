Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Vermont opened 4 web pages on his web browser.
2. On the first web page, he found 12 ads.
3. On the second web page, he found twice as many ads as the first web page, which means 12 x 2 = 24 ads.
4. On the third web page, he found 24 more ads than the second web page, which means 24 + 24 = 48 ads.
5. On the fourth web page, he found 3/4 times as many ads as the second web page, which means 24 x 3/4 = 18 ads.
6. The total number of ads on all 4 web pages is 12 + 24 + 48 + 18 = 102 ads.
7. Vermont clicked on 2/3 of the total ads, which means 102 x 2/3 = 68 ads.

Answer: 68
