Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden.
2) Jayden has twice as many pencils as Marcus.
3) Jayden has 20 pencils.
4) Since Jayden has twice as many pencils as Marcus, we can divide Jayden's pencils by 2 to get the number of pencils Marcus has:
   Marcus has 20 / 2 = 10 pencils.
5) Since Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden, and Jayden has 20 pencils, Dana has 20 + 15 = 35 pencils.
6) The difference between the number of pencils Dana has and the number of pencils Marcus has is:
   Dana's pencils - Marcus' pencils = 35 - 10 = 25 pencils.

Answer: 25
