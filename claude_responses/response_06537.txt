Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob paid $6000 for his acorns
* Alice purchased 3600 acorns
* Alice paid nine times the price Bob paid for his acorns
* To find the price Alice paid for each acorn, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount Alice paid for her 3600 acorns
2. Divide the total amount by 3600 to get the price per acorn

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Alice paid
* Bob paid $6000 for his acorns
* Alice paid nine times the price Bob paid
* So, Alice paid 9 x $6000 = $54,000 for her 3600 acorns

Step 2: Calculate the price per acorn
* Alice paid $54,000 for 3600 acorns
* To get the price per acorn, we divide $54,000 by 3600
* $54,000 / 3600 = $15 per acorn

Answer: $15 per acorn.
