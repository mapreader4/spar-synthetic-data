Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The elevator starts on the 9th floor.
2) It then goes down 7 floors, so it is now on the 2nd floor.
3) It then goes up 3 floors, so it is now on the 5th floor.
4) It then goes up 8 floors, so it is now on the 13th floor.
5) The question states that the elevator is on the top floor, so the top floor must be the 13th floor.
Therefore, the building has 13 floors.

Answer: 13
