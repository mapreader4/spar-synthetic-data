Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are twice as many centipedes as humans on the island.
2) The number of centipedes is 100.
3) So, the number of humans is 100 / 2 = 50.
4) There are half as many sheep as humans.
5) So, the number of sheep is 50 / 2 = 25.
6) The total number of sheep and humans is 50 + 25 = 75.

Answer: 75
