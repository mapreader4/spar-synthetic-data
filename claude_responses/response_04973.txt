Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James catches 200 pounds of trout.
2) He catches 50% more pounds of salmon than trout. 50% of 200 pounds is 100 pounds, so he caught 300 pounds of salmon.
3) He catches twice as much tuna as trout. Twice as much as 200 pounds is 400 pounds of tuna.
4) To find the total pounds of fish caught, we add up the amounts of each type of fish:
   Trout: 200 pounds
   Salmon: 300 pounds
   Tuna: 400 pounds
   Total: 200 + 300 + 400 = 900 pounds

Answer: 900
