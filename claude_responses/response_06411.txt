Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* For every earring, Rebecca uses:
  - 2 magnets
  - Half as many buttons as magnets, which means 1 button per earring
  - Three times as many gemstones as buttons, which means 3 gemstones per earring
* Rebecca wants to make 4 sets of earrings
* To calculate the total number of gemstones needed:
  - Each earring requires 3 gemstones
  - Since Rebecca is making 4 sets of earrings, that's 8 earrings total (4 sets x 2 earrings per set)
  - 8 earrings x 3 gemstones per earring = 24 gemstones

Answer: 24
