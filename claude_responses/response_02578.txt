Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Harper has 15 rubber bands.
2) Harper's brother has 6 fewer rubber bands than Harper.
3) To find the number of rubber bands Harper's brother has, we subtract 6 from Harper's 15 rubber bands.
4) 15 - 6 = 9 rubber bands for Harper's brother.
5) To find the total number of rubber bands they have together, we add Harper's 15 rubber bands and his brother's 9 rubber bands.
6) 15 + 9 = 24 rubber bands.
