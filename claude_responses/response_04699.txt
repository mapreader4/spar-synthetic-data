Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carlos read 28 books in July and 30 books in August
* He needed to read 100 books during his summer vacation
* We need to calculate the number of books he read in June to meet his goal

First, let's calculate the total number of books Carlos read in July and August:
* 28 books in July + 30 books in August = 58 books

Now, we can calculate the remaining number of books he needed to read to meet his goal of 100 books:
* 100 books - 58 books = 42 books

Therefore, Carlos needed to read 42 books in June to meet his goal of 100 books during his summer vacation.

Answer: 42
