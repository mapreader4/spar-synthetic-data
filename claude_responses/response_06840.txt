Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Bob started the week with $80.
2. On Monday, he spent half of the $80, which is $40. So, he has $40 left.
3. On Tuesday, he spent one-fifth of the $40 left from Monday. One-fifth of $40 is $8. So, he has $32 left.
4. On Wednesday, he spent 3/8ths of the $32 left from Tuesday. 3/8ths of $32 is $12. So, he has $20 left.

Answer: $20
