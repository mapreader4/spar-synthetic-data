Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Chrystal's vehicle speed is 30 miles per hour.
2) Ascending the mountain decreases its speed by fifty percent, so the speed going up is 30 * (1 - 0.5) = 15 miles per hour.
3) Descending the mountain increases its speed by twenty percent, so the speed going down is 30 * (1 + 0.2) = 36 miles per hour.
4) The distance going to the top of the mountain is 60 miles.
5) The distance going down to the foot of the mountain is 72 miles.
6) To calculate the total time, we need to find the time going up and the time going down, then add them together.
7) Time going up = 60 miles / 15 miles per hour = 4 hours.
8) Time going down = 72 miles / 36 miles per hour = 2 hours.
9) Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

Answer: 6 hours.
