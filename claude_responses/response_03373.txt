Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shonda has 2 kids and 10 of their friends, so that's 12 children total
* There are also 8 adults (Shonda and the 7 other adults)
* In total, there are 12 + 8 = 20 people participating in the Easter egg hunt
* There are 15 Easter egg baskets, and each basket holds 12 Easter eggs
* So the total number of Easter eggs is 15 baskets x 12 eggs per basket = 180 eggs
* To find how many eggs each person gets, we divide the total number of eggs (180) by the total number of people (20)
* 180 eggs / 20 people = 9 eggs per person
