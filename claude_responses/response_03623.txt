Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark spends 5 minutes finding parking and 3 minutes walking into the courthouse every day.
* That's a total of 8 minutes per day for these activities.
* 2 days of the week, it takes him 30 minutes to get through the metal detector.
* The other 3 days, it takes him 10 minutes to get through the metal detector.
* So, for the 2 days it takes 30 minutes, that's 60 minutes.
* For the 3 days it takes 10 minutes, that's 30 minutes.
* Adding up all the time spent:
* 8 minutes per day x 5 days = 40 minutes
* 60 minutes (2 days) + 30 minutes (3 days) = 90 minutes
* Total time spent: 40 minutes + 90 minutes = 130 minutes

Answer: 130
