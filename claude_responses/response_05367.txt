Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kate has to fill 52 balloons
* Each balloon holds 5 gallons of air
* For the first 10 minutes, she can fill the balloons at a rate of 8 gallons of air per minute
* For the next 5 minutes, she fills them at half that rate, which is 4 gallons of air per minute
* After that, she fills the rest of the balloons at a rate of 2 gallons of air per minute

First, let's calculate how many gallons of air she can fill in the first 10 minutes:
* 8 gallons/minute x 10 minutes = 80 gallons

Next, let's calculate how many gallons of air she can fill in the next 5 minutes:
* 4 gallons/minute x 5 minutes = 20 gallons

Now, let's calculate how many balloons are left to fill after the first 15 minutes:
* 52 balloons - (80 gallons / 5 gallons per balloon) - (20 gallons / 5 gallons per balloon) = 32 balloons

Finally, let's calculate how long it will take to fill the remaining 32 balloons at a rate of 2 gallons per minute:
* 32 balloons x 5 gallons per balloon = 160 gallons
* 160 gallons / 2 gallons per minute = 80 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Kate to fill all 52 balloons is:
* 10 minutes + 5 minutes + 80 minutes = 95 minutes

Answer: 95
