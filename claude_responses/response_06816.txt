Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harry takes 15 minutes to buy coffee and a bagel
* He takes twice as long to read the paper and eat
* To find the total time for his morning routine, we need to add the time for buying coffee and a bagel, and the time for reading the paper and eating

First, we know that the time for buying coffee and a bagel is 15 minutes.

Next, we know that the time for reading the paper and eating is twice as long, which means it takes 30 minutes (2 x 15 minutes).

To find the total time for Harry's morning routine, we add the two times together:
* 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

Answer: 45
