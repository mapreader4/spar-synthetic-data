Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The sunset lasts for 2 hours, which is 120 minutes
* Every 10 minutes, the sky changes to a new color
* So, in 120 minutes, there will be 120 / 10 = 12 color changes
* Therefore, the sky turned 12 different colors over the 2-hour sunset.

Answer: 12
