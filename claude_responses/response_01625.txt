Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The original price of the movie ticket was $100
* The price is now down by 20%
* To calculate the new price, we need to find 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price
* 20% of $100 is 0.20 * $100 = $20
* Subtracting $20 from the original price of $100 gives us the new price of $80

Answer: 80
