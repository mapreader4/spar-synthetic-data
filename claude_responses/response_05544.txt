Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cooperative must ship 6500 kg of potatoes.
2) During transport, 150 kg are damaged and cannot be sold.
3) The remaining potatoes are distributed in 50 kg bags.
4) Each bag is sold for $72.

To calculate the total sale of the potatoes, we need to first find the amount of potatoes that can be sold:
* Total potatoes shipped: 6500 kg
* Potatoes damaged: 150 kg
* Potatoes available for sale: 6500 kg - 150 kg = 6350 kg

Next, we need to find how many 50 kg bags can be filled with the 6350 kg of potatoes:
* Potatoes per bag: 50 kg
* Number of bags: 6350 kg / 50 kg = 127 bags

Finally, we can calculate the total sale of the potatoes:
* Price per bag: $72
* Total sale: 127 bags x $72 per bag = $9,144

Answer: $9,144
