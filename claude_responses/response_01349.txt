To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance covered by Emerson on his trip.

Given information:
- Emerson rowed 6 miles from his starting point.
- He then continued for another 15 miles at a constant speed.
- He then covered the remaining 18 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance covered by Emerson.
Total distance covered = Distance from starting point + Distance covered at constant speed + Remaining distance
Total distance covered = 6 miles + 15 miles + 18 miles
Total distance covered = 39 miles

Therefore, the total distance covered by Emerson on his trip is:
Answer: 39 miles
