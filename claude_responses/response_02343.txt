Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerome bought 5 new toy cars last month
* This month, he bought twice as many, so he bought 10 new toy cars
* Now, he has a total of 40 toy cars

To find the number of toy cars he had originally, we can subtract the number of new cars he bought from the total number of cars he has now:
* Total cars now: 40
* Cars bought this month: 10
* Cars bought last month: 5
* Original number of cars: 40 - 10 - 5 = 25

Answer: 25
