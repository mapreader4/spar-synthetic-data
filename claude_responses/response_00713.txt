Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The boys brought 15 popsicle sticks each, and there were 10 boys.
2) So the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the boys is:
10 boys x 15 popsicle sticks each = 150 popsicle sticks
3) The girls brought 12 popsicle sticks each, and there were 12 girls.
4) So the total number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls is:
12 girls x 12 popsicle sticks each = 144 popsicle sticks
5) To find the difference, we subtract the number of popsicle sticks brought by the girls from the number brought by the boys:
150 popsicle sticks (boys) - 144 popsicle sticks (girls) = 6 popsicle sticks
