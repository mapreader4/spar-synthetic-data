Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 48 children
* Each child takes 4 sweets
* After this, there is still a third of the original amount left

First, let's calculate how many sweets were taken by the 48 children:
* 48 children x 4 sweets each = 192 sweets taken

Now, we know that the remaining amount is a third of the original amount. This means that the original amount must have been 3 times the remaining amount.

Let's call the original amount "x". We know that 2/3 of x is 192 sweets. So we can set up an equation:
* 2/3 * x = 192

Solving for x, we get:
* x = 192 * 3/2 = 288

Therefore, the original number of sweets in the pack was 288.

Answer: 288
