Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Clementine baked 72 cookies
* Jake baked twice as many cookies as Clementine, so Jake baked 72 x 2 = 144 cookies
* Tory baked half as many cookies as Jake and Clementine combined, so Tory baked (72 + 144) / 2 = 108 cookies
* In total, they baked 72 + 144 + 108 = 324 cookies
* They sell each cookie for $2
* To calculate the total money they make, we multiply the total number of cookies (324) by the price per cookie ($2)
* 324 x $2 = $648

Answer: $648
