Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days
* The first book has 200 words
* The second book has 400 words
* The third book has 300 words
* Jenny can read 100 words per hour

First, we need to find the total number of words in all 3 books:
* Total words = 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words

Next, we need to find how many hours it will take Jenny to read all 900 words:
* 900 words / 100 words per hour = 9 hours

Now, we need to convert the 9 hours into minutes:
* 9 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes

Finally, to find the average minutes per day, we divide the total minutes by the number of days:
* 540 minutes / 10 days = 54 minutes per day

Answer: 54 minutes per day.
