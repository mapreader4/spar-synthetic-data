Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were some number of people living in the town before the 100 new people moved in.
* After the 100 new people moved in, the total population of the town was the original population plus the 100 new people.
* Then, 400 of the original population moved out, so the population was the original population minus 400, plus the 100 new people.
* Every year after that, the population is halved.
* After 4 years, the population is 60 people.

Let's work backwards from the final population of 60 people:
* After 3 years, the population was 60 * 2 = 120 people.
* After 2 years, the population was 120 * 2 = 240 people.
* After 1 year, the population was 240 * 2 = 480 people.
* Before the 100 new people moved in, the original population was 480 - 100 = 380 people.

Answer: 380
