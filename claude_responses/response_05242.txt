Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Willy starts with 10 stuffed animals.
2) His mom gives him 2 more stuffed animals for his birthday.
3) So now he has 10 + 2 = 12 stuffed animals.
4) His dad then gives him 3 times more stuffed animals than he has.
5) So his dad gives him 3 * 12 = 36 more stuffed animals.
6) In total, Willy now has 12 + 36 = 48 stuffed animals.

Answer: 48
