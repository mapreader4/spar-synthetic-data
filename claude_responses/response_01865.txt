Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Linda's bag initially has:
   - 2 dimes
   - 6 quarters
   - 5 nickels

2. Her mother gives her:
   - 2 more dimes (2 + 2 = 4 dimes)
   - 10 quarters (6 + 10 = 16 quarters)
   - Twice as many nickels as she has (5 x 2 = 10 nickels)

3. Now, let's add up all the coins she has:
   - 4 dimes
   - 16 quarters
   - 10 nickels

4. To find the total number of coins, we add up all the individual coin counts:
   - 4 dimes + 16 quarters + 10 nickels = 4 + 16 + 10 = 30 coins

Answer: 30
