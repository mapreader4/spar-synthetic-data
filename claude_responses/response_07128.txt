Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Blake needs to prime and paint 5 rooms in his house
* Each room requires 1 gallon of primer and 1 gallon of paint
* The primer costs $30.00 per gallon, and there is a 20% discount
* The paint costs $25.00 per gallon, and there is no discount

First, let's calculate the cost of the primer:
* 5 rooms x 1 gallon per room = 5 gallons of primer needed
* Original price of primer: 5 gallons x $30.00 per gallon = $150.00
* Discount of 20%: $150.00 x 0.20 = $30.00
* Discounted price of primer: $150.00 - $30.00 = $120.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the paint:
* 5 rooms x 1 gallon per room = 5 gallons of paint needed
* Cost of paint: 5 gallons x $25.00 per gallon = $125.00

Finally, let's add the cost of the primer and the paint:
* Total cost = Cost of primer + Cost of paint
* Total cost = $120.00 + $125.00 = $245.00

Answer: $245
