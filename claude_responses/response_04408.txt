Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ted needs 1 loaf of bread, 2 packs of sandwich meat, and 2 packs of sliced cheese to make 10 sandwiches
* The bread costs $4.00
* The sandwich meat costs $5.00 per pack
* The cheese costs $4.00 per pack
* Ted has a $1.00 off coupon for one pack of cheese and an additional $1.00 coupon for one pack of meat
* To calculate the total cost:
    - Bread: $4.00
    - Sandwich meat: 2 x $5.00 - $1.00 = $9.00
    - Cheese: 2 x $4.00 - $1.00 = $7.00
* The total cost is $4.00 + $9.00 + $7.00 = $20.00
* Since Ted can make 10 sandwiches with these ingredients, the cost per sandwich is:
    - $20.00 / 10 = $2.00 per sandwich

Answer: $2.00
