Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael decides to use only half of his pile of matchsticks
* He creates 30 matchstick houses
* Each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks

So, we know that:
* The total number of matchsticks used = 30 houses x 10 matchsticks per house = 300 matchsticks

Since Michael used only half of his original pile of matchsticks, we can double the number of matchsticks used to find the original amount.

* Original amount of matchsticks = 300 matchsticks x 2 = 600 matchsticks

Answer: 600 matchsticks
