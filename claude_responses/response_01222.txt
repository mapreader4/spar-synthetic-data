Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

In the morning, Wendy sold:
* 40 apples at $1.50 each = $60
* 30 oranges at $1 each = $30
* Total morning sales = $60 + $30 = $90

In the afternoon, Wendy sold:
* 50 apples at $1.50 each = $75
* 40 oranges at $1 each = $40
* Total afternoon sales = $75 + $40 = $115

To calculate Wendy's total sales for the day, we add the morning and afternoon sales:
* Total sales = $90 + $115 = $205

Answer: $205
