Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill needs to soak his clothes for 4 minutes to get rid of each grass stain
* He has 3 grass stains
* So for the grass stains, he needs to soak the clothes for 4 minutes x 3 = 12 minutes
* Bill also needs to soak his clothes for 7 additional minutes to get rid of each marinara stain
* He has 1 marinara stain
* So for the marinara stain, he needs to soak the clothes for 7 minutes x 1 = 7 minutes
* To get the total time, we add the time for the grass stains and the marinara stain:
* 12 minutes + 7 minutes = 19 minutes
