Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jenny had an original amount of money
* She spent 3/7 of her original amount
* She had $24 left after spending the 3/7
* We want to find half of her original amount

First, let's find her original amount of money.
* If she had $24 left after spending 3/7 of her money, then the amount she spent was 4/7 of her original amount.
* The amount she spent is 4/7 of her original amount, and that amount is the remaining 4/7 of her original amount.
* So, her original amount is the total of the $24 she had left and the 4/7 she spent.
* Her original amount = $24 + (4/7 * original amount)
* Solving for the original amount, we get:
* Original amount = $24 / (3/7)
* Original amount = $56

Now, to find half of her original amount, we divide $56 by 2:
* Half of her original amount = $56 / 2
* Half of her original amount = $28
