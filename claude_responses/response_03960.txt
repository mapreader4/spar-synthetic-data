Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Voltaire has an average of 50 viewers per day.
2) Leila has twice the number of viewers that Voltaire has, so Leila has an average of 2 * 50 = 100 viewers per day.
3) They earn $0.50 per view.
4) To calculate Leila's earnings per week, we need to multiply her daily viewers by the earnings per view, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.
5) Leila's daily earnings = 100 viewers * $0.50 per view = $50 per day.
6) Leila's weekly earnings = $50 per day * 7 days per week = $350 per week.

Answer: 350
