Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Steve starts with $100 in his bank account.
2) The account earns 10% interest every year.
3) He puts an additional $10 into the account each year.
4) After the first year, the account balance is:
   - Initial balance: $100
   - Interest earned: 10% of $100 = $10
   - Additional deposit: $10
   - New balance: $100 + $10 + $10 = $120
5) After the second year, the account balance is:
   - Initial balance: $120
   - Interest earned: 10% of $120 = $12
   - Additional deposit: $10
   - New balance: $120 + $12 + $10 = $142

Answer: $142
