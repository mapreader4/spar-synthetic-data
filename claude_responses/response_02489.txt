Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Samara saw 20 alligators
* Samara's 3 friends each saw an average of 10 alligators
* To find the total number of alligators seen by Samara and her 3 friends, we need to add up the number of alligators seen by each person

First, let's calculate the total number of alligators seen by Samara's 3 friends:
* 3 friends x 10 alligators each = 30 alligators

Now, let's add the number of alligators seen by Samara to the number seen by her 3 friends:
* 20 alligators (Samara) + 30 alligators (3 friends) = 50 alligators

Therefore, the total number of alligators Samara and her friends saw is:

Answer: 50
