Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Turner wants to ride the rollercoaster 3 times
* Each ride on the rollercoaster costs 4 tickets
* So for the rollercoaster, he needs 3 x 4 = 12 tickets

* Turner wants to ride the Catapult 2 times
* Each ride on the Catapult costs 4 tickets
* So for the Catapult, he needs 2 x 4 = 8 tickets

* Turner wants to ride the Ferris wheel once
* Each ride on the Ferris wheel costs 1 ticket
* So for the Ferris wheel, he needs 1 ticket

* To calculate the total number of tickets Turner needs, we add up the tickets for each ride:
* 12 + 8 + 1 = 21 tickets

Answer: 21
