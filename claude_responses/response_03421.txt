Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sam has 3 German Shepherds and 4 French Bulldogs
* Peter wants to buy:
  - 3 times as many German Shepherds as Sam has
  - 2 times as many French Bulldogs as Sam has
* To calculate the number of German Shepherds Peter wants to buy:
  - Sam has 3 German Shepherds
  - Peter wants 3 times as many, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 German Shepherds
* To calculate the number of French Bulldogs Peter wants to buy:
  - Sam has 4 French Bulldogs
  - Peter wants 2 times as many, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 French Bulldogs
* To get the total number of dogs Peter wants to have, we add the German Shepherds and French Bulldogs:
  - 9 German Shepherds + 8 French Bulldogs = 17 dogs

Answer: 17
