Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mark brings in 4 times as many cans as Jaydon.
2) Jaydon brings in 5 more than twice the amount of cans that Rachel brought in.
3) There are 135 cans total.

Let's start by representing the number of cans each person brought in:
* Let's say Rachel brought in x cans.
* Then Jaydon brought in 2x + 5 cans.
* And Mark brought in 4(2x + 5) = 8x + 20 cans.

Now we can set up an equation to represent the total number of cans:
* x + (2x + 5) + (8x + 20) = 135
* 11x + 25 = 135
* 11x = 110
* x = 10

So Rachel brought in 10 cans.
Jaydon brought in 2(10) + 5 = 25 cans.
And Mark brought in 8(10) + 20 = 100 cans.

Answer: 100
