Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John uses 5 liters of fuel per km.
2) He plans to travel on two trips:
   - Trip 1: 30 km
   - Trip 2: 20 km
3) To calculate the total fuel needed for the two trips, we need to multiply the distance of each trip by the fuel usage per km.
4) For the first trip of 30 km, the fuel needed is:
   - 30 km x 5 liters/km = 150 liters
5) For the second trip of 20 km, the fuel needed is:
   - 20 km x 5 liters/km = 100 liters
6) To get the total fuel needed, we add the fuel needed for each trip:
   - 150 liters + 100 liters = 250 liters

Answer: 250 liters
