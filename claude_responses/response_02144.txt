Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sharon will be at the vacation rental for 40 days
* She has 3 cups of coffee (3 coffee pods) every morning
* That means she will use 3 coffee pods per day
* Over the course of 40 days, she will use 3 * 40 = 120 coffee pods
* Each box of coffee pods contains 30 pods and costs $8.00
* To calculate the number of boxes she needs, we divide 120 by 30:
* 120 / 30 = 4 boxes
* Each box costs $8.00, so the total cost will be 4 * $8.00 = $32.00

Answer: $32
