Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Randy has $200 in his piggy bank to start with.
* He spends $2 every time he goes to the store.
* He goes to the store 4 times per month.
* There are 12 months in a year.

So, we can calculate the total amount he spends in a year:
* $2 per trip x 4 trips per month x 12 months = $96 spent in a year.

Now, we can subtract the amount he spent from the initial $200 in his piggy bank:
* $200 - $96 = $104 remaining in his piggy bank after a year.

Answer: 104
