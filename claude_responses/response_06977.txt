Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The class has 250 students in total.
2) There are twice as many girls as boys present on that day.
3) All 140 girls were present.
4) Since there are twice as many girls as boys present, we can say that the number of boys present is half the number of girls present.
5) Therefore, the number of boys present is 140 / 2 = 70.
6) The total number of students present is 140 girls + 70 boys = 210.
7) The number of absent students is 250 - 210 = 40.
8) Since all the absent students were boys, the number of boys absent is 40.

Answer: 40
