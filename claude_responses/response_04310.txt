Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 70 students in the class yesterday.
2) 30 students are absent today.
3) The number of students present today is the total number of students yesterday (70) minus the number of students absent today (30), which is 70 - 30 = 40 students.
4) The number of students present today is 10% less than twice the number of students present yesterday.
5) Let's call the total number of students registered for the course 'x'.
6) Twice the number of students present yesterday is 2 * 70 = 140.
7) 10% less than 140 is 140 * 0.9 = 126.
8) Since the number of students present today is 126, we can set up the equation:
   x - 30 = 126
9) Solving for x, we get:
   x = 126 + 30 = 156

Answer: 156
