Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rahim is 6 years old now
* In 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now
* So, in 5 years, Andy's age will be 2 * 6 = 12 years old
* Therefore, Andy's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old
* The difference between Andy's current age (7 years) and Rahim's current age (6 years) is:
7 - 6 = 1 year

Answer: 1 year
