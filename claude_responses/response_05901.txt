Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janet needs 5 tickets to ride the roller coaster once
* She wants to ride the roller coaster 7 times
* So for the roller coaster, she needs 5 tickets x 7 times = 35 tickets
* Janet needs 3 tickets to ride the giant slide once
* She wants to ride the giant slide 4 times
* So for the giant slide, she needs 3 tickets x 4 times = 12 tickets
* To find the total number of tickets Janet needs, we add the tickets for the roller coaster and the giant slide:
* 35 tickets + 12 tickets = 47 tickets

Answer: 47
