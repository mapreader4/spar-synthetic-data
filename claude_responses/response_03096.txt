Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The temperature went up 1.5 degrees every 2 hours.
2) The temperature was 50 degrees at 3 A.M.
3) We need to find the temperature at 11 A.M.
4) The time difference between 3 A.M. and 11 A.M. is 8 hours.
5) In 8 hours, the temperature would increase by 4 times 1.5 degrees, which is 6 degrees.
6) Therefore, the temperature at 11 A.M. would be 50 degrees + 6 degrees = 56 degrees.

Answer: 56
