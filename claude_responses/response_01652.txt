Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tommy has 10 more sheets than Jimmy, so if Jimmy has 32 sheets, then Tommy has 32 + 10 = 42 sheets.
2) Ashton gives Jimmy 40 sheets, so now Jimmy has 32 + 40 = 72 sheets.
3) The difference between Jimmy's sheets (72) and Tommy's sheets (42) is 72 - 42 = 30.

Answer: 30
