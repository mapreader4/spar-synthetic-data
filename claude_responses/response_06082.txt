Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Chris has half as many cookies as Kenny. This means that if Kenny has x cookies, then Chris has x/2 cookies.
2) Glenn has four times as many cookies as Kenny. This means that if Kenny has x cookies, then Glenn has 4x cookies.
3) We are told that Glenn has 24 cookies. So, 4x = 24, which means that x = 6. 
4) If Kenny has 6 cookies, then Chris has 6/2 = 3 cookies.
5) Therefore, the total number of cookies that the three boys have is:
Kenny: 6 cookies
Chris: 3 cookies
Glenn: 24 cookies
Total: 6 + 3 + 24 = 33 cookies

Answer: 33
