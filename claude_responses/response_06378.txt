Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Grant had 20 baby teeth total
* He lost one tooth that he dropped on the way home from school, and another that he swallowed accidentally
* That means he had 18 teeth that the tooth fairy collected
* The total amount of money the tooth fairy left him was $54
* The tooth fairy left him $20 for his first tooth
* To find the amount the tooth fairy left him per tooth after the first one, we need to:
    1. Subtract the $20 for the first tooth from the total of $54
    2. Divide the remaining $34 by the 17 teeth the tooth fairy collected after the first one

Calculation:
* $54 total - $20 for first tooth = $34 remaining
* $34 / 17 teeth = $2 per tooth after the first one
