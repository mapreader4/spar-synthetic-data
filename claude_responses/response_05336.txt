Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tammy wants to run 3500 meters per week
* Her track is 50 meters around
* She wants to run the same amount each day

To find the number of loops she should make per day, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of meters she needs to run per day
2. Divide the number of meters per day by the track length (50 meters) to get the number of loops per day

Step 1: Calculate the number of meters per day
* 3500 meters per week / 7 days per week = 500 meters per day

Step 2: Divide the meters per day by the track length
* 500 meters per day / 50 meters per loop = 10 loops per day

Answer: 10 loops per day
