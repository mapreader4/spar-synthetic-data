Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The first side has 4000 soldiers, and the second side has 500 fewer soldiers than the first side.
2) The second side has 4000 - 500 = 3500 soldiers.
3) The first side needs 10 pounds of food per soldier per day.
4) The second side needs 10 - 2 = 8 pounds of food per soldier per day.
5) The total amount of food needed by the first side is 4000 * 10 = 40,000 pounds per day.
6) The total amount of food needed by the second side is 3500 * 8 = 28,000 pounds per day.
7) The total amount of food needed by both sides is 40,000 + 28,000 = 68,000 pounds per day.

Answer: 68,000
