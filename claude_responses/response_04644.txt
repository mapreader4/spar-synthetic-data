Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roman used an unknown number of gallons for his shower
* Remy used 1 more gallon than 3 times the number of gallons that Roman used
* Together, the boys used 33 gallons of water

Let's represent the number of gallons Roman used as "x".
* Remy used 3x + 1 gallons

We know that the total number of gallons used is 33, so we can set up an equation:
* x + (3x + 1) = 33

Solving this equation:
* 4x + 1 = 33
* 4x = 32
* x = 8

So, Roman used 8 gallons of water.

Now, we can calculate how many gallons Remy used:
* Remy used 3x + 1 = 3(8) + 1 = 25 gallons

Answer: 25
