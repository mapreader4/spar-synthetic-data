Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Neil baked 20 cookies.
2) He gave 2/5 of the cookies to his friend.
3) To find how many cookies he gave to his friend, we take 2/5 of the total number of cookies:
2/5 * 20 = 8 cookies
4) Now, to find how many cookies are left for Neil, we subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the total number of cookies he baked:
20 - 8 = 12 cookies

Answer: 12
