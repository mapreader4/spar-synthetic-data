Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenny has 6 Pokemon cards.
2) Orlando has 2 more cards than Jenny, so Orlando has 6 + 2 = 8 cards.
3) Richard has three times as many cards as Orlando, so Richard has 8 x 3 = 24 cards.
4) To find the total number of cards, we add up the cards of all three people:
   Jenny: 6 cards
   Orlando: 8 cards
   Richard: 24 cards
   Total: 6 + 8 + 24 = 38 cards

Answer: 38
