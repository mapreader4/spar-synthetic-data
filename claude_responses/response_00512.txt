Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Elysse can carry 3 bags of groceries per trip.
2) Her brother can also carry 3 bags of groceries per trip.
3) Together, they can carry 6 bags of groceries per trip (3 bags from Elysse + 3 bags from her brother).
4) They need to carry 30 bags of groceries in total.
5) To calculate the number of trips, we divide the total number of bags (30) by the number of bags carried per trip (6).
6) 30 bags / 6 bags per trip = 5 trips.
