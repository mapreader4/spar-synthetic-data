Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Frank has 5 apples hanging on the tree.
2) Frank also has 8 apples that have fallen to the ground.
3) Frank's dog eats 3 of the apples that have fallen to the ground.
4) To find the total number of apples left, we need to subtract the number of apples the dog ate from the total number of apples.
5) The total number of apples is 5 (on the tree) + 8 (on the ground) = 13 apples.
6) The dog ate 3 apples, so we subtract 3 from the total of 13 apples.
7) 13 apples - 3 apples = 10 apples.

Answer: 10 apples.
