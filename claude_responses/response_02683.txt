Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* On Friday, Alexandra bought 8 magazines
* On Saturday, she bought 12 more magazines
* On Sunday, she bought four times the number of magazines she did on Friday, which is 4 x 8 = 32 magazines
* Later that day, her dog chewed up 4 of the magazines

Now, let's calculate the total number of magazines she has:
* Friday: 8 magazines
* Saturday: 8 + 12 = 20 magazines
* Sunday: 20 + 32 = 52 magazines
* Minus the 4 magazines chewed up by her dog: 52 - 4 = 48 magazines

Answer: 48 magazines
