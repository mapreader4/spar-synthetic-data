Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carlotta spends 1 minute singing on stage during the final performance
* For every 1 minute of singing, she spends an additional 3 minutes practicing
* For every 1 minute of singing, she also spends an additional 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums
* The final stage performance is 6 minutes long

So, for the 6 minutes of singing on stage:
* Singing on stage: 6 minutes
* Practicing: 6 minutes x 3 = 18 minutes
* Throwing tantrums: 6 minutes x 5 = 30 minutes

Now, we add up the total time spent:
* Total time = 6 minutes (singing) + 18 minutes (practicing) + 30 minutes (throwing tantrums)
* Total time = 54 minutes
