Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Millennium runs for 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
* Alpha Epsilon is 30 minutes shorter than Millennium, so it runs for 120 - 30 = 90 minutes.
* Beast of War: Armoured Command is 10 minutes longer than Alpha Epsilon, so it runs for 90 + 10 = 100 minutes.

Answer: 100 minutes.
