Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Isabella has three times as many green houses as yellow houses. If she has 90 green houses, then she must have 30 yellow houses (90 / 3 = 30).
2) She has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. So if she has 30 yellow houses, she must have 70 red houses (30 + 40 = 70).
3) The total number of houses that are not yellow is the sum of the green houses and the red houses.
4) The number of green houses is 90, and the number of red houses is 70.
5) Therefore, the total number of houses that are not yellow is 90 + 70 = 160.

Answer: 160
