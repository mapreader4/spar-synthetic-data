Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 32 tables in the hall
* Half of the tables have 2 chairs each
* 5 tables have 3 chairs each
* The remaining tables have 4 chairs each

First, let's calculate the number of tables with 2 chairs each:
* Half of 32 tables = 16 tables
* 16 tables with 2 chairs each = 16 x 2 = 32 chairs

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs for the 5 tables with 3 chairs each:
* 5 tables with 3 chairs each = 5 x 3 = 15 chairs

Finally, let's calculate the number of chairs for the remaining tables with 4 chairs each:
* Total tables = 32
* Tables with 2 chairs = 16
* Tables with 3 chairs = 5
* Remaining tables with 4 chairs = 32 - 16 - 5 = 11 tables
* 11 tables with 4 chairs each = 11 x 4 = 44 chairs

Now, let's add up the total number of chairs:
* 32 chairs + 15 chairs + 44 chairs = 91 chairs

Answer: 91
