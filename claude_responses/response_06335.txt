Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Barry wants to make a salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes.
2) He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables.
3) There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.
4) Let's represent the number of cucumbers as x.
5) Since there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, the number of tomatoes is 3x.
6) The total number of vegetables is 280, so we can write the equation:
x + 3x = 280
7) Solving for x, we get:
4x = 280
x = 70
Therefore, the number of cucumbers used in the salad is 70.

Answer: 70
