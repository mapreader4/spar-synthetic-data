Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Stan can type 50 words per minute
2) He needs to write a 5-page paper
3) Each page will contain 400 words
4) So the total number of words he needs to write is 5 pages x 400 words/page = 2,000 words
5) At a rate of 50 words per minute, it will take him 2,000 words / 50 words/minute = 40 minutes to write the paper
6) Each hour that he types, he needs to drink 15 ounces of water
7) Since it will take him 40 minutes to write the paper, that is less than 1 hour
8) Therefore, the amount of water he needs to drink is 15 ounces

Answer: 15
