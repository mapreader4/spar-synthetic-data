Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Arman is six times older than his sister.
2) His sister was 2 years old four years ago, which means she is currently 6 years old.
3) Since Arman is six times older than his sister, his current age is 6 x 6 = 36 years old.
4) We want to know in how many years Arman's age will be 40.
5) To find this, we need to calculate the number of years it will take for Arman to go from 36 to 40 years old.
6) 40 - 36 = 4 years.
