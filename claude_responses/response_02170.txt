Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Kristine buys:
* 1 set of barrettes at $3 each
* 1 comb at $1 each
* Total for Kristine: $3 + $1 = $4

Crystal buys:
* 3 sets of barrettes at $3 each
* 1 comb at $1 each
* Total for Crystal: 3 x $3 + $1 = $10

Now, to find the total amount spent by the two girls, we add Kristine's total and Crystal's total:
* Total spent by the two girls: $4 + $10 = $14

Answer: $14
