Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The airplane can seat 10 people in first class, 30 in business class, and 50 in economy class.
* Economy class is half full, so there are 25 people in economy class.
* Business class and first class have the same number of people together as economy class, which means there are 25 people in business class and first class combined.
* Since there are only 3 people in first class, that means there are 22 people in business class.
* The total number of seats in the airplane is 10 + 30 + 50 = 90.
* The total number of occupied seats is 3 + 22 + 25 = 50.
* Therefore, the number of unoccupied seats in business class is 30 - 22 = 8.

Answer: 8
