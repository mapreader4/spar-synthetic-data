Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* For 1 regular sandwich, 2 pieces of bread are needed
* For 14 regular sandwiches, the total number of pieces of bread needed is:
    - 14 regular sandwiches x 2 pieces of bread per sandwich = 28 pieces of bread
* For 1 double meat sandwich, 3 pieces of bread are needed
* For 12 double meat sandwiches, the total number of pieces of bread needed is:
    - 12 double meat sandwiches x 3 pieces of bread per sandwich = 36 pieces of bread
* To find the total number of pieces of bread needed for both the regular and double meat sandwiches, we add the two amounts together:
    - 28 pieces of bread + 36 pieces of bread = 64 pieces of bread

Answer: 64
