Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 30 tourists
* 2 tourists were eaten by anacondas, so the remaining number of tourists is 30 - 2 = 28
* Half of the remaining 28 tourists tried to pet poisonous dart frogs and got poisoned, so the number of poisoned tourists is 28 / 2 = 14
* Of the 14 poisoned tourists, only 1/7 recovered, so the number of recovered tourists is 14 * (1/7) = 2
* Therefore, the number of tourists left at the end of the tour is the initial 30 tourists, minus the 2 eaten by anacondas, minus the 14 poisoned (excluding the 2 recovered), which is:
30 - 2 - 12 = 16

Answer: 16
