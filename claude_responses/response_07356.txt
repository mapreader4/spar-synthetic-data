Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Denmark has 3 cheese options, 4 meat options, and 5 vegetable options.
2) He can only choose one option from each category (one cheese, one meat, one vegetable).
3) If he chooses pepperoni as the meat option, he cannot choose peppers as the vegetable option.
4) To calculate the total number of topping combinations, we can multiply the number of options in each category:
* 3 cheese options x 4 meat options x 5 vegetable options = 60 total combinations
5) However, we need to subtract the combinations where pepperoni is chosen and peppers is also chosen.
6) There is 1 pepperoni option and 1 pepper option, so there is 1 combination that needs to be subtracted.
7) Therefore, the total number of topping combinations is 60 - 1 = 59.
