Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Henry drinks 15 bottles of kombucha every month.
2) Each bottle costs $3.00.
3) Each bottle is eligible for a cash refund of $0.10 when taken to a recycling center.
4) We want to find out how many bottles of kombucha he can buy after 1 year, after receiving his cash refund.

To calculate the total cash refund after 1 year:
* 15 bottles per month x 12 months = 180 bottles per year
* $0.10 cash refund per bottle x 180 bottles = $18 cash refund

Now, to calculate how many bottles of kombucha he can buy with the $18 cash refund:
* $18 cash refund / $3.00 per bottle = 6 bottles of kombucha

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 6 bottles of kombucha
