Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The tank of John's car is full, containing 47 liters of gasoline.
2) After a journey of 275 km, there are 14 liters of gasoline left.
3) To calculate the fuel consumption per 100 km, we need to find the amount of gasoline consumed during the 275 km journey.
4) The amount of gasoline consumed is the difference between the initial amount (47 liters) and the remaining amount (14 liters), which is 47 - 14 = 33 liters.
5) To find the fuel consumption per 100 km, we need to divide the amount of gasoline consumed (33 liters) by the distance traveled (275 km) and multiply by 100.
6) Fuel consumption per 100 km = (33 liters / 275 km) * 100 = 12 liters per 100 km.
