Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Walmart's multitool has:
- 1 screwdriver
- 3 knives
- 2 other tools
Total tools in Walmart's multitool = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 tools

Target's multitool has:
- 1 screwdriver
- 2 x 3 = 6 knives (twice as many as Walmart)
- 3 files
- 1 pair of scissors
Total tools in Target's multitool = 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 11 tools

To find the difference in the number of tools:
Target's multitool - Walmart's multitool = 11 - 6 = 5 more tools
