Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The office has an even number of men and women working there
* The meeting is composed of 4 men and 6 women
* This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%

To find the total number of people working in Ryan's office, we need to first find the original number of women working in the office.

Let's say the original number of women is x.
Since the office has an even number of men and women, the number of men is also x.

The meeting has 6 women, so the remaining number of women on the office floor is x - 6.
The reduction in the number of women is 20%, so:
(x - 6) / x = 0.8
Solving for x, we get:
x = 30

Therefore, the original number of women in the office is 30.
The original number of men in the office is also 30.

The total number of people working in Ryan's office is:
30 women + 30 men = 60 people

Answer: 60
