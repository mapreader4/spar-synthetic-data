Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Louise needs 60 cakes in total
* She has already produced half of this amount, which is 60 / 2 = 30 cakes
* So, she has 60 - 30 = 30 cakes left to make
* Today, she bakes half of the remaining 30 cakes, which is 30 / 2 = 15 cakes
* So, she now has 30 - 15 = 15 cakes left to make
* The next day, she bakes a third of the remaining 15 cakes, which is 15 / 3 = 5 cakes
* So, she now has 15 - 5 = 10 cakes left to make
