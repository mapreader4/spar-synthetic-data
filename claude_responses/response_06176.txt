Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 34 kids signed up to compete in the talent show.
2) We also know that there are 22 more girls than boys signed up to compete.
3) Let's represent the number of boys as x.
4) Since there are 22 more girls than boys, the number of girls can be represented as x + 22.
5) The total number of kids is 34, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 22) = 34
6) Simplifying the equation:
2x + 22 = 34
7) Solving for x:
2x = 12
x = 6
8) Since there are 22 more girls than boys, and the number of boys is 6, the number of girls is 6 + 22 = 28.

Answer: 28
