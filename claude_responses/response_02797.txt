Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Haj needs $4000 a day to run his grocery store.
2) He spends 2/5 of the total operation costs on employees' salaries.
3) The remaining amount after employees' salaries is 3/5 of the total operation costs.
4) He spends 1/4 of the remaining amount on delivery costs.
5) The remaining amount after delivery costs is 3/4 of the remaining amount, which is 9/20 of the total operation costs.
6) Therefore, the amount Mr. Haj pays for the orders done is 9/20 of the total operation costs, which is $4000.
