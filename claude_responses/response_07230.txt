Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Mitch needs 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar.
2) He has a 1/3 cup scoop, not a 1 cup scoop.
3) To get 3 cups of flour, he will need 3 cups / 1/3 cup per scoop = 9 scoops of flour.
4) To get 2 cups of sugar, he will need 2 cups / 1/3 cup per scoop = 6 scoops of sugar.
5) The total number of scoops needed is 9 scoops of flour + 6 scoops of sugar = 15 scoops.

Answer: 15
