Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Martha has 11 butterflies in total
* She has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies
* The remaining butterflies are black
* We know that Martha has 5 black butterflies

First, let's find the number of yellow butterflies. Since Martha has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies, we can say that the number of blue butterflies is 2 times the number of yellow butterflies.

Let's call the number of yellow butterflies 'x'. Then the number of blue butterflies is '2x'.

We know that the total number of butterflies is 11, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x + 5 = 11

Solving for x, we get:
3x + 5 = 11
3x = 6
x = 2

So, Martha has 2 yellow butterflies.

Now, we can find the number of blue butterflies. Since the number of blue butterflies is 2 times the number of yellow butterflies, we have:
Number of blue butterflies = 2 x 2 = 4

Therefore, Martha has 4 blue butterflies.
