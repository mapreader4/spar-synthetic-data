Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The couple agreed to split their expenses equally, including the house help's salary.
* The house help had an accident and underwent a medical procedure that cost $128.
* The couple decided to pay half of the medical expenses, which is $64.
* The other half of the medical expenses, $64, will be deducted from the house help's $160 salary.
* The husband paid for the entire half of the hospital bill, which is $64.

Now, to find out how much the husband still needs to pay so that they split the expenses for the house help equally, we need to calculate the following:
* The house help's salary after the $64 deduction is $160 - $64 = $96.
* Since the couple agreed to split the expenses equally, the husband and wife should each pay half of the house help's salary, which is $96 / 2 = $48.
* The husband has already paid $64 for the hospital bill, so he still needs to pay $48 - $64 = -$16 to the wife to split the expenses for the house help equally.

Answer: -$16
