Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Maddie watches 8 episodes of a TV show this week.
2. Each episode is about 44 minutes long.
3. On Monday, she watches 138 minutes.
4. She does not watch any TV on Tuesday and Wednesday.
5. On Thursday, she watches 21 minutes.
6. On Friday, she watches 2 episodes, which is 88 minutes (2 x 44).

Now, let's calculate the total minutes she watched during the week:
* Monday: 138 minutes
* Thursday: 21 minutes
* Friday: 88 minutes
* Total minutes watched during the week: 138 + 21 + 88 = 247 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total minutes she watched in the 8 episodes:
* 8 episodes x 44 minutes per episode = 352 minutes

The difference between the total minutes watched and the minutes in the 8 episodes is the amount of minutes she watched over the weekend:
* 352 minutes - 247 minutes = 105 minutes

Answer: 105 minutes
