Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 30 major league baseball stadiums
* Zach wants to take his son to see at least one game at each stadium
* The average cost for them to travel and see a game at each stadium is $900
* Zach can save $1,500 per year for his baseball stadium trips

To calculate the total cost of Zach's goal, we multiply the number of stadiums (30) by the average cost per stadium ($900):
* Total cost = 30 x $900 = $27,000

Now, to calculate how many years it will take Zach to save up the $27,000, we divide the total cost by the amount he can save per year:
* Years = $27,000 / $1,500 per year = 18 years

Therefore, it will take Zach 18 years to accomplish his goal.

Answer: 18
