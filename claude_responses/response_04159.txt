Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* It takes a butterfly egg 120 days to become a butterfly
* Each butterfly spends 3 times as much time as a larva as in a cocoon
* This means that the time spent as a larva is 3 times the time spent in a cocoon
* Let's call the time spent in a cocoon 'x'
* Then the time spent as a larva is 3x
* The total time from egg to butterfly is 120 days
* So the equation is: 120 = x + 3x
* Solving for x, we get: 120 = 4x
* x = 120/4 = 30

Answer: 30 days
