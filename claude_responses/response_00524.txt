Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 336 books in the library.
* On Monday, 124 books were taken out.
* So, the number of books remaining in the library after Monday is 336 - 124 = 212 books.
* On Tuesday, 22 books were brought back.
* So, the number of books in the library now is 212 + 22 = 234 books.

Answer: 234
