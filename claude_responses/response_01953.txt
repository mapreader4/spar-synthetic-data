Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The dinosaur models cost $100 each.
2) The school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library.
3) The school also bought twice as many models for the elementary library, which is 2 x 2 = 4 models.
4) In total, the school bought 2 + 4 = 6 models.
5) Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model.
6) The original price for 6 models would be 6 x $100 = $600.
7) With the 5% reduction, the new price per model is $100 - ($100 x 0.05) = $95 per model.
8) The total cost for the 6 models with the 5% reduction is 6 x $95 = $570.

Answer: $570
