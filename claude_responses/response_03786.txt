Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Patricia's current hair length is 14 inches
* She needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig
* She wants her hair to be 12 inches long after the donation

To calculate how much longer she needs to grow her hair, we need to find the total length of hair she needs before the donation, and then subtract her current hair length.

The total length of hair she needs before the donation is:
* 23 inches (for the wig) + 12 inches (for her desired length after the donation) = 35 inches

Now, we subtract her current hair length of 14 inches from the total of 35 inches:
* 35 inches - 14 inches = 21 inches

Therefore, Patricia needs to grow her hair 21 inches longer.

Answer: 21
