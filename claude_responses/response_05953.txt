Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Denise will be 25 years old in two years
* This means that Denise is currently 23 years old (25 - 2)
* Diane is 4 years younger than Denise
* So Diane is currently 19 years old (23 - 4)
* We want to know how many years it will take for Diane to be 25 years old
* To find this, we need to calculate how many years it will take for Diane to age from 19 to 25
* 25 - 19 = 6 years
* Therefore, it will take 6 years for Diane to be 25 years old.
