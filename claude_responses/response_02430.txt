Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Whitney bought 9 books about whales
2) Each book cost $11
3) So the total cost of the whale books is 9 x $11 = $99
4) Whitney also bought 7 books about fish
5) Each book cost $11
6) So the total cost of the fish books is 7 x $11 = $77
7) Whitney also bought 3 magazines
8) Each magazine cost $1
9) So the total cost of the magazines is 3 x $1 = $3
10) To calculate the total amount spent, we add up the costs of the whale books, fish books, and magazines:
$99 + $77 + $3 = $179

Answer: 179
