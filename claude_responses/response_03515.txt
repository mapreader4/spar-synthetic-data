Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Hugo can fold a small box in 3 seconds and a medium box in 6 seconds (twice the time for a small box).
2) Tom can fold a small box in 4 seconds and a medium box in 4 seconds.
3) To find the total time it will take Hugo and Tom to fold 2400 small boxes and 1800 medium boxes, we need to calculate the time for each person to fold each type of box.
4) For Hugo, it will take him 3 seconds per small box, so 2400 small boxes will take him 2400 * 3 = 7200 seconds.
5) For the medium boxes, it will take Hugo 6 seconds per box, so 1800 medium boxes will take him 1800 * 6 = 10800 seconds.
6) For Tom, it will take him 4 seconds per small box, so 2400 small boxes will take him 2400 * 4 = 9600 seconds.
7) For the medium boxes, it will take Tom 4 seconds per box, so 1800 medium boxes will take him 1800 * 4 = 7200 seconds.
8) To find the total time, we add up the times for each person and each type of box:
7200 + 10800 + 9600 + 7200 = 34800 seconds.
Answer: 34800 seconds.
