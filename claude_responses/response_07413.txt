Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Company A receives 60% of the combined profits under the new merger
* Company B receives 40% of the combined profits under the new merger
* Company B gets a total of $60,000 in profit
* To find how much Company A gets, we need to first find the total combined profits

Since Company B gets 40% of the combined profits, and they get $60,000, we can use this to find the total combined profits:
* 40% of total combined profits = $60,000
* Total combined profits = $60,000 / 0.4 = $150,000

Now that we know the total combined profits is $150,000, we can find how much Company A gets:
* Company A gets 60% of $150,000
* 60% of $150,000 = 0.6 * $150,000 = $90,000

Answer: $90,000
