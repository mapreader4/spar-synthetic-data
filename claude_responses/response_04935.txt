Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jamie's father gained 5 pounds over the holidays.
2) He burns 2,500 calories of fat a day through light exercise.
3) There are 3,500 calories in a pound of body fat.
4) He plans to eat 2,000 calories a day.
5) To lose 1 pound of body fat, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3,500 calories.
6) His daily calorie deficit is 2,500 calories (from exercise) - 1,000 calories (from eating 2,000 calories per day) = 1,500 calories.
7) To lose 5 pounds, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of 5 * 3,500 = 17,500 calories.
8) At a daily calorie deficit of 1,500 calories, it will take him 17,500 / 1,500 = 11.67 days to lose 5 pounds.

Answer: 12 days
