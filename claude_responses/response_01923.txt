Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Katrina received $5.00 for signing up for the recycling program.
* For each friend she referred, her friend received $5.00 and she received another $5.00.
* On the first day, she had 5 friends sign up.
* For those 5 friends, Katrina received 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
* Her 5 friends also each received $5.00, so that's an additional 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
* By the end of the week, she had 7 more friends sign up.
* For those 7 friends, Katrina received 7 x $5.00 = $35.00.
* Her 7 friends also each received $5.00, so that's an additional 7 x $5.00 = $35.00.
* In total:
  - Katrina received $5.00 for signing up + $25.00 for the first 5 friends + $35.00 for the additional 7 friends = $65.00.
  - Her 12 friends (5 + 7) each received $5.00, so that's 12 x $5.00 = $60.00.
