Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 40 rows of chairs set up
* Each row had 20 chairs
* So the total number of chairs set up is 40 rows x 20 chairs per row = 800 chairs
* It is stated that only 10 seats were not occupied
* Therefore, the number of seats that were taken is the total number of chairs (800) minus the number of seats not occupied (10)
* 800 - 10 = 790

Answer: 790
