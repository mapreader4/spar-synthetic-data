Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The initial price of a monster box of cereal is $104.
2) The price is reduced by $24 due to an oversupply in the market.
3) Therefore, the new price of a monster box of cereal is $104 - $24 = $80.
4) Romina bought 20 of these boxes.
5) To calculate the total price Romina paid, we multiply the new price of each box ($80) by the number of boxes she bought (20).
6) $80 x 20 = $1,600.

Answer: 1,600
