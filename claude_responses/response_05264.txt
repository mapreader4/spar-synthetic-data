Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day for 6 days
* That means she bakes 4 cakes per day
* So over the 6 days, she bakes a total of 4 x 6 = 24 cakes
* However, every other day, Clifford eats one of Julia's cakes
* That means Clifford eats a total of 3 cakes (one on days 2, 4, and 6)
* So the total number of cakes Julia has remaining is 24 - 3 = 21 cakes

Answer: 21
