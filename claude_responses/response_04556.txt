Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The 6th grade read a total of 299 hours.
2) The 5th grade has 20 students and one week to read as much as possible.
3) To beat the 6th grade by 1 hour, the 5th grade needs to read a total of 300 hours.
4) To find the average hours per day each 5th grade student needs to read, we divide the total hours needed (300) by the number of students (20) and the number of days in a week (7).
5) 300 hours / (20 students * 7 days) = 2.14 hours per day per student.
