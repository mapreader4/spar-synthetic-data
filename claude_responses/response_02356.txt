Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples.
2) The total cost of the oranges was $12.
3) The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges.
4) To find the cost of 1 kg of apples, we need to first find the cost of 1 kg of oranges.
5) Since the total cost of the oranges was $12, and Betty bought 1 kg of oranges, the cost of 1 kg of oranges is $12.
6) Since the apples were two times cheaper than the oranges, the cost of 1 kg of apples is half the cost of 1 kg of oranges.
7) Therefore, the cost of 1 kg of apples is $12 / 2 = $6.

Answer: $6
