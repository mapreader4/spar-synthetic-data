Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Apple sold 100 iPhones at an average cost of $1000 each.
2) They also sold 20 iPads at an average cost of $900 each.
3) They also sold 80 Apple TVs at an average cost of $200 each.
4) To calculate the average cost across all products sold, we need to find the total revenue and divide it by the total number of products sold.
5) Total revenue from iPhones: 100 * $1000 = $100,000
6) Total revenue from iPads: 20 * $900 = $18,000
7) Total revenue from Apple TVs: 80 * $200 = $16,000
8) Total revenue across all products: $100,000 + $18,000 + $16,000 = $134,000
9) Total number of products sold: 100 + 20 + 80 = 200
10) Average cost across all products: $134,000 / 200 = $670

Answer: 670
