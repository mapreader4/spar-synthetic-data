Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark spent a total of $220 to fix his car
* The car needed two parts that cost $20 each, so the total cost of the parts was $40
* The remaining cost was for labor, which was $0.50 per minute
* To find the total labor cost, we need to subtract the cost of the parts from the total cost: $220 - $40 = $180
* Since the labor cost is $0.50 per minute, we can divide the total labor cost by $0.50 to find the total number of minutes the mechanic worked:
$180 / $0.50 = 360 minutes
* To convert the minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60:
360 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
