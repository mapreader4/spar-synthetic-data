Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Biology class has three times as many girls as boys.
2) The Physics class has 200 students.
3) The Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class.

First, let's find the total number of students in the Biology class:
* The Physics class has 200 students.
* The Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class.
* Therefore, the Biology class has 200 / 2 = 100 students.

Now, let's find the number of boys in the Biology class:
* The Biology class has three times as many girls as boys.
* Let's say there are x boys in the Biology class.
* Then there are 3x girls in the Biology class.
* The total number of students in the Biology class is 100.
* So x + 3x = 100
* 4x = 100
* x = 25

Therefore, the number of boys in the Biology class is 25.

Answer: 25
