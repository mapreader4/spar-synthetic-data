Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael has 2 cats and 3 dogs
* The friend charges $13 per animal per night
* To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of animals by the cost per animal per night
* The total number of animals is 2 cats + 3 dogs = 5 animals
* The cost per animal per night is $13
* Therefore, the total cost is 5 animals x $13 per animal = $65

Answer: $65
