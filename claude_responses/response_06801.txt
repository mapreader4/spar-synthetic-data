Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* We know that 36 liters of diesel fuel is worth €18.
* This means that the cost per liter of diesel fuel is:
    * €18 / 36 liters = €0.50 per liter
* The tank of the pickup truck can hold 64 liters.
* To calculate the cost of a full tank of diesel fuel, we multiply the cost per liter by the tank capacity:
    * €0.50 per liter x 64 liters = €32

Answer: €32
