Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A carton contains 12 boxes
* Each box has 10 packs of cheese cookies
* So, each carton contains 12 boxes x 10 packs per box = 120 packs of cheese cookies
* A dozen (12) cartons cost $1440
* To find the price of a single pack of cheese cookies, we need to divide the total cost ($1440) by the total number of packs (12 cartons x 120 packs per carton = 1440 packs)
* $1440 / 1440 packs = $1 per pack
