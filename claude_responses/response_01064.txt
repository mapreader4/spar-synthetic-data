Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harry owns 3 geckos, 2 iguanas, and 4 snakes
* He spends $15 to feed each gecko every month
* He spends $5 to feed each iguana every month
* He spends $10 to feed each snake every month

To calculate the total monthly cost:
* Cost for geckos: 3 geckos x $15 per gecko = $45
* Cost for iguanas: 2 iguanas x $5 per iguana = $10
* Cost for snakes: 4 snakes x $10 per snake = $40
* Total monthly cost = $45 + $10 + $40 = $95

To calculate the total yearly cost:
* Total monthly cost = $95
* Total yearly cost = $95 x 12 months = $1,140

Answer: $1,140
