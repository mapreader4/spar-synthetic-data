Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rollo has 3 guinea pigs
2) The first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food
3) The second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, which is 2 x 2 = 4 cups of food
4) The third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one, which is 4 + 3 = 7 cups of food
5) To find the total amount of food needed, we add up the amounts for each guinea pig:
2 cups + 4 cups + 7 cups = 13 cups of food

Answer: 13
