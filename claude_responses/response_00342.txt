Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The soccer game was 90 minutes long
* Mark played for 20 minutes initially
* Then he rested for some time
* He then played for another 35 minutes
* To find how long he was on the sideline, we need to subtract the total time he played from the total game time

First, let's calculate the total time Mark played:
* 20 minutes + 35 minutes = 55 minutes

Now, we can subtract the total time he played from the total game time to find how long he was on the sideline:
* 90 minutes - 55 minutes = 35 minutes

Answer: 35
