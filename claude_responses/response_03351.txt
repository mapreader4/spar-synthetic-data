Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The distance to the church is 20 miles.
2) The horse can go 10 miles per hour.
3) The cost is $30 per hour plus a flat fee of $20.
4) To calculate the time it takes to travel the 20 miles:
   - Distance = 20 miles
   - Speed = 10 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 20 miles / 10 miles per hour = 2 hours
5) The total cost is:
   - Hourly rate: 2 hours x $30 per hour = $60
   - Flat fee: $20
   - Total cost = $60 + $20 = $80

Answer: $80
