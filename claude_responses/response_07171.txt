Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The crayon factory makes 4 colors of crayons
* They put 2 of each color crayon in each box
* So each box contains 4 crayons (2 of each color)
* The factory produces enough crayons to fill 5 boxes per hour
* We want to find how many crayons the factory produces in 4 hours

First, let's calculate how many crayons are produced in 1 hour:
* 5 boxes per hour x 4 crayons per box = 20 crayons per hour

Now, to find the total number of crayons produced in 4 hours:
* 20 crayons per hour x 4 hours = 80 crayons

Answer: 80
