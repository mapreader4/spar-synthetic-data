Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tye withdraws $300 from each of the two banks.
2) The total amount of money Tye withdraws is $300 + $300 = $600.
3) The bills Tye receives are all $20 bills.
4) To find the number of $20 bills, we divide the total amount ($600) by the value of each bill ($20).
5) $600 / $20 = 30 bills.

Answer: 30
