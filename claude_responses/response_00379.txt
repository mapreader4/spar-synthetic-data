Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys a piano for $500.
2) He hires a teacher for 20 lessons at $40 per lesson.
3) He gets a 25% discount on the lessons.

To calculate the cost of the lessons:
* 20 lessons at $40 per lesson = $800
* With a 25% discount, the cost of the lessons is $800 - (25% of $800) = $800 - $200 = $600

Now, to calculate the total cost:
* Cost of the piano: $500
* Cost of the lessons: $600
* Total cost: $500 + $600 = $1,100

Answer: $1,100
