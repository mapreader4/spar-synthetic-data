Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Lisa bought 12 pairs of socks at a discount store
* Sandra brought 20 pairs of socks
* Lisa's cousin brought one-fifth the number of pairs that Sandra bought
* Lisa's mom brought 8 more than three times the number of pairs Lisa started with

First, let's calculate the number of pairs Lisa's cousin brought:
* Sandra brought 20 pairs
* One-fifth of 20 is 4
* So, Lisa's cousin brought 4 pairs of socks

Next, let's calculate the number of pairs Lisa's mom brought:
* Lisa started with 12 pairs
* Three times 12 is 36
* 8 more than 36 is 44
* So, Lisa's mom brought 44 pairs of socks

Now, let's add up all the pairs of socks:
* Lisa bought 12 pairs
* Sandra brought 20 pairs
* Lisa's cousin brought 4 pairs
* Lisa's mom brought 44 pairs
* 12 + 20 + 4 + 44 = 80 pairs

Answer: 80 pairs of socks
