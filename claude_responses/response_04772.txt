Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dogs have 42 teeth each, and Vann is doing 5 dogs. So for the dogs, the total number of teeth is:
   5 dogs x 42 teeth per dog = 210 teeth
2) Cats have 30 teeth each, and Vann is doing 10 cats. So for the cats, the total number of teeth is:
   10 cats x 30 teeth per cat = 300 teeth
3) Pigs have 28 teeth each, and Vann is doing 7 pigs. So for the pigs, the total number of teeth is:
   7 pigs x 28 teeth per pig = 196 teeth
4) To get the total number of teeth Vann will clean, we add up the teeth for the dogs, cats, and pigs:
   210 + 300 + 196 = 706 teeth

Answer: 706
