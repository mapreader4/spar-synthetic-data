Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The bag of sugar weighs 16 kg.
2) The bag of salt weighs 30 kg.
3) The combined weight of the two bags is 16 kg + 30 kg = 46 kg.
4) You remove 4 kg from the combined weight of the two bags.
5) The new combined weight of the two bags is 46 kg - 4 kg = 42 kg.

Answer: 42 kg
