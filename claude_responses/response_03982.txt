Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Niraj contributed $80
* Brittany's contribution is triple Niraj's contribution
* Brittany's contribution = 3 x $80 = $240
* Angela's contribution is triple Brittany's contribution
* Angela's contribution = 3 x $240 = $720
* To find the total contribution, we add up the individual contributions:
* Total contribution = Niraj's contribution + Brittany's contribution + Angela's contribution
* Total contribution = $80 + $240 + $720 = $1,040

Answer: $1,040
