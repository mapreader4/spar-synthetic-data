Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's initial Clean & Jerk capacity: 80 kg
2. John's initial Snatch capacity: 50 kg
3. John doubles his Clean & Jerk capacity:
   - New Clean & Jerk capacity = 80 kg x 2 = 160 kg
4. John increases his Snatch capacity by 80%:
   - New Snatch capacity = 50 kg + (50 kg x 0.8) = 50 kg + 40 kg = 90 kg
5. To calculate his new combined total lifting capacity, we add his new Clean & Jerk and Snatch capacities:
   - New combined total = 160 kg + 90 kg = 250 kg

Answer: 250
