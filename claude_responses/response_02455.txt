Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each student needs 1 bow, 1 bottle of vinegar, and 1 box of baking soda
* Bows cost $5 each
* Bottles of vinegar cost $2 each
* Boxes of baking soda cost $1 each
* The teacher has 23 students in the class

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the bows for all 23 students
   * 23 students x $5 per bow = $115
2. Calculate the cost of the bottles of vinegar for all 23 students
   * 23 students x $2 per bottle = $46
3. Calculate the cost of the boxes of baking soda for all 23 students
   * 23 students x $1 per box = $23
4. Add up the costs of the bows, vinegar, and baking soda
   * $115 + $46 + $23 = $184

Answer: $184
