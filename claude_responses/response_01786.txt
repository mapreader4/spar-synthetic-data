Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 4/5 of the Easter eggs are blue
* 1/5 of the Easter eggs are purple
* Half of the purple eggs have 5 pieces of candy each
* 1/4 of the blue eggs have 5 pieces of candy each
* The rest of the eggs only have 1 piece of candy

First, let's calculate the number of purple eggs with 5 pieces of candy:
* 1/5 of the eggs are purple
* Half of the purple eggs have 5 pieces of candy
* So, 1/2 * 1/5 = 1/10 of the eggs have 5 pieces of candy

Next, let's calculate the number of blue eggs with 5 pieces of candy:
* 4/5 of the eggs are blue
* 1/4 of the blue eggs have 5 pieces of candy
* So, 1/4 * 4/5 = 1/5 of the eggs have 5 pieces of candy

Now, the total percentage of eggs with 5 pieces of candy is:
* 1/10 + 1/5 = 3/10 = 30%

Answer: 30%
