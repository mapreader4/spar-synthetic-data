Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John worked 8 hours a day
* He worked from the 3rd to the 8th, including the 3rd and not including the 8th
* That means he worked for 6 days (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th)
* Since he worked 8 hours a day for 6 days, we can calculate the total hours worked as:
* 8 hours per day x 6 days = 48 hours

Answer: 48
