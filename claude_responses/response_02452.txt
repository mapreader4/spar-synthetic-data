Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Let's call the number of birds on the fence as 'x'.
2) The question states that "Ten more than twice the number of birds on the fence is 50".
3) Mathematically, this can be expressed as: 2x + 10 = 50
4) Subtracting 10 from both sides: 2x = 40
5) Dividing both sides by 2: x = 20
Therefore, the number of birds on the fence is 20.

Answer: 20
