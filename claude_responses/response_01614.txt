To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time difference between taking route A and route B for the round trip to Boston.

Given information:
- Route A takes 5 hours to arrive at Boston.
- Route B takes 2 hours to arrive at Boston.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to go to Boston and back using route A.
Time to go to Boston and back using route A = 2 × 5 hours = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to go to Boston and back using route B.
Time to go to Boston and back using route B = 2 × 2 hours = 4 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time saved by taking route B instead of route A.
Time saved = Time taken by route A - Time taken by route B
Time saved = 10 hours - 4 hours = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
