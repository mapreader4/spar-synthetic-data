Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Trey has 7 things to do to clean the house
* Trey has 1 thing to do to take a shower
* Trey has 4 things to do to make dinner
* In total, Trey has 7 + 1 + 4 = 12 things to do
* Each item on the list takes 10 minutes to do
* To calculate the total time, we multiply the number of items (12) by the time per item (10 minutes)
* 12 items x 10 minutes per item = 120 minutes total
* To convert this to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60 minutes per hour
* 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
