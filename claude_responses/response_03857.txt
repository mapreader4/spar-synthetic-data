Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The quarterback steps back to throw 80 times in the game.
2) 30% of the time, he does not get a pass thrown.
3) 30% of 80 is 24, so he does not get a pass thrown 24 times.
4) Half of the times that he does not throw the ball, he is sacked for a loss.
5) Half of 24 is 12, so he is sacked for a loss 12 times.

Answer: 12
