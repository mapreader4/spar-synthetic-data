Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cornelia has visited a total of 42 different countries
* 20 of those countries were in Europe
* 10 of those countries were in South America
* The remaining countries are not in Europe or South America
* We know that half of the remaining countries are in Asia
* To find the number of Asian countries, we need to first find the number of remaining countries, and then divide that by 2

First, let's find the number of remaining countries:
* Total countries visited: 42
* Countries in Europe: 20
* Countries in South America: 10
* Remaining countries = 42 - 20 - 10 = 12

Now, we know that half of the remaining 12 countries are in Asia, so:
* Asian countries = 12 / 2 = 6
