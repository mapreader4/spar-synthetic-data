Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mike's annual salary is $150,000.
2) He puts away 10% of his salary, which is 0.10 * $150,000 = $15,000 per year.
3) The cost of the house is $450,000.
4) He needs to save 20% of the cost of the house for the downpayment, which is 0.20 * $450,000 = $90,000.
5) To calculate how long it will take him to save the $90,000 downpayment, we divide $90,000 by the amount he saves each year ($15,000).
6) $90,000 / $15,000 = 6 years.
