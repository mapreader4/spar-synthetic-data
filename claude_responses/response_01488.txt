Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bella has 10 earrings, which is 25% of Monica's earrings.
2) To find how many earrings Monica has, we can use the following equation:
   Bella's earrings = 25% of Monica's earrings
   10 = 0.25 * Monica's earrings
   Monica's earrings = 10 / 0.25 = 40 earrings
3) Monica has twice as many earrings as Rachel.
   Monica's earrings = 40
   Rachel's earrings = 40 / 2 = 20 earrings
4) To find the total number of earrings all the friends have, we add up their individual earrings:
   Bella's earrings = 10
   Monica's earrings = 40
   Rachel's earrings = 20
   Total earrings = 10 + 40 + 20 = 70

Answer: 70
