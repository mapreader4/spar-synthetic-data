Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Half of Jerome's money was $43. This means that Jerome's total money was $43 x 2 = $86.
2) Jerome gave $8 to Meg.
3) Jerome gave thrice as much to Bianca, which is $8 x 3 = $24.
4) The total amount Jerome gave away is $8 + $24 = $32.
5) To find how much Jerome has left, we take his total money ($86) and subtract the amount he gave away ($32).
6) $86 - $32 = $54.

Answer: $54.
