Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, 300 messages were sent.
2. On Tuesday, 200 messages were sent.
3. On Wednesday, the number of messages sent was 300 more than the previous day, which was Tuesday. So, on Wednesday, 200 + 300 = 500 messages were sent.
4. On Thursday, the number of messages sent was two times as many as there were on Wednesday. So, on Thursday, 500 x 2 = 1,000 messages were sent.

Now, to calculate the total number of messages sent in the Whatsapp group after the four days, we add up the messages sent on each day:
300 + 200 + 500 + 1,000 = 2,000

Answer: 2,000
