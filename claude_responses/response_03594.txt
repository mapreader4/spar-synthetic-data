Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Solomon paid $450 for the dining table after a 10% discount.
2) To find the original price, we need to work backwards from the sale price.
3) The discount amount is 10% of the original price.
4) To find the original price, we need to add the discount amount to the sale price.
5) The discount amount is 10% of the original price, which means it is 0.10 times the original price.
6) So, the original price = $450 / (1 - 0.10) = $450 / 0.90 = $500.
Answer: 500
