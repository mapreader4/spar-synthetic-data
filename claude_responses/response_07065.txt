Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Juan saw 15 cars
* Each car has 4 tires
* So for the 15 cars, the total number of tires is 15 * 4 = 60 tires

* Juan saw 3 bicycles
* Each bicycle has 2 tires
* So for the 3 bicycles, the total number of tires is 3 * 2 = 6 tires

* Juan saw 8 pickup trucks
* Each pickup truck has 4 tires
* So for the 8 pickup trucks, the total number of tires is 8 * 4 = 32 tires

* Juan saw 1 tricycle
* Each tricycle has 3 tires
* So for the 1 tricycle, the total number of tires is 1 * 3 = 3 tires

Now, to find the total number of tires, we add up the tires from each type of vehicle:
60 tires (cars) + 6 tires (bicycles) + 32 tires (pickup trucks) + 3 tires (tricycle) = 101 tires

Answer: 101
