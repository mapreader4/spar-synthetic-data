Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) CJ has 5 more than twice the number of stamps that KJ has. So, if KJ has x stamps, then CJ has 2x + 5 stamps.
2) KJ has half as many stamps as AJ. So, if AJ has y stamps, then KJ has y/2 stamps.
3) The total number of stamps the three boys have is 930. So, we can write the equation:
   CJ + KJ + AJ = 930
   (2x + 5) + (y/2) + y = 930
4) Simplifying the equation, we get:
   2x + 5 + y/2 + y = 930
   2x + 1.5y + 5 = 930
5) We also know that KJ has half as many stamps as AJ, so y = 2x.
6) Substituting y = 2x into the equation, we get:
   2x + 1.5(2x) + 5 = 930
   2x + 3x + 5 = 930
   5x + 5 = 930
   5x = 925
   x = 185
7) Since KJ has y/2 stamps, and y = 2x, we can calculate that KJ has 185 stamps.
8) Since CJ has 2x + 5 stamps, we can calculate that CJ has 375 stamps.
9) Finally, since AJ has y stamps, and y = 2x, we can calculate that AJ has 370 stamps.

Answer: 370
