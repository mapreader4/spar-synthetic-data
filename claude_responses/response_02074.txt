Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Samanta invited 12 guests to the party
* Each guest contributed $5 towards the gift
* Samanta herself contributed $10
* So the total amount of money raised was:
    - 12 guests x $5 each = $60
    - Plus Samanta's $10 contribution = $60 + $10 = $70
* The gift cost was lower than expected, and there was $15 leftover
* To find the price of the gift, we take the total amount raised ($70) and subtract the leftover amount ($15)
* $70 - $15 = $55

Answer: $55
