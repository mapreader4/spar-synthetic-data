Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that half the alligators are male, and the other half are female.
2) Among the female alligators, 40% are juveniles. This means 60% are adults.
3) We are told that there are 15 adult female alligators.
4) To find the total number of female alligators, we can divide the number of adult females (15) by the percentage of adult females (60%):
   Total female alligators = 15 / 0.6 = 25
5) Since half the alligators are male, the number of male alligators is also 25.

Answer: 25
