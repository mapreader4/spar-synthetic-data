Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lillian has 3 cups of sugar at home
* She buys 2 bags of sugar, and each bag contains 6 cups
* So the total amount of sugar she has is:
    - 3 cups from home
    - 2 bags x 6 cups per bag = 12 cups from the store
    - Total = 3 + 12 = 15 cups of sugar
* The batter uses 1 cup of sugar per 12 cupcakes
* She needs 2 cups of sugar to make enough frosting for a dozen cupcakes
* So the total sugar needed per dozen cupcakes is 1 + 2 = 3 cups
* Therefore, the maximum number of dozen cupcakes she can bake and ice is:
    - Total sugar available / Sugar needed per dozen cupcakes
    - 15 cups / 3 cups per dozen = 5 dozen cupcakes
