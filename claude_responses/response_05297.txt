Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The soccer team has 24 players
* They have scored a total of 150 goals on the season
* There have been 15 games played
* 1/3 of the players (24 * 1/3 = 8 players) have averaged 1 goal each per game
* To calculate the total goals scored by the 1/3 of players:
    - 8 players x 1 goal per game x 15 games = 120 goals
* To calculate the total goals scored by the other 2/3 of players:
    - Total goals scored = 150
    - Goals scored by 1/3 of players = 120
    - Goals scored by the other 2/3 of players = 150 - 120 = 30 goals

Answer: 30
