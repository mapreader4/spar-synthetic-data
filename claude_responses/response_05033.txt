Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ray walks 4 blocks to the park.
2) Then he walks 7 blocks to the high school.
3) Finally, he walks 11 blocks to get back home.
4) This is a total of 4 + 7 + 11 = 22 blocks per walk.
5) Ray walks his dog 3 times each day.
6) Therefore, the total number of blocks the dog walks each day is 3 * 22 = 66 blocks.

Answer: 66
