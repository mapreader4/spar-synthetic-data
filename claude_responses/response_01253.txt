Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Danai puts 12 plastic skulls around the house
* She has 4 broomsticks, 1 for each side of the front and back doors
* She puts up 12 spiderwebs around the house
* She puts twice as many pumpkins as spiderwebs, so that's 2 x 12 = 24 pumpkins
* She also places a large cauldron on the dining room table

Now, let's add up all the decorations she has put up so far:
* 12 plastic skulls
* 4 broomsticks
* 12 spiderwebs
* 24 pumpkins
* 1 cauldron
* Total: 12 + 4 + 12 + 24 + 1 = 53 decorations

Danai has a budget left to buy 20 more decorations, and she has 10 left to put up.
* Total decorations she will put up = 53 + 10 = 63

Answer: 63
