Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total cost of the meal is the sum of the individual orders:
   * Julie's order: $10
   * Letitia's order: $20
   * Anton's order: $30
   * Total cost of the meal: $10 + $20 + $30 = $60
2) The tip is 20% of the total cost of the meal:
   * Tip amount: 20% of $60 = 0.20 * $60 = $12
3) To split the tip evenly, each person should pay 1/3 of the total tip amount:
   * Tip amount per person: $12 / 3 = $4

Answer: $4
