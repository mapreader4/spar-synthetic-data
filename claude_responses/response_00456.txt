Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Chad earned/received the following amounts:
   - $600 from mowing yards
   - $250 for his birthday/holidays
   - $150 from selling old video games
   - $150 from doing odd jobs
2) Adding up all of these amounts, we get:
   - $600 + $250 + $150 + $150 = $1,150
3) Chad saves 40% of the money he earns/receives.
4) To calculate the amount he will save, we take 40% of the total amount he earned/received:
   - 40% of $1,150 = 0.4 * $1,150 = $460

Answer: $460
