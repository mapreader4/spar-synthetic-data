Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, Sydney collects 4 rocks and Conner collects 8 times as many, which is 4 x 8 = 32 rocks.
2. On the second day, Sydney rests and Conner collects 123 rocks.
3. On the third day, Sydney collects twice as many as Conner did on the first day, which is 2 x 32 = 64 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the total number of rocks each person has:
* Sydney: 837 + 4 + 64 = 905 rocks
* Conner: 723 + 32 + 123 = 878 rocks

To tie Sydney, Conner needs to collect at least 27 more rocks on the third day.

Answer: 27
