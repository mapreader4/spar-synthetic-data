Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The cost of hiring the actors is $1200.
2. The cost of food for the 50 people is $3 per person, which is 50 * $3 = $150.
3. The total cost of actors and food is $1200 + $150 = $1350.
4. The equipment rental cost is twice as much as the cost of actors and food, which is 2 * $1350 = $2700.
5. The total cost of the movie production is the sum of the actors, food, and equipment rental, which is $1350 + $2700 = $4050.
6. The movie was sold for $10,000.
7. The profit is the difference between the sale price and the total cost of production, which is $10,000 - $4050 = $5950.

Answer: $5950
