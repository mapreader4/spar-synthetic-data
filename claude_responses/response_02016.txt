Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Vikki worked 42 hours in one week
2) Her hourly pay rate is $10
3) To calculate her weekly earnings, we multiply her hours worked (42) by her hourly pay rate ($10):
   42 hours x $10 per hour = $420 weekly earnings
4) From her weekly earnings, 20% is deducted as tax:
   $420 x 0.20 = $84 tax deduction
5) 5% is deducted as insurance cover:
   $420 x 0.05 = $21 insurance deduction
6) $5 is deducted for union dues
7) To calculate the amount Vikki takes home after deductions, we subtract the deductions from her weekly earnings:
   $420 - $84 (tax) - $21 (insurance) - $5 (union dues) = $310

Answer: $310
