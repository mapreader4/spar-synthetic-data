Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alex needs to be 54 inches tall to ride the roller coaster
* He is currently 48 inches tall
* He needs to grow 54 - 48 = 6 inches to be tall enough
* He normally grows 1/3 of an inch per month
* So in a year (12 months), he would normally grow 12 * 1/3 = 4 inches
* However, he can also grow 1/12 of an inch for every hour he hangs upside down
* To grow the remaining 2 inches (6 inches needed - 4 inches normal growth), he would need to hang upside down for:
* 2 inches / (1/12 inch per hour) = 24 hours

Therefore, on average, Alex needs to hang upside down for 24 hours each month to be tall enough next year to ride the roller coaster.

Answer: 24
