Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Marlon has a gift card for $200.
2) On Monday, he spent half of the $200, which is $100.
3) The remaining amount on the gift card is $200 - $100 = $100.
4) On Tuesday, he spent one-fourth of the remaining $100, which is $25.
5) The remaining amount on the gift card is $100 - $25 = $75.
