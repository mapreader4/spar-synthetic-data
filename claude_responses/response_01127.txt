Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 20% of the items are useful
* 10% of the items are valuable heirlooms
* 70% of the items are junk
* We know that there are 8 useful items in the attic
* To find the total number of items in the attic, we can use the 20% useful items as a reference:
* If 20% of the items are useful, and there are 8 useful items, then the total number of items is 8 / 0.20 = 40 items
* Now that we know the total number of items is 40, we can calculate the number of junk items:
* 70% of 40 items are junk, which is 0.70 * 40 = 28 junk items

Answer: 28
