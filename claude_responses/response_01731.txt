Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ricciana ran 20 feet and jumped 4 feet, for a total of 24 feet.
2) Margarita ran 18 feet and jumped 1 foot less than twice Ricciana's jump, which is 2 * 4 - 1 = 7 feet.
3) So Margarita's total distance is 18 feet (running) + 7 feet (jumping) = 25 feet.
4) To find the difference between Margarita and Ricciana's total distances, we subtract Ricciana's total distance from Margarita's total distance:
25 feet - 24 feet = 1 foot.
