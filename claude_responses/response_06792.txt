Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Bill's labrador puppy weighs 40 pounds in January.
2. The labrador puppy gains 25% of its starting weight over the year.
   * 25% of 40 pounds = 0.25 * 40 = 10 pounds
   * The labrador puppy's weight at the end of the year is 40 pounds + 10 pounds = 50 pounds.

3. Bill's dachshund puppy weighs 12 pounds in January.
4. The dachshund puppy gains 25% of its starting weight over the year.
   * 25% of 12 pounds = 0.25 * 12 = 3 pounds
   * The dachshund puppy's weight at the end of the year is 12 pounds + 3 pounds = 15 pounds.

5. The difference in their weight at the end of the year is:
   * Labrador puppy: 50 pounds
   * Dachshund puppy: 15 pounds
   * Difference: 50 pounds - 15 pounds = 35 pounds

Answer: 35 pounds
