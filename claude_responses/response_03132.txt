Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bald Mountain received 1.5 meters of snow last week.
2) Billy Mountain received 3.5 meters of snow during a blizzard.
3) Mount Pilot received 126 centimeters of snow during the blizzard.
4) To compare the amounts of snow, we need to convert the measurements to the same unit. Let's use centimeters.
5) 1.5 meters is equal to 150 centimeters.
6) 3.5 meters is equal to 350 centimeters.
7) 126 centimeters is already in the desired unit.
8) The total amount of snow received by Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot is 350 + 126 = 476 centimeters.
9) The amount of snow received by Bald Mountain is 150 centimeters.
10) The difference between the total snow received by Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot, and the snow received by Bald Mountain is 476 - 150 = 326 centimeters.

Answer: 326 centimeters
