Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rob has some baseball cards, and a portion of them are doubles
* One third of Rob's cards are doubles
* Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob
* Jess has 40 doubles baseball cards

First, let's figure out how many doubles Rob has. Since Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob, and Jess has 40 doubles, we can divide 40 by 5 to get the number of doubles Rob has:
* Rob's doubles = 40 / 5 = 8 doubles

Now, we know that one third of Rob's cards are doubles. So, to find the total number of cards Rob has, we can divide the number of doubles (8) by one third:
* Rob's total cards = 8 / (1/3) = 24 cards

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 24
