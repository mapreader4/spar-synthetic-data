Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Victory saves $100 less than Sam.
2) Sam saves $1000.
3) So, Victory saves $1000 - $100 = $900.
4) The total money saved for holiday spending is the sum of Victory's and Sam's savings.
5) Total money saved = Victory's savings + Sam's savings
6) Total money saved = $900 + $1000 = $1900

Answer: 1900
