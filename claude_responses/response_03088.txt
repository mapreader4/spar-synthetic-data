Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Keanu's motorcycle can store 8 liters of gasoline
* The destination is 280 miles away
* The motorcycle consumes 8 liters of gasoline per 40 miles

To calculate the number of times Keanu has to refill his motorcycle, we need to first calculate the total distance he needs to travel, which is the round trip distance.
* Round trip distance = 280 miles + 280 miles = 560 miles

Now, we need to calculate how many 40-mile segments are in the 560-mile round trip.
* 560 miles / 40 miles per segment = 14 segments

Since the motorcycle consumes 8 liters of gasoline per 40-mile segment, we can calculate the total amount of gasoline needed for the round trip.
* 14 segments x 8 liters per segment = 112 liters of gasoline needed

Finally, we can calculate how many times Keanu needs to refill his motorcycle, since it can only hold 8 liters at a time.
* 112 liters / 8 liters per refill = 14 refills

Answer: 14
