Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The laboratory spent $150 on flasks.
2. They spent two-thirds of the flask cost on test tubes. 
   * Two-thirds of $150 is $100.
   * So they spent $100 on test tubes.
3. They spent half of the test tube cost on safety gear.
   * Half of $100 is $50.
   * So they spent $50 on safety gear.

Now, let's add up the total amount they spent:
* Flasks: $150
* Test tubes: $100
* Safety gear: $50
* Total spent: $150 + $100 + $50 = $300

Finally, we can calculate the amount of their budget that remained:
* Total budget: $325
* Total spent: $300
* Amount remaining: $325 - $300 = $25

Answer: $25
