Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The world record for longest fingernails is 26 inches
* Sandy's fingernails are currently 2 inches long
* Sandy's fingernails grow at a rate of one-tenth of an inch per month
* We need to find out how old Sandy will be when her fingernails reach 26 inches

To calculate this, we need to find out how many months it will take for her fingernails to grow from 2 inches to 26 inches.

We know that her fingernails grow 0.1 inches per month, so we can calculate the number of months it will take:
* 26 inches - 2 inches = 24 inches
* 24 inches / 0.1 inches per month = 240 months

Now, we know that Sandy just turned 12 this month, so we can add the 240 months to her current age:
* 12 years + 240 months / 12 months per year = 32 years

Answer: 32
