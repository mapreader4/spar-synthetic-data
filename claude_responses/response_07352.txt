Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 24 students in the class
* Half of the students are doing silent reading
* One-third of the students are playing board games
* The rest are catching up on homework

First, let's calculate how many students are doing silent reading:
* Half of 24 students = 24 / 2 = 12 students

Next, let's calculate how many students are playing board games:
* One-third of 24 students = 24 / 3 = 8 students

Now, we can calculate the number of students catching up on homework by subtracting the number of students doing silent reading and playing board games from the total number of students:
* 24 students - 12 students (silent reading) - 8 students (board games) = 4 students
