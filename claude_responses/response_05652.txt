Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The mathematician has 1 week (7 days) to complete the two projects
* For the first project, he needs to write 518 math questions
* For the second project, he needs to write 476 math questions
* He needs to complete the same number of questions each day

To find the number of questions he should aim to complete each day, we need to:
1. Add up the total number of questions he needs to write:
   * 518 + 476 = 994 total questions
2. Divide the total number of questions by the number of days he has to complete them:
   * 994 questions / 7 days = 142.0 questions per day

Since he needs to complete the same number of questions each day, we round up to the nearest whole number:
* 142.0 questions per day rounds up to 143 questions per day

Answer: 143
