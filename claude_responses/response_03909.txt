Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. John is performing in 3 plays, and each play has 5 Acts.
2. He wears 2 wigs per act.
3. Each wig costs $5.
4. He drops one of the plays and sells all of the wigs for that play for $4 each.

First, let's calculate the total number of wigs he needs for the 3 plays:
* 3 plays x 5 acts per play x 2 wigs per act = 30 wigs

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the wigs:
* 30 wigs x $5 per wig = $150

Next, let's calculate the amount he gets back from selling the wigs for the dropped play:
* 10 wigs (from the dropped play) x $4 per wig = $40

Finally, to calculate the total amount of money he spent, we take the total cost of the wigs and subtract the amount he got back from selling the wigs:
* $150 - $40 = $110

Answer: $110
