Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Theo drinks 8 cups of water every day
* Mason drinks 7 cups of water every day
* Roxy drinks 9 cups of water every day
* We want to find the total cups of water the siblings drink together in one week

To calculate the total cups of water for one week, we need to multiply each sibling's daily water intake by 7 days in a week:
* Theo's weekly water intake: 8 cups/day x 7 days = 56 cups
* Mason's weekly water intake: 7 cups/day x 7 days = 49 cups
* Roxy's weekly water intake: 9 cups/day x 7 days = 63 cups

Now we add up the weekly water intakes of all three siblings:
* Total weekly water intake = 56 cups + 49 cups + 63 cups = 168 cups

Answer: 168 cups
