Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of the dress is $50.
2) The store is offering a 30% discount on everything in the store.
3) To calculate the discounted price, we need to find 30% of the original price and subtract that from the original price.
4) 30% of $50 is 0.30 * $50 = $15.
5) Subtracting the $15 discount from the original $50 price gives us the final cost of the dress.
6) $50 - $15 = $35.
