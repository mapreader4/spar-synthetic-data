Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Madison takes her dog to the dog park
* Half the dogs have spots
* 1/5 of the dogs have pointy ears
* 15 dogs have spots

To find the number of dogs with pointy ears, we need to first find the total number of dogs at the dog park.

Since half the dogs have spots, and there are 15 dogs with spots, the total number of dogs must be:
* 15 dogs with spots = 1/2 of the total number of dogs
* Total number of dogs = 15 x 2 = 30 dogs

Now, we know that 1/5 of the 30 dogs have pointy ears, so:
* Number of dogs with pointy ears = 30 x 1/5 = 6 dogs

Answer: 6
