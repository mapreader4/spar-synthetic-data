Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kristin can run 3 times faster than Sarith
* Kristin runs 12 times around the adult football field
* Sarith runs around the children's football field, which is half the distance of the adult football field
* Since Kristin is 3 times faster than Sarith, and they run the same amount of time, Sarith must run 3 times as many laps around the children's football field to cover the same total distance as Kristin
* Therefore, if Kristin runs 12 laps around the adult football field, Sarith must run 3 times as many laps around the children's football field, which is 12 x 3 = 36 laps

Answer: 36
