Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jay invited 22 people
* Gloria invited 36 people
* They wanted 1 flag for each guest, plus 1 flag each for themselves
* So the total number of flags they need to buy is:
    - 22 (Jay's guests) + 36 (Gloria's guests) + 2 (Jay and Gloria) = 60 flags
* The craft store is selling 5 flags for $1.00
* To calculate the cost, we need to determine how many sets of 5 flags they need to buy:
    - 60 flags / 5 flags per set = 12 sets
* Each set costs $1.00
* Therefore, the total cost would be:
    - 12 sets x $1.00 per set = $12.00

Answer: $12.00
