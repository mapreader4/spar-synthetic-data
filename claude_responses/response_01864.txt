Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that in 5 years, Raven will be 4 times as old as Phoebe.
2) We also know that Phoebe is currently 10 years old.
3) So, in 5 years, Phoebe will be 10 + 5 = 15 years old.
4) Since Raven will be 4 times as old as Phoebe in 5 years, we can calculate Raven's age in 5 years as 4 * 15 = 60 years old.
5) Therefore, Raven's current age is 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Answer: 55
