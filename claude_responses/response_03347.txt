Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Barbara has 9 stuffed animals
2) Trish has two times as many stuffed animals as Barbara, so Trish has 2 * 9 = 18 stuffed animals
3) Barbara will sell her 9 stuffed animals for $2 each, so she will make 9 * $2 = $18
4) Trish will sell her 18 stuffed animals for $1.50 each, so she will make 18 * $1.50 = $27
5) The total money they will donate to their class funds is the sum of the money Barbara and Trish make, which is $18 + $27 = $45
