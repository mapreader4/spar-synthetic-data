Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ember is half as old as Nate, who is 14 years old.
2) This means that Ember's current age is half of Nate's age, which is 14 / 2 = 7 years old.
3) We want to know how old Nate will be when Ember is 14 years old.
4) Since Ember is currently 7 years old, and she will be 14 years old, that means 7 years have passed.
5) If 7 years have passed, and Nate was originally 14 years old, then Nate will be 14 + 7 = 21 years old when Ember is 14.

Answer: 21
