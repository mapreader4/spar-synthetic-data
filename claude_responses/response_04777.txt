Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of each chair is $20.
2) The chairs are 25% off, so the discounted price of each chair is $20 * (1 - 0.25) = $15.
3) You bought 8 chairs, which is more than 5, so you get an additional 1/3 off the discounted price of the number of chairs over 5.
4) The number of chairs over 5 is 8 - 5 = 3.
5) The additional 1/3 off the discounted price of the 3 chairs is $15 * (1 - 1/3) = $10 per chair.
6) The total cost of the 8 chairs is:
   - 5 chairs at $15 each = $75
   - 3 chairs at $10 each = $30
   - Total cost = $75 + $30 = $105.
