Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John receives $100 from his uncle.
2) He gives his sister Jenna 1/4 of that money. 1/4 of $100 is $25.
3) So John gives Jenna $25.
4) John then goes and buys groceries worth $40.
5) To calculate the amount of money John has remaining, we start with the original $100 he received from his uncle.
6) He gave $25 to Jenna, so he has $100 - $25 = $75 remaining.
7) He then spent $40 on groceries, so he has $75 - $40 = $35 remaining.
