Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A normal doctor charges $200 for a visit
* Tom goes to a discount clinic that is 70% cheaper
* It takes two visits to the discount clinic instead of one visit to the normal doctor

First, let's calculate the cost of the discount clinic:
* The discount clinic is 70% cheaper, so the cost per visit is 30% of $200, which is $60

Now, since Tom needs to go to the discount clinic twice, the total cost is:
* 2 visits x $60 per visit = $120

If Tom had gone to the normal doctor, the total cost would have been:
* 1 visit x $200 per visit = $200

The amount of money Tom saves is the difference between the normal doctor cost and the discount clinic cost:
* $200 - $120 = $80

Answer: $80
