Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The conference room has 40 chairs, with a capacity of 2 people each
* The number of board members is the same as the chairs' capacity, which is 2 people per chair
* 2/5 of the chairs were not occupied
* The remaining chairs each had two people

First, let's calculate the total capacity of the conference room:
* 40 chairs x 2 people per chair = 80 people

Now, let's calculate how many chairs were not occupied:
* 2/5 of 40 chairs = 16 chairs not occupied

The remaining chairs were each occupied by 2 people:
* 40 chairs - 16 chairs not occupied = 24 chairs occupied
* 24 chairs x 2 people per chair = 48 people

Therefore, the number of board members who attended the meeting is:
Answer: 48
