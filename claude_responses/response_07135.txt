Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jan buys 5 dozen roses.
2) Each rose costs $6.
3) Since he bought so many, he only needs to pay 80% of the total cost.

To calculate the total cost:
* 5 dozen roses = 5 x 12 = 60 roses
* 60 roses x $6 per rose = $360 total cost

Now, since he only needs to pay 80% of the total cost:
* $360 x 0.8 = $288

Therefore, the amount Jan paid is:
Answer: $288
