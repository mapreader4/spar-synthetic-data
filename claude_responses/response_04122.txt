Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alex has 960 pictures to process
* The program can process each picture in 2 minutes
* To find the total time it will take to process all 960 pictures, we need to multiply the number of pictures by the time it takes to process each one:
* 960 pictures x 2 minutes per picture = 1,920 minutes
* To convert this to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60 minutes per hour:
* 1,920 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 32 hours

Answer: 32 hours
