Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The test has 80 questions total
* For the first 40 questions, John got 90% right
* To calculate the number of questions she got right in the first 40:
    - 90% of 40 = 0.90 * 40 = 36 questions
* For the next 40 questions, John got 95% right
* To calculate the number of questions she got right in the next 40:
    - 95% of 40 = 0.95 * 40 = 38 questions
* To calculate the total number of questions she got right:
    - 36 + 38 = 74 questions

Answer: 74
