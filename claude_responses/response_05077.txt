Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The book has 100 pages total
* Lance wants to finish the book in 3 days
* Yesterday, he read 35 pages
* Today, he read 5 fewer pages than yesterday, which means he read 35 - 5 = 30 pages

Now, to find out how many pages he should read tomorrow to finish the book, we need to calculate the remaining pages:
* Total pages in the book: 100
* Pages read yesterday: 35
* Pages read today: 30
* Total pages read so far: 35 + 30 = 65
* Remaining pages to read: 100 - 65 = 35

Therefore, Lance should read 35 pages tomorrow to finish the book.

Answer: 35
