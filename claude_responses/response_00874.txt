Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Winston has 14 quarters
* 1 quarter = 25 cents
* So, Winston has 14 * 25 = 350 cents
* He then spends half a dollar on candy
* Half a dollar = 50 cents
* So, he spends 50 cents on candy
* To find how many cents he has left, we subtract the amount he spent (50 cents) from the amount he had (350 cents)
* 350 cents - 50 cents = 300 cents

Answer: 300
