Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tim's doctor's visit cost $300.
2. His insurance covered 75% of the doctor's visit cost, which means he had to pay the remaining 25%.
   * 25% of $300 = 0.25 * $300 = $75
3. The cat's visit cost $120.
4. Tim's pet insurance covered $60 of the cat's visit cost.
   * So Tim had to pay the remaining $120 - $60 = $60 for the cat's visit.

Now, to calculate the total amount Tim paid:
* Tim paid $75 for the doctor's visit.
* Tim paid $60 for the cat's visit.
* Total amount Tim paid = $75 + $60 = $135.

Answer: $135.
