Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that 40 people showed up to roller skate on the last night the rink was open.
2) Each person was wearing a pair of roller skates.
3) Each roller skate has 4 wheels.
4) To find the total number of wheels on the floor, we need to multiply the number of people by the number of wheels per pair of roller skates.
5) 40 people x 4 wheels per pair of roller skates = 160 wheels.

Answer: 160
