Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Scarlet saved $80 to spend on jewelry.
2) She bought a pair of earrings that cost $23.
3) She then bought a necklace that cost $48.
4) To calculate how much of her savings she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the earrings and the necklace from the total amount she saved.
5) The cost of the earrings was $23 and the cost of the necklace was $48.
6) The total amount she spent is $23 + $48 = $71.
7) Subtracting the amount she spent ($71) from the amount she saved ($80), we get $80 - $71 = $9.
