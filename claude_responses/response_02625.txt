Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 55% of Toby's friends are boys
* Toby has 33 friends who are boys
* To find the total number of friends Toby has, we can divide the number of boy friends (33) by the percentage of boy friends (55%)
* 33 / 0.55 = 60 total friends
* Since 55% of his friends are boys, the remaining 45% must be girls
* To find the number of girl friends, we can take the total number of friends (60) and multiply it by the percentage of girl friends (45%)
* 60 * 0.45 = 27 girl friends

Answer: 27
