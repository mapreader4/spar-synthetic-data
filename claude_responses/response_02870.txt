Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hanna has $300 to spend on roses.
2) Each rose costs $2.
3) Hanna wants to give some of the roses to her friends Jenna and Imma.
4) Jenna will receive 1/3 of the roses.
5) Imma will receive 1/2 of the roses.
6) To find the total number of roses Hanna can buy with $300, we divide $300 by $2 per rose:
   $300 / $2 per rose = 150 roses
7) To find how many roses Jenna will receive, we take 1/3 of the total roses:
   1/3 of 150 roses = 50 roses
8) To find how many roses Imma will receive, we take 1/2 of the total roses:
   1/2 of 150 roses = 75 roses
9) Therefore, the total number of roses Hanna gives to her friends is:
   50 roses (Jenna) + 75 roses (Imma) = 125 roses

Answer: 125
