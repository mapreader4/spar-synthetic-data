Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kira's cat eats 1 pound of kibble every 4 hours
* Kira fills the bowl with 3 pounds of kibble before going to work
* When Kira returns, there is 1 pound of kibble left in the bowl

To find out how many hours Kira was away from home, we need to calculate how much kibble the cat ate while Kira was away.

We know the cat eats 1 pound of kibble every 4 hours, so in the time Kira was away, the cat would have eaten:
* 3 pounds (the amount in the bowl when Kira left) - 1 pound (the amount left when Kira returned) = 2 pounds

Now we can use this information to calculate the number of hours Kira was away:
* 2 pounds / 1 pound per 4 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Kira was away from home for 8 hours.

Answer: 8
