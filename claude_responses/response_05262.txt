Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Fabian walked for 3 hours
* Every hour he covers 5 kilometers
* So in 3 hours, he covered:
    - 3 hours x 5 kilometers/hour = 15 kilometers
* The total distance he needs to walk is 30 kilometers
* So the remaining distance he needs to walk is:
    - 30 kilometers - 15 kilometers = 15 kilometers
* Since he walks 5 kilometers per hour, to cover the remaining 15 kilometers, he would need:
    - 15 kilometers / 5 kilometers per hour = 3 hours

Answer: 3 hours
