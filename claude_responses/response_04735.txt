Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda per day
* 5 cans x 12 oz per can = 60 oz of soda per day
* Tom also drinks 64 oz of water per day
* So the total fluid Tom drinks per day is:
  - 60 oz of soda + 64 oz of water = 124 oz of fluid per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* So the total fluid Tom drinks in a week is:
  - 124 oz of fluid per day x 7 days per week = 868 oz of fluid per week

Answer: 868
