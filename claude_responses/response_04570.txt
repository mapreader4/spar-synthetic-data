Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom receives a $12 allowance per month.
2) In the first week, he spends a third of his allowance. That means he spends $12 * 1/3 = $4.
3) After the first week, he has $12 - $4 = $8 left.
4) In the second week, he spends a quarter of what he has left. That means he spends $8 * 1/4 = $2.
5) After the second week, he has $8 - $2 = $6 left.

Answer: $6
