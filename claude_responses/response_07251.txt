Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Melissa sells a coupe for $30,000
2) She also sells an SUV for twice as much as the coupe, which means the SUV sells for $60,000 (2 x $30,000)
3) Her commission is 2% on each sale
4) To calculate her commission on the coupe, we take 2% of $30,000, which is $600 (0.02 x $30,000)
5) To calculate her commission on the SUV, we take 2% of $60,000, which is $1,200 (0.02 x $60,000)
6) To get the total amount of money she made, we add the two commissions together:
$600 + $1,200 = $1,800

Answer: $1,800
