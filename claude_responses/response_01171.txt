Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael currently has 30 trophies
* In three years, Michael's trophies will increase by 100
* So, in three years, Michael will have 30 + 100 = 130 trophies
* Jack will have ten times more trophies than Michael has right now, which is 10 * 30 = 300 trophies
* So, the total number of trophies they will have after three years is:
* Michael's trophies: 130
* Jack's trophies: 300
* Total trophies: 130 + 300 = 430

Answer: 430
