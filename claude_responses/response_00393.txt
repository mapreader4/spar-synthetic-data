Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The sandbox is rectangular, so the perimeter formula is: 2 * (length + width) = 30 feet
2) The length is twice the width, so we can substitute length = 2 * width into the perimeter formula:
2 * (2 * width + width) = 30 feet
3) Simplifying the equation:
6 * width = 30 feet
4) Dividing both sides by 6:
width = 5 feet

Answer: 5 feet
