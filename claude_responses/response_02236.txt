Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Evie collects 10 shells each day
* She collects shells for 6 days
* So the total number of shells she collected is:
  * 10 shells per day x 6 days = 60 shells
* At the end, she gives 2 shells to her brother
* So the number of shells she has left is:
  * 60 shells - 2 shells = 58 shells

Answer: 58
