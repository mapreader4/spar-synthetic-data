Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carlson bought land that cost $8000 and additional land that cost $4000, for a total cost of $12000.
2) The land he bought costs $20 per square meter.
3) He initially owned 300 square meters of land.
4) To find the total size of his land after buying the new land, we need to divide the total cost of the new land ($12000) by the cost per square meter ($20).
5) $12000 / $20 = 600 square meters.
6) Adding the 300 square meters he initially owned, his total land is 300 + 600 = 900 square meters.

Answer: 900
