Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Yun had 20 paperclips initially.
2) Yun then lost 12 paperclips, so Yun now has 20 - 12 = 8 paperclips.
3) Marion has 1/4 more than what Yun currently has, which is 8 + (1/4 * 8) = 8 + 2 = 10 paperclips.
4) Marion also has 7 additional paperclips.
5) Therefore, the total number of paperclips Marion has is 10 + 7 = 17 paperclips.

Answer: 17
