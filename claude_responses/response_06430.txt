Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony walks to the store on the weekend, which is 2 MPH
* The store is 4 miles away
* So on the weekend, it takes him 4 miles / 2 MPH = 2 hours to get to the store
* 2 hours = 120 minutes
* On weekdays, he runs to the store, which is 10 MPH
* So on weekdays, it takes him 4 miles / 10 MPH = 0.4 hours to get to the store
* 0.4 hours = 24 minutes
* He goes on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday
* Sunday is a weekend day, so it takes him 120 minutes
* Tuesday and Thursday are weekdays, so it takes him 24 minutes each day
* The total time is 120 + 24 + 24 = 168 minutes
* The average time is 168 minutes / 3 days = 56 minutes
