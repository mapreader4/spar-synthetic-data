Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Justin bought 4 long-sleeved jerseys that cost $15 each
* So the total cost of the long-sleeved jerseys is:
  * 4 jerseys x $15 per jersey = $60
* Justin spent a total of $80
* So the remaining amount spent on the striped jerseys is:
  * $80 - $60 = $20
* The striped jerseys cost $10 each
* To find how many striped jerseys he bought, we divide the remaining amount by the cost per jersey:
  * $20 / $10 per jersey = 2 striped jerseys
