Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The tank can hold 600 gallons of water.
2) Each bucket holds 5 gallons of water.
3) Jack can carry 2 buckets at a time, so he can bring 10 gallons per trip.
4) Jill can only carry 1 bucket at a time, so she can bring 5 gallons per trip.
5) Jack can make 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips.
6) To calculate how many trips Jill will make, we need to figure out how much water Jack can bring in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips.
7) In the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips, Jack can make 3 trips.
8) In 3 trips, Jack can bring 3 * 10 = 30 gallons.
9) So the remaining amount of water that Jill needs to bring is 600 - 30 = 570 gallons.
10) Since Jill can bring 5 gallons per trip, she will need to make 570 / 5 = 114 trips.

Answer: 114
