Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Angelo and Melanie have 2 chapters of their textbook to study, and each chapter requires 3 hours of study time.
* They also have 4 worksheets to memorize, and each worksheet requires 1.5 hours of study time.
* In total, the textbook study time is 2 chapters x 3 hours = 6 hours, and the worksheet study time is 4 worksheets x 1.5 hours = 6 hours.
* The total study time is 6 hours + 6 hours = 12 hours.
* They plan to study no more than 4 hours each day.
* They will take a 10-minute break every hour, which means they will have 12 breaks of 10 minutes each, or 2 hours of break time.
* They will also have 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, which is 30 minutes per day, or 3.5 hours of snack time over the week.
* They will have 30 minutes for lunch each day, which is 3.5 hours of lunch time over the week.
* The total time spent on breaks, snacks, and lunch is 2 hours + 3.5 hours + 3.5 hours = 9 hours.
* Therefore, the total time they need to study is 12 hours + 9 hours = 21 hours.
* Since they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, they will need to study for at least 6 days.

Answer: 6 days
