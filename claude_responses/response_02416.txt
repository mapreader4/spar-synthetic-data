Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Annie has 6 barrettes.
2) She has twice as many scrunchies as barrettes, so she has 2 * 6 = 12 scrunchies.
3) She has three fewer bobby pins than barrettes, so she has 6 - 3 = 3 bobby pins.
4) The total number of hair decorations is 6 barrettes + 12 scrunchies + 3 bobby pins = 21 hair decorations.
5) The number of bobby pins is 3, and the total number of hair decorations is 21.
6) To calculate the percentage of hair decorations that are bobby pins, we divide the number of bobby pins by the total number of hair decorations and multiply by 100:
(3 / 21) * 100 = 14.29%
7) Rounding to the nearest percent, the answer is:
Answer: 14%
