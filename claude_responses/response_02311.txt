Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Melody has 3 dogs
* Each dog eats 1/2 pound of dog food twice a day
* So each dog eats 1 pound of dog food per day
* With 3 dogs, that's 3 pounds of dog food per day
* In a week, there are 7 days
* So in a week, the 3 dogs will eat 3 pounds x 7 days = 21 pounds of dog food
* Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food
* 30 pounds - 21 pounds = 9 pounds of dog food left
