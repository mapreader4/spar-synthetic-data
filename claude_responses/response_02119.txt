Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The class has 12 students.
2) Initially, there were 108 oranges to be shared equally among the 12 students.
3) 36 of the oranges were bad and had to be thrown away.
4) The remaining number of oranges is 108 - 36 = 72 oranges.
5) If no oranges had to be thrown away, each student would have gotten 108 / 12 = 9 oranges.
6) Now, with 72 oranges to be shared, each student will get 72 / 12 = 6 oranges.
7) The difference between the original number of oranges per student (9) and the new number of oranges per student (6) is 9 - 6 = 3 oranges.
