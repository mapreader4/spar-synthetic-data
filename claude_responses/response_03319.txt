Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The original length of the yarn was 10 meters.
* The yarn was cut into 5 equal parts.
* 3 of those parts were used for crocheting.

To find the length used for crocheting, we need to first find the length of each part:
* Length of each part = 10 meters / 5 = 2 meters

Since 3 parts were used for crocheting, the total length used for crocheting is:
* Length used for crocheting = 3 parts x 2 meters per part = 6 meters

Answer: 6 meters
