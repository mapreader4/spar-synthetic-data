Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bobby has 2 pizzas, and each pizza has 6 slices.
2) So, the total number of slices Bobby has is 2 pizzas x 6 slices per pizza = 12 slices.
3) Mrs. Kaplan has 1/4 as many pizza slices as Bobby.
4) To find the number of slices Mrs. Kaplan has, we take the total number of slices Bobby has (12) and divide it by 4 (since Mrs. Kaplan has 1/4 as many).
5) 12 slices / 4 = 3 slices.
