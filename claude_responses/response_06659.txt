Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that in 2 years, Maxwell will be twice his sister's age.
2) We also know that his sister is currently 2 years old.
3) So in 2 years, his sister will be 4 years old.
4) And in 2 years, Maxwell will be twice his sister's age, which means he will be 8 years old.
5) Therefore, if Maxwell will be 8 years old in 2 years, he must currently be 6 years old.
