Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ryan bikes to work once a week, and it takes him 30 minutes to do so.
2. He takes the bus three times a week, and the bus takes 10 minutes longer than biking, so 30 + 10 = 40 minutes per bus trip.
3. He gets a ride from a friend once a week, and this cuts two-thirds off his biking time, so 30 - (2/3 * 30) = 30 - 20 = 10 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent commuting to work every week:
* Biking: 1 day x 30 minutes = 30 minutes
* Bus: 3 days x 40 minutes = 120 minutes
* Friend's ride: 1 day x 10 minutes = 10 minutes

Adding these up, we get:
* Total time spent commuting to work every week = 30 + 120 + 10 = 160 minutes

Answer: 160 minutes
