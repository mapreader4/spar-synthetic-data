Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emma spent $58 in total.
2) Elsa spent twice as much as Emma, so Elsa spent $58 * 2 = $116.
3) Elizabeth spent four times as much as Elsa, so Elizabeth spent $116 * 4 = $464.
4) To find the total amount spent, we add up the amounts spent by each person:
   Total amount spent = Emma's spending + Elsa's spending + Elizabeth's spending
   Total amount spent = $58 + $116 + $464 = $638

Answer: 638
