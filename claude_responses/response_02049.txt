Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark and Chris both leave their house for school at the same time
* They travel at the same speed, which is 3 miles per hour (Chris's speed)
* After walking 3 miles, Mark has to turn around and go back home
* The distance from their house to the school is 9 miles

To calculate how much longer Mark spends walking than Chris, we need to find the total distance Mark walks and the total distance Chris walks, then calculate the difference.

Mark's total distance:
* Walks 3 miles to the point where he turns around
* Walks 3 miles back home
* Walks 9 miles to school
* Total distance = 3 + 3 + 9 = 15 miles

Chris's total distance:
* Walks 9 miles to school
* Total distance = 9 miles

Now, we can calculate the difference in time:
* Mark's total distance = 15 miles
* Chris's total distance = 9 miles
* Difference in distance = 15 - 9 = 6 miles
* Since they both travel at the same speed of 3 miles per hour, the difference in time is:
* 6 miles / 3 miles per hour = 2 hours
