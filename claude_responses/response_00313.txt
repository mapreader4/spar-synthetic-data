Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill has 60 toys
* Hash has half as many toys as Bill, plus 9 more
* To find how many toys Hash has, we first find half of Bill's toys:
    - Half of 60 is 30
* Then we add 9 more to that:
    - 30 + 9 = 39
* So Hash has 39 toys
* To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add Bill's toys and Hash's toys:
    - 60 + 39 = 99

Answer: 99
