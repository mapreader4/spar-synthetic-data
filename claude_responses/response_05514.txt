Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The cooler is filled with 24 cans of cherry soda and orange pop.
2) There are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda.
3) Let's represent the number of cherry soda cans as x.
4) Since there are twice as many cans of orange pop, the number of orange pop cans is 2x.
5) The total number of cans is 24, so we can write the equation: x + 2x = 24
6) Solving for x, we get: 3x = 24
7) Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 8
Answer: 8
