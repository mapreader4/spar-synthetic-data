Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John adopts a dog from a shelter
* The dog has health problems that require 3 vet appointments
* Each vet appointment costs $400
* After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits

So, the first vet appointment cost $400, and John paid the full amount.

For the second and third vet appointments, the insurance covers 80% of the cost, so John only has to pay 20% of the $400 cost for each visit.

* Second visit cost: $400 * 0.20 = $80
* Third visit cost: $400 * 0.20 = $80

Now, we can calculate the total amount John paid:
* First visit: $400
* Second visit: $80
* Third visit: $80
* Pet insurance: $100

Total amount paid = $400 + $80 + $80 + $100 = $660

Answer: $660
