Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Paul assigns a total of 265 points in the first quarter
* There are 4 times as many test points as quiz points
* There are 5 more quiz points than homework points

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of homework points
* Let y = the number of quiz points
* Let z = the number of test points

We know that:
* y = x + 5 (there are 5 more quiz points than homework points)
* z = 4y (there are 4 times as many test points as quiz points)
* x + y + z = 265 (the total points assigned is 265)

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:
* x + (x + 5) + 4(x + 5) = 265
* x + x + 5 + 4x + 20 = 265
* 6x + 25 = 265
* 6x = 240
* x = 40

Therefore, the number of homework points is 40.

Answer: 40
