Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The retail price of the bike is $600.
2) Maria has saved $120 towards the purchase.
3) Her mother has offered her $250.
4) To calculate the remaining amount Maria needs to earn, we first need to add up the amount she has already:
   - Saved: $120
   - Offered by mother: $250
   - Total: $120 + $250 = $370
5) Now we can subtract this total from the retail price of the bike to find the remaining amount:
   - Retail price: $600
   - Amount Maria has: $370
   - Remaining amount: $600 - $370 = $230

Answer: $230
