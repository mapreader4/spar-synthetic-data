Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Miriam did 5 push-ups.
2. On Tuesday, Miriam did 7 push-ups.
3. On Wednesday, Miriam did twice as many push-ups as the day before, which is 7 x 2 = 14 push-ups.
4. On Thursday, Miriam did half the number of total pushups she already did that week. 
   * The total number of pushups she did in the first 3 days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26.
   * Half of 26 is 13, so Miriam did 13 push-ups on Thursday.
5. On Friday, Miriam did as many push-ups as the total number she did over the previous four days.
   * The total number of push-ups she did in the first 4 days is 5 + 7 + 14 + 13 = 39.
   * Therefore, on Friday, Miriam did 39 push-ups.

Answer: 39
