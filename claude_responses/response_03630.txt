Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The construction company is building 2 apartment buildings
* Each building has 12 floors
* Each floor has 6 apartments
* Each apartment needs 7 doors in total

First, we need to calculate the total number of apartments:
* 2 buildings x 12 floors per building x 6 apartments per floor = 144 apartments

Next, we need to calculate the total number of doors required:
* 144 apartments x 7 doors per apartment = 1,008 doors

Therefore, the construction company needs to buy 1,008 doors.

Answer: 1,008
