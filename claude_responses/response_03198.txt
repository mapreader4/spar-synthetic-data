Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Drew got 20 questions correct and 6 questions wrong
* Carla got 14 questions correct
* Carla got twice as many questions wrong as the number of questions Drew got wrong, which is 2 * 6 = 12 questions wrong

Now, we need to find the total number of questions asked in the competition.

The total number of questions asked is the sum of the questions answered correctly and the questions answered incorrectly by both competitors.

Drew answered 20 questions correctly and 6 questions incorrectly, so that's 20 + 6 = 26 questions.
Carla answered 14 questions correctly and 12 questions incorrectly, so that's 14 + 12 = 26 questions.

The total number of questions asked in the competition is the sum of the questions answered by both competitors:
26 + 26 = 52 questions

Answer: 52
