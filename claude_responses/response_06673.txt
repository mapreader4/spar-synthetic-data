Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sherman has a 30-minute commute to the office and a 30-minute commute home every day.
* This means he drives 1 hour per day on his weekday commute (30 minutes to the office + 30 minutes home).
* There are 5 weekdays in a week, so his weekday commute is 1 hour x 5 days = 5 hours per week.
* On the weekends, he spends 2 hours each day driving his kids to their different activities.
* There are 2 weekend days in a week, so his weekend driving is 2 hours x 2 days = 4 hours per week.
* To calculate the total hours Sherman drives per week, we add his weekday commute and his weekend driving:
* 5 hours (weekday commute) + 4 hours (weekend driving) = 9 hours per week.

Answer: 9 hours
