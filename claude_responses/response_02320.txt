Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harry orders 2 large pizzas
* Each large pizza costs $14
* Each pizza has 3 toppings
* Each topping costs $2
* So the cost of the 2 large pizzas with 3 toppings each is:
  - 2 pizzas x $14 per pizza = $28
  - 6 toppings x $2 per topping = $12
  - Total cost of pizzas = $28 + $12 = $40
* He then adds a 25% tip
* 25% of $40 is 0.25 x $40 = $10
* The total cost is the cost of the pizzas plus the tip:
  - $40 + $10 = $50
