Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brandon can catch 6 squirrels or 2 rabbits in 1 hour
* Each squirrel has 300 calories
* Each rabbit has 800 calories
* To calculate the calories from squirrels:
  - 6 squirrels x 300 calories per squirrel = 1,800 calories
* To calculate the calories from rabbits:
  - 2 rabbits x 800 calories per rabbit = 1,600 calories
* The difference in calories between catching squirrels and rabbits is:
  - 1,800 calories (squirrels) - 1,600 calories (rabbits) = 200 calories

Answer: 200
