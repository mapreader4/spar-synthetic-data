Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Chad bought 6 packages of cat food, and each package contained 9 cans. So the total number of cans of cat food is:
6 packages x 9 cans per package = 54 cans of cat food
2) Chad bought 2 packages of dog food, and each package contained 3 cans. So the total number of cans of dog food is:
2 packages x 3 cans per package = 6 cans of dog food
3) To find the difference between the number of cans of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of cans of dog food from the number of cans of cat food:
54 cans of cat food - 6 cans of dog food = 48 more cans of cat food than dog food

Answer: 48
