Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. The area of the first rectangle is the width multiplied by the height:
   Area of first rectangle = 4 inches x 5 inches = 20 square inches

2. The area of the second rectangle is the width multiplied by the height:
   Area of second rectangle = 3 inches x 6 inches = 18 square inches

3. To find the difference in area between the two rectangles, we subtract the area of the second rectangle from the area of the first rectangle:
   Difference in area = 20 square inches - 18 square inches = 2 square inches
