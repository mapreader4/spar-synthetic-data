Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The crayon box has a total of 24 crayons
* 8 crayons are red
* 6 crayons are blue
* There are 2/3 the number of green crayons as blue crayons
* The remaining crayons are pink

First, let's find the number of green crayons:
* There are 2/3 the number of green crayons as blue crayons
* So, if there are 6 blue crayons, then there are 2/3 * 6 = 4 green crayons

Now, let's find the number of pink crayons:
* We know the total number of crayons is 24
* We know there are 8 red crayons, 6 blue crayons, and 4 green crayons
* So the number of pink crayons must be the remaining crayons: 24 - 8 - 6 - 4 = 6

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 6
