Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total square footage of the two bedrooms is 300 square feet.
2) Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's bedroom.
3) Let's call the size of Martha's bedroom 'x' square feet.
4) Then, the size of Jenny's bedroom is 'x + 60' square feet.
5) The total square footage of the two bedrooms is 'x + (x + 60) = 2x + 60'.
6) We know the total square footage is 300, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 60 = 300.
7) Solving for x, we get: 2x = 240, so x = 120.

Answer: 120 square feet.
