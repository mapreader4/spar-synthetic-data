Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Edith had 60 files to start with
* She organized half of them in the morning
* To find how many files she organized in the morning, we take half of 60:
    * 60 / 2 = 30 files
* She has another 15 files to organize in the afternoon
* To find the total number of files she has organized, we add the 30 files from the morning and the 15 files from the afternoon:
    * 30 + 15 = 45 files
* To find the number of files that are missing, we take the original 60 files and subtract the 45 files that have been organized:
    * 60 - 45 = 15 files

Answer: 15
