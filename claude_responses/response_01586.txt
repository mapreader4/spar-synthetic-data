Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Emma traveled 280 miles in 2 hours and 20 minutes.
2) To calculate the average speed, we need to convert the time to hours.
3) 2 hours and 20 minutes = 2.33 hours (2 hours + 20/60 hours)
4) The average speed is the distance traveled divided by the time taken.
5) Average speed = 280 miles / 2.33 hours
6) Average speed = 120 miles per hour.

Answer: 120
