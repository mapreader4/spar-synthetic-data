Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jake and his friend split 8 shots of vodka.
2) Each shot of vodka is 1.5 ounces.
3) The vodka is 50% pure alcohol.
4) To calculate the amount of pure alcohol Jake drank, we need to first find the total amount of vodka he drank.
5) Since Jake and his friend split the 8 shots, Jake drank 4 shots of vodka.
6) Each shot of vodka is 1.5 ounces, so Jake drank a total of 4 * 1.5 = 6 ounces of vodka.
7) The vodka is 50% pure alcohol, so the amount of pure alcohol in the 6 ounces of vodka is 50% of 6 ounces.
8) 50% of 6 ounces is 0.5 * 6 = 3 ounces.

Answer: 3 ounces.
