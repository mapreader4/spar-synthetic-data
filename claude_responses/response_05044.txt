Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 80 students at Rainbow Preschool.
2) 25% of the students are half-day students, which means they get picked up at noon.
3) To find the number of half-day students, we take 25% of 80:
   * 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20 half-day students
4) The remaining students are full-day students.
5) To find the number of full-day students, we subtract the number of half-day students from the total number of students:
   * 80 - 20 = 60 full-day students

Answer: 60
