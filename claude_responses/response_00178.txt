Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total cost of the flowers before the discount:
   * 5 pansies at $2.50 each = $12.50
   * 1 hydrangea at $12.50 = $12.50
   * 5 petunias at $1.00 each = $5.00
   * Total cost before discount = $12.50 + $12.50 + $5.00 = $30.00

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   * The garden center is offering a 10% discount on all purchases
   * 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 x $30.00 = $3.00

3. Calculate the total cost after the discount:
   * Total cost before discount = $30.00
   * Discount amount = $3.00
   * Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

4. Calculate the change Simon would receive:
   * Simon paid with a $50 bill
   * Total cost after discount = $27.00
   * Change = $50.00 - $27.00 = $23.00

Answer: $23.00
