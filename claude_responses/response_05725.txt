Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim learns 10 words from the book per day
* In 2 years, the number of words he knows has increased by 50%
* We need to find the original number of words he knew

First, let's calculate how many words he learned in 2 years:
* 10 words per day x 365 days per year x 2 years = 7,300 words learned

Now, we know that the total number of words he knows has increased by 50%. This means that the original number of words he knew plus the 7,300 words he learned is 150% of the original number.

Let's call the original number of words he knew "x".
* x + 7,300 = 1.5x
* 0.5x = 7,300
* x = 14,600

Therefore, the original number of words Tim knew was 14,600.

Answer: 14,600
