Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, which cost $0.15 each, so the total cost of the bread is 2 * $0.15 = $0.30
* The slice of ham costs $0.25
* The slice of cheese costs $0.35
* To calculate the total cost to Joe to make a sandwich with one slice of each protein, we add up the costs:
* Cost of bread: $0.30
* Cost of ham: $0.25
* Cost of cheese: $0.35
* Total cost: $0.30 + $0.25 + $0.35 = $0.90
