Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The plant is currently 20 feet tall
* After a year (12 months), the plant will be 80 feet tall
* We need to find the monthly growth rate, which is the amount the plant grows each month
* To find the monthly growth rate, we need to calculate the total growth over the year and divide it by the number of months
* The total growth over the year is 80 feet - 20 feet = 60 feet
* Dividing the total growth by the number of months (12) gives us the monthly growth rate
* 60 feet / 12 months = 5 feet per month
