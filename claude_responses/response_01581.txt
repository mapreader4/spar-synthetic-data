Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Jamie owns 4 Persian cats and 2 Maine Coons.
2) Gordon owns half as many Persians as Jamie, which is 2 Persian cats.
3) Gordon owns one more Maine Coon than Jamie, which is 3 Maine Coons.
4) Hawkeye owns one less Maine Coon than Gordon, which is 2 Maine Coons.
5) Hawkeye owns no Persian cats.

Now, let's add up all the cats:
* Jamie's cats: 4 Persian + 2 Maine Coon = 6 cats
* Gordon's cats: 2 Persian + 3 Maine Coon = 5 cats
* Hawkeye's cats: 2 Maine Coon = 2 cats

Total number of cats: 6 + 5 + 2 = 13 cats

Answer: 13
