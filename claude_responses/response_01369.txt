Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The high school bowling team's 3 members scored a total of 810 points in their first match.
* The first bowler scored 1/3 as many points as the second bowler.
* The second bowler scored 3 times as high as the third bowler.

Let's assign variables to represent the points scored by each bowler:
* First bowler: x
* Second bowler: 3x
* Third bowler: x/3

We know that the total points scored by the 3 bowlers is 810, so we can set up an equation:
* x + 3x + x/3 = 810

Solving this equation:
* x + 3x + x/3 = 810
* 4.33x = 810
* x = 810 / 4.33
* x = 187

Therefore, the third bowler scored 187/3 = 62 points.

Answer: 62
