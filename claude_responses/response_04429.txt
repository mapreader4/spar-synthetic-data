Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ivy drinks 2.5 liters of water each day.
2) We need to find how much water Ivy will need for 4 days.
3) To do this, we multiply the daily water consumption by the number of days:
2.5 liters per day x 4 days = 10 liters
4) Each bottle of water is 2 liters.
5) To find how many bottles Ivy needs to buy, we divide the total water needed by the size of each bottle:
10 liters / 2 liters per bottle = 5 bottles

Answer: 5 bottles
