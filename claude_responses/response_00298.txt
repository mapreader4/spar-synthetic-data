Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were some number of sweets on the table.
* Jack came and took half of all the candies, plus 4 more.
* So if we let the initial number of sweets be x, then Jack took x/2 + 4 sweets.
* After Jack took his sweets, there were x - (x/2 + 4) = x/2 - 4 sweets left on the table.
* Then Paul came and took the remaining 7 sweets.
* So the number of sweets left on the table after Paul took his share was 0.
* We can set up an equation to solve for the initial number of sweets x:
x/2 - 4 = 7
* Solving this equation, we get:
x/2 = 11
x = 22

Answer: 22
