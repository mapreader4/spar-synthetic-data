Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Zoe is buying soda and pizza for herself and 5 family members, for a total of 6 people.
* Each bottle of soda costs $0.50.
* Each slice of pizza costs $1.
* We need to calculate the total cost of the soda and pizza.

For the soda:
* Zoe and her 5 family members each need 1 bottle of soda.
* 6 bottles of soda at $0.50 each = 6 x $0.50 = $3.00

For the pizza:
* Zoe and her 5 family members each need 1 slice of pizza.
* 6 slices of pizza at $1 each = 6 x $1 = $6.00

The total cost of the soda and pizza is:
* $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Zoe took $9.00 with her to the store to pay for the soda and pizza.
