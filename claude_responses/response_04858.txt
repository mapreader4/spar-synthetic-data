Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The price of lemons increased by $4 per lemon. So, the new price of lemons is $8 + $4 = $12 per lemon.
2) The price of grapes increased by half the price that the price of lemon increased by per grape. The price of lemons increased by $4, so the price of grapes increased by $4 / 2 = $2 per grape. The new price of grapes is $7 + $2 = $9 per grape.
3) Erick had 80 lemons and 140 grapes in his basket.
4) To calculate the total money collected, we multiply the new prices by the quantities:
   - Lemons: 80 lemons x $12 per lemon = $960
   - Grapes: 140 grapes x $9 per grape = $1,260
5) The total money collected is the sum of the money from lemons and grapes:
   $960 + $1,260 = $2,220

Answer: $2,220
