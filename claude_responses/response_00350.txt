Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chandler needs to sell a total of 12 rolls of wrapping paper for the school fundraiser.
* So far, he has sold:
  - 3 rolls to his grandmother
  - 4 rolls to his uncle
  - 3 rolls to a neighbor
* Adding up the rolls he has already sold:
  - 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 rolls
* To find how many more rolls he needs to sell, we take the total he needs to sell (12) and subtract the number he has already sold (10):
  - 12 - 10 = 2 rolls
