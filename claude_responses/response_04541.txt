Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark needs to let the bread rise for 120 minutes, and he has to do this twice.
* So the total time for the rising process is 120 minutes x 2 = 240 minutes.
* He also needs to spend 10 minutes kneading the bread.
* And he needs to spend 30 minutes baking the bread.
* So the total time for the process is:
* Rising time: 240 minutes
* Kneading time: 10 minutes
* Baking time: 30 minutes
* Total time = 240 + 10 + 30 = 280 minutes.

Answer: 280 minutes.
