Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Javier spends 30 minutes outlining his speech.
2) He then spends 28 more minutes writing than outlining. So, the time spent writing is 30 minutes + 28 minutes = 58 minutes.
3) He then spends half as much time practicing as writing. So, the time spent practicing is 58 minutes / 2 = 29 minutes.
4) To find the total time spent on the speech, we add up the time spent outlining, writing, and practicing:
30 minutes + 58 minutes + 29 minutes = 117 minutes.

Answer: 117
