Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that 3/5 of the light bulbs in the kitchen are broken. This means that 2/5 of the light bulbs in the kitchen are not broken.
2. We know that there are 35 light bulbs in the kitchen, so 2/5 of 35 is the number of light bulbs in the kitchen that are not broken.
   * 2/5 of 35 = 14

3. We know that 1/3 of the light bulbs in the foyer are broken, and that 10 light bulbs in the foyer are broken.
   * If 1/3 of the light bulbs in the foyer are broken, and 10 light bulbs are broken, then the total number of light bulbs in the foyer must be 30.
   * This means that 2/3 of the light bulbs in the foyer are not broken.
   * 2/3 of 30 = 20

4. So the total number of light bulbs that are not broken in both the foyer and kitchen is:
   * 14 (in the kitchen) + 20 (in the foyer) = 34

Answer: 34
