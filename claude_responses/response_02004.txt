Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The average of marks scored in four tests by Jake was 75.
2) Jake scored 80 marks in the first test.
3) Jake scored 10 more marks in the second test than in the first test, so he scored 90 marks in the second test.
4) Jake scored an equal number of marks in the third and fourth tests.
5) The total marks scored by Jake in the four tests is the average (75) multiplied by the number of tests (4), which is 300.
6) The total marks scored in the first two tests is 80 + 90 = 170.
7) The total marks scored in the third and fourth tests is 300 - 170 = 130.
8) Since Jake scored an equal number of marks in the third and fourth tests, the marks scored in each of these tests is 130 / 2 = 65.

Answer: 65
