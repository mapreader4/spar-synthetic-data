Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Friday, the 5th graders raised $147.

2. On Saturday, they made $7 more than twice their Friday earnings. 
   * Twice their Friday earnings would be 2 x $147 = $294.
   * They made $7 more than that, so their Saturday earnings were $294 + $7 = $301.

3. On Sunday, their earnings were $78 more than their earnings on Friday.
   * Their Friday earnings were $147.
   * Their Sunday earnings were $147 + $78 = $225.

4. To calculate the total earnings over the three days, we add up the earnings from each day:
   * Friday: $147
   * Saturday: $301
   * Sunday: $225
   * Total: $147 + $301 + $225 = $673

Answer: 673
