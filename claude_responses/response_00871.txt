Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In 2021, Wayne is 37 years old.
* Peter is 3 years older than Wayne, so Peter is 37 + 3 = 40 years old in 2021.
* Julia is 2 years older than Peter, so Julia is 40 + 2 = 42 years old in 2021.
* To find the year Julia was born, we need to subtract her age in 2021 (42) from the year 2021.
* 2021 - 42 = 1979.

Answer: 1979.
