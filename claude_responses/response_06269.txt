Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tommy has 13 items in his pencil case
* The number of pens is twice the number of pencils
* There is one eraser

Let's represent the number of pencils as x.
* Then the number of pens is 2x
* The total number of items is 13, which is the sum of the pencils, pens, and the eraser
* So, x + 2x + 1 = 13

Solving this equation:
* 3x + 1 = 13
* 3x = 12
* x = 4

Therefore, the number of pencils is 4.

Answer: 4
