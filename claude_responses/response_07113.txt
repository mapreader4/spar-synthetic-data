Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Darius has 5 buckets of water
* The first bucket contains 11 ounces
* The second bucket contains 13 ounces
* The third bucket contains 12 ounces
* The fourth bucket contains 16 ounces
* The fifth bucket contains 10 ounces
* Darius pours the 10-ounce bucket and one of the other four buckets into a bigger bucket
* The total in the bigger bucket is now 23 ounces
* To find the amount in the other bucket that was poured into the bigger bucket, we subtract the 10 ounces from the total 23 ounces:
* 23 ounces - 10 ounces = 13 ounces
* So the other bucket that was poured into the bigger bucket contained 13 ounces
* Darius then pours the remaining three buckets (11 ounces, 12 ounces, and 16 ounces) into a second large bucket
* To find the total amount in the second large bucket, we add up the remaining three buckets:
* 11 ounces + 12 ounces + 16 ounces = 39 ounces

Answer: 39 ounces
