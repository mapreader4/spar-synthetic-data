Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Calvin buys a pack of chips for $0.50 from the vending machine
* He does this 5 days a week
* We want to know how much money he has spent on chips after 4 weeks

To calculate the total amount of money spent, we need to:
1. Calculate the amount spent per week
2. Multiply the amount spent per week by the number of weeks

Amount spent per week:
* $0.50 per pack of chips
* 5 days per week
* Therefore, the amount spent per week is $0.50 x 5 = $2.50

Amount spent after 4 weeks:
* $2.50 per week
* 4 weeks
* Therefore, the total amount spent is $2.50 x 4 = $10.00

Answer: $10.00
