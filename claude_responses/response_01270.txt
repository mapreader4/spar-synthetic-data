Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Danielle bought a new house for $280,000
* She paid a $40,000 deposit on the house
* The remaining balance is $280,000 - $40,000 = $240,000
* This remaining balance of $240,000 is spread out over 10 years
* To calculate the monthly payment, we need to divide the remaining balance by the number of months in 10 years
* There are 12 months in a year, so 10 years is 120 months
* $240,000 / 120 months = $2,000 per month

Therefore, the amount Danielle pays each month is:
Answer: $2,000
