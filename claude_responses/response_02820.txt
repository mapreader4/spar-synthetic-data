Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cow has 16 spots on its left side.
2) The cow has three times the number of spots on its right side, plus 7.
3) To find the number of spots on the right side, we take the number of spots on the left side (16) and multiply it by 3, then add 7.
4) 16 x 3 = 48
5) 48 + 7 = 55
6) So the cow has 16 spots on the left side and 55 spots on the right side.
7) To find the total number of spots, we add the spots on the left and right sides:
16 + 55 = 71

Answer: 71
