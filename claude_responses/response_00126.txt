Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob has 10 roommates
* John has five more roommates than twice as many as Bob
* To find the number of roommates John has, we first need to calculate twice as many as Bob
* Twice as many as Bob is 2 x 10 = 20 roommates
* John has five more roommates than 20, which is 20 + 5 = 25 roommates

Answer: 25
