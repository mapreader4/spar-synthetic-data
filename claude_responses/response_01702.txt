Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total number of guests at the party was 60.
* 2/3 of the guests were male.
* To find the number of male guests, we can multiply the total number of guests (60) by 2/3:
  * 60 * 2/3 = 40 male guests
* To find the number of female guests, we need to subtract the number of male guests from the total number of guests:
  * 60 - 40 = 20 female guests

Answer: 20
