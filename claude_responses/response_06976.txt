Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carina puts 20 more seashells in the jar each week than the week before
* This week, there are 50 seashells in the jar
* We want to know how many seashells will be in the jar in a month (4 weeks)

Let's start with this week:
* This week, there are 50 seashells in the jar

Now, let's look at the next week:
* Carina puts 20 more seashells in the jar than the week before
* So, next week there will be 50 + 20 = 70 seashells in the jar

The week after that:
* Carina puts 20 more seashells in the jar than the week before
* So, the third week there will be 70 + 20 = 90 seashells in the jar

The fourth week:
* Carina puts 20 more seashells in the jar than the week before
* So, the fourth week there will be 90 + 20 = 110 seashells in the jar

Now, to find the total number of seashells in the jar after a month (4 weeks), we add up the number of seashells in each week:
* 50 + 70 + 90 + 110 = 320

Answer: 320
