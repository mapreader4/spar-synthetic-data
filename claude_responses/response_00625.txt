Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The council pays for adding 14 trash cans to the streets.
2) The council also pays for adding twice as many trash cans to the back of stores.
3) To find the total number of trash cans the town has paid for, we need to add the number of trash cans added to the streets and the number of trash cans added to the back of stores.
4) The number of trash cans added to the back of stores is twice the number added to the streets, which is 14 * 2 = 28.
5) The total number of trash cans the town has paid for is 14 + 28 = 42.

Answer: 42
