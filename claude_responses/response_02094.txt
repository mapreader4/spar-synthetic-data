Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 2 adults in the family
* Each adult ticket costs $22
* So the total cost for the 2 adult tickets is:
2 adults x $22 per ticket = $44
* There are 2 children in the family
* Each child ticket costs $7
* So the total cost for the 2 child tickets is:
2 children x $7 per ticket = $14
* To get the total price the family will pay, we add the cost of the adult tickets and the cost of the child tickets:
$44 + $14 = $58

Answer: 58
