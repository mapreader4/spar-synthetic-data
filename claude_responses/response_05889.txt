Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aziz's parents moved to America in 1982
* The current year is 2021
* Aziz just celebrated his 36th birthday

To find out how many years Aziz's parents had been living in America before Aziz was born, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of years between 1982 and 2021
2. Subtract Aziz's age (36) from the number of years between 1982 and 2021

Step 1: 
* 2021 - 1982 = 39 years

Step 2:
* 39 years - 36 years = 3 years

Therefore, Aziz's parents had been living in America for 3 years before Aziz was born.
