Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Stu has 9 books.
2) Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu.
3) To find how many books Albert has, we multiply Stu's books (9) by 4:
9 books x 4 = 36 books
4) Now we add Stu's books (9) and Albert's books (36) to get the total number of books:
9 books + 36 books = 45 books

Answer: 45
