Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Wednesday, Max played for 2 hours
* On Thursday, Max played for 2 hours (the same as Wednesday)
* On Friday, Max played for more than 3 hours longer than Wednesday
* So on Friday, Max played for at least 2 + 3 = 5 hours

Now, to calculate the average:
* Total hours played = 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 hours
* Number of days = 3 days
* Average hours played per day = 9 hours / 3 days = 3 hours

Answer: 3 hours
