Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has 4 pens for emu
* Each pen has 6 emus in it
* So the total number of emus is 4 pens x 6 emus per pen = 24 emus
* Half of the emus are females
* So the number of female emus is 24 / 2 = 12 female emus
* Each female emu lays 1 egg per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* Therefore, the total number of eggs laid in a week is 12 female emus x 7 days = 84 eggs

Answer: 84
