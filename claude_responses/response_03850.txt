Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The pyramid has 4 levels.
2) The top level is 1 case.
3) Each subsequent level has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it.
4) So the levels from top to bottom are:
   - Level 1: 1 case
   - Level 2: 2 cases x 2 cases = 4 cases
   - Level 3: 3 cases x 3 cases = 9 cases
   - Level 4: 4 cases x 4 cases = 16 cases
5) To get the total number of cases, we add up the cases in each level:
   1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30 cases.

Answer: 30
