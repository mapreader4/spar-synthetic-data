Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each 60-watt bulb uses 60 watts of power per day.
2) Allyn has 40 such bulbs in his house.
3) So the total power used per day is:
   * 40 bulbs x 60 watts per bulb = 2,400 watts per day
4) The electricity bill is 20 cents per power watt used.
5) There are 30 days in June.
6) So the total monthly expenses on electricity in June would be:
   * 2,400 watts per day x 30 days = 72,000 watts per month
   * 72,000 watts per month x $0.20 per watt = $14,400 per month

Answer: 14,400
