Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Vivienne has 40 phones.
2) Aliyah has 10 more phones than Vivienne, so Aliyah has 40 + 10 = 50 phones.
3) The two sisters are selling their phones at $400 each.
4) To calculate the total amount of money they have together, we need to multiply the number of phones each sister has by the price per phone, and then add the two amounts together.
5) Vivienne has 40 phones, so her total amount is 40 x $400 = $16,000.
6) Aliyah has 50 phones, so her total amount is 50 x $400 = $20,000.
7) The total amount of money the two sisters have together is $16,000 + $20,000 = $36,000.

Answer: 36,000
