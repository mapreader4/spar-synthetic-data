Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The store had profits of $1,500 in the first quarter, $3,000 in the third quarter, and $2,000 in the fourth quarter.
* The store's annual profits are $8,000.
* To find the profit made in the second quarter, we need to subtract the profits from the first, third, and fourth quarters from the total annual profits.
* Profits from first quarter: $1,500
* Profits from third quarter: $3,000
* Profits from fourth quarter: $2,000
* Total profits from first, third, and fourth quarters: $1,500 + $3,000 + $2,000 = $6,500
* Annual profits: $8,000
* Profits from second quarter = Annual profits - Profits from first, third, and fourth quarters
* Profits from second quarter = $8,000 - $6,500 = $1,500

Answer: $1,500
