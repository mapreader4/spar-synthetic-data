Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Franzia wine is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi.
2) The Carlo Rosi is 40 years old.
3) Therefore, the Franzia wine is 3 x 40 = 120 years old.
4) The Carlo Rosi is four times older than the Twin Valley.
5) Therefore, the Twin Valley is 40 / 4 = 10 years old.
6) The total age of the three brands of wine is the sum of their individual ages:
   Franzia: 120 years
   Carlo Rosi: 40 years
   Twin Valley: 10 years
   Total: 120 + 40 + 10 = 170 years

Answer: 170
