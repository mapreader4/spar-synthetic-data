Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each frog needs to eat 30 flies per day to live.
2) Each fish needs to eat 8 frogs per day to live.
3) Each gharial needs to eat 15 fish a day to live.
4) There are 9 gharials in the swamp.
5) To find the total number of flies eaten every day, we need to work backwards from the gharials.
6) Each gharial eats 15 fish per day, so the total number of fish eaten by the 9 gharials is 9 * 15 = 135 fish per day.
7) Each fish eats 8 frogs per day, so the total number of frogs eaten by the 135 fish is 135 * 8 = 1,080 frogs per day.
8) Each frog eats 30 flies per day, so the total number of flies eaten by the 1,080 frogs is 1,080 * 30 = 32,400 flies per day.

Answer: 32,400
