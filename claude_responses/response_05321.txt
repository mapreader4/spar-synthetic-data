Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Julia adopted the puppy for $20.00.
2. She needs to buy:
   - A bag of dog food for $20.00
   - 2 bags of treats for $2.50 each, so 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
   - An assortment box of toys for $15.00
   - A crate and a bed for $20.00 each, so 2 * $20.00 = $40.00
   - A collar/leash combo for $15.00
3. The total of all these items is:
   $20.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 + $15.00 + $40.00 + $15.00 = $115.00
4. The store offered a 20% new-customer discount, so the total amount Julia will spend is:
   $115.00 - (20% of $115.00) = $115.00 - $23.00 = $92.00

Answer: $92
