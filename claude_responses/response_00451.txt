Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys a box of 40 light bulbs.
2) He uses 16 of them.
3) That leaves him with 40 - 16 = 24 light bulbs remaining.
4) He then gives half of the remaining 24 light bulbs to a friend.
5) Half of 24 is 12.
6) So he gives 12 light bulbs to his friend.
7) That leaves him with 24 - 12 = 12 light bulbs left.

Answer: 12
