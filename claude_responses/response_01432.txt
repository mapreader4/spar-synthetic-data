Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Venny spent $15,000 on a used car.
2) The used car cost 40% of the original price.
3) To find the original price, we need to find the value that 40% of is equal to $15,000.
4) We can set up the equation: 0.40 * x = $15,000
5) Solving for x, we get: x = $15,000 / 0.40 = $37,500
Answer: $37,500
