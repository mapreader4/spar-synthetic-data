Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miriam has five times as many albums as Katrina
* Katrina has six times the number of albums as Bridget
* Bridget has 15 fewer albums than Adele
* Adele has 30 albums

First, let's find out how many albums Bridget has:
* Bridget has 15 fewer albums than Adele
* Adele has 30 albums
* Therefore, Bridget has 30 - 15 = 15 albums

Next, let's find out how many albums Katrina has:
* Katrina has six times the number of albums as Bridget
* Bridget has 15 albums
* Therefore, Katrina has 6 x 15 = 90 albums

Finally, let's find out how many albums Miriam has:
* Miriam has five times as many albums as Katrina
* Katrina has 90 albums
* Therefore, Miriam has 5 x 90 = 450 albums

Now, to find the total number of albums they have together:
* Adele has 30 albums
* Bridget has 15 albums
* Katrina has 90 albums
* Miriam has 450 albums
* Total albums = 30 + 15 + 90 + 450 = 585

Answer: 585
