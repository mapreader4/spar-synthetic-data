Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses.
2) Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins.
   * This means that Governor Hawkins gave 12 / 2 = 6 commencement addresses.
3) Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval.
   * This means that Governor Sloan gave 12 + 10 = 22 commencement addresses.
4) To find the total number of commencement addresses given by the three governors, we add up their individual totals:
   * Governor Sandoval: 12
   * Governor Hawkins: 6
   * Governor Sloan: 22
   * Total: 12 + 6 + 22 = 40

Answer: 40
