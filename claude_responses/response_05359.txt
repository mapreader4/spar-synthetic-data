Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cassie tries to drink at least 12 cups of water a day
* 1 cup = 8 ounces of water
* Cassie's water bottle holds 16 ounces
* To calculate how many times Cassie needs to refill her water bottle, we need to find out how many 16-ounce bottles are needed to make 12 cups

First, let's calculate how many ounces of water are needed for 12 cups:
* 12 cups x 8 ounces/cup = 96 ounces of water

Now, let's calculate how many 16-ounce bottles are needed to make 96 ounces:
* 96 ounces / 16 ounces per bottle = 6 bottles

Therefore, Cassie needs to refill her water bottle 6 times a day to make sure she drinks 12 cups of water.
