Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Darry climbs his full ladder, which has 11 steps, 10 times today.
* So for the full ladder, he climbed 11 steps x 10 times = 110 steps.
* Darry also climbs his smaller ladder, which has 6 steps, 7 times today.
* So for the smaller ladder, he climbed 6 steps x 7 times = 42 steps.
* In total, Darry climbed 110 steps on the full ladder + 42 steps on the smaller ladder.
* Therefore, the total number of steps Darry climbed today is:
