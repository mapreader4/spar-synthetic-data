Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ginger sold 10 lilacs on Tuesday
* She sold three times more roses than lilacs
* So, if she sold 10 lilacs, she sold 3 x 10 = 30 roses
* She sold half as many gardenias as lilacs
* So, if she sold 10 lilacs, she sold 1/2 x 10 = 5 gardenias

Now, to find the total number of flowers sold on Tuesday, we add up the number of roses, lilacs, and gardenias:
* Total flowers sold = 30 roses + 10 lilacs + 5 gardenias
* Total flowers sold = 30 + 10 + 5 = 45

Answer: 45
