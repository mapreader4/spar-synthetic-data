Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yesterday, Uncle Jerry reaped 120 tomatoes
* Today, he reaped 50 more tomatoes than yesterday
* To find the total number of tomatoes reaped, we need to add the number of tomatoes reaped yesterday and the number of tomatoes reaped today

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes reaped today:
* Yesterday, he reaped 120 tomatoes
* Today, he reaped 50 more than yesterday
* So, today he reaped 120 + 50 = 170 tomatoes

Now, to find the total number of tomatoes reaped, we add the number of tomatoes reaped yesterday and today:
* Yesterday: 120 tomatoes
* Today: 170 tomatoes
* Total: 120 + 170 = 290 tomatoes

Answer: 290
