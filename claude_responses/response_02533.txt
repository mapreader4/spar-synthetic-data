Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt's family includes:
  - Matt's mom and dad
  - Matt's older brother and his wife
  - 4 kids from Matt's older brother's family
* Matt's Uncle Joe and his wife are also coming, and they have 3 kids
* The house can only sleep 4 people
* Everyone else will sleep 2 to a tent outside

So, we need to calculate the total number of people who will be staying at the lake house:
* Matt's family: 2 parents + 2 adults (brother and wife) + 4 kids = 8 people
* Uncle Joe's family: 2 adults + 3 kids = 5 people
* Total people: 8 + 5 = 13 people

The house can only sleep 4 people, so the remaining 9 people will need to sleep in tents outside.

To calculate the number of tents needed, we know that each tent can sleep 2 people. So, we need to divide the number of people sleeping in tents by 2 to get the number of tents needed.

* Number of people sleeping in tents: 9
* Number of tents needed: 9 / 2 = 4.5 (rounded up to 5 tents)

Answer: 5 tents
