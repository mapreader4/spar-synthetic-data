Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. T-shirt cost: $20 each
2. Pants cost: $80 per pair
3. Shoes cost: $150 per pair
4. All items get a 10% discount

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:
* 4 T-shirts at $20 each = $80
* 3 pairs of pants at $80 each = $240
* 2 pairs of shoes at $150 each = $300
* Total before discount = $80 + $240 + $300 = $620

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
* Discount amount = 10% of $620 = 0.1 * $620 = $62
* Total cost after discount = $620 - $62 = $558

Therefore, the amount Eugene has to pay is:
Answer: $558
