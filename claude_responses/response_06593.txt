Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 4 carriages in a train.
2) Each carriage has 25 seats.
3) If each carriage could accommodate 10 more passengers, that means each carriage can hold 25 + 10 = 35 passengers.
4) So the total number of passengers that can fit in one train is 4 carriages x 35 passengers per carriage = 140 passengers.
5) The question asks how many passengers would fill up 3 trains.
6) Since each train can hold 140 passengers, 3 trains can hold 3 x 140 = 420 passengers.

Answer: 420
