Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The hobby store normally sells 21,122 trading cards per month.
2) In June, the hobby store sold 3,922 more trading cards than normal.
3) To find the number of trading cards sold in June, we add the normal amount (21,122) and the additional amount (3,922):
21,122 + 3,922 = 25,044 trading cards sold in June.
4) In July, the hobby store sold the regular number of trading cards, which is 21,122.
5) To find the total number of trading cards sold in June and July combined, we add the June and July amounts:
25,044 + 21,122 = 46,166 trading cards.

Answer: 46,166
