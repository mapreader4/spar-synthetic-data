Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the area of the first TV:
   * Width: 24 inches
   * Height: 16 inches
   * Area = Width x Height = 24 inches x 16 inches = 384 square inches

2. Calculate the cost per square inch of the first TV:
   * Cost of the first TV: $672
   * Cost per square inch = Cost / Area = $672 / 384 square inches = $1.75 per square inch

3. Calculate the area of the new TV:
   * Width: 48 inches
   * Height: 32 inches
   * Area = Width x Height = 48 inches x 32 inches = 1,536 square inches

4. Calculate the cost per square inch of the new TV:
   * Cost of the new TV: $1,152
   * Cost per square inch = Cost / Area = $1,152 / 1,536 square inches = $0.75 per square inch

5. Calculate the difference in cost per square inch between the two TVs:
   * Difference in cost per square inch = Cost per square inch of first TV - Cost per square inch of new TV
   * Difference in cost per square inch = $1.75 - $0.75 = $1.00 per square inch

Answer: $1.00 per square inch
