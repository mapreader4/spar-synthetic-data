Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The English exam has 30 questions and the Math exam has 15 questions.
2) The English exam is to be completed in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
3) The Math exam is to be completed in 1.5 hours, which is 90 minutes.
4) To find the time spent on each question, we divide the total time by the number of questions:
   - English exam: 60 minutes / 30 questions = 2 minutes per question
   - Math exam: 90 minutes / 15 questions = 6 minutes per question
5) The difference in time spent on each question is:
   - 6 minutes per question (Math exam) - 2 minutes per question (English exam) = 4 minutes
