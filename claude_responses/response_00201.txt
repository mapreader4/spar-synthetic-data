Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. For the first two weeks, Archibald eats 1 apple a day.
   * In the first two weeks, he eats 1 apple per day for 14 days.
   * So, in the first two weeks, he eats 1 * 14 = 14 apples.

2. For the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks.
   * In the first two weeks, he ate 14 apples.
   * So, in the next three weeks, he also eats 14 apples.
   * The total number of apples eaten in the first 5 weeks is 14 + 14 = 28 apples.

3. For the final two weeks, he eats 3 apples a day.
   * In the final two weeks, he eats 3 apples per day for 14 days.
   * So, in the final two weeks, he eats 3 * 14 = 42 apples.

4. The total number of apples eaten over the 7 weeks is 28 + 42 = 70 apples.

5. To calculate the average number of apples per week, we divide the total number of apples (70) by the number of weeks (7).
