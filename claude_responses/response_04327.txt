Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Samuel and Kevin have a total budget of $20 for their outing
* Samuel buys a $14 ticket and spends $6 on drinks and food
* So Samuel's total spending is $14 + $6 = $20
* Kevin buys a ticket and spends $2 on drinks
* Since they have both used their entire budget, we can calculate Kevin's spending on food by subtracting Samuel's total spending and Kevin's spending on drinks from the total budget:
* Total budget = $20
* Samuel's total spending = $20
* Kevin's spending on drinks = $2
* Kevin's spending on food = Total budget - Samuel's total spending - Kevin's spending on drinks
* Kevin's spending on food = $20 - $20 - $2 = -$2

Therefore, the amount Kevin spent on food is $0.
