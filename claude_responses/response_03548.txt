Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The lot measures 120 feet by 60 feet, which means the total area of the lot is 120 x 60 = 7,200 square feet.
2) The concrete section measures 40 feet by 40 feet, which means the area of the concrete section is 40 x 40 = 1,600 square feet.
3) The remaining area that needs to be covered in grass seeds is the total area of the lot (7,200 square feet) minus the area of the concrete section (1,600 square feet), which is 7,200 - 1,600 = 5,600 square feet.
4) Each bag of grass seeds covers 56 square feet.
5) To calculate the number of bags of grass seeds needed, we divide the remaining area that needs to be covered (5,600 square feet) by the area covered by each bag (56 square feet).
6) 5,600 square feet / 56 square feet per bag = 100 bags.

Answer: 100 bags.
