Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The base of the hill is 300m above the seabed
* This depth (300m) is a quarter of the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill
* To find the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill, we need to multiply the depth (300m) by 4, since it is a quarter of this distance
* 300m x 4 = 1200m
* Therefore, the height of the hill is 1200m

Answer: 1200
