Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are a certain number of drunk drivers in the traffic class
* The number of speeders is 3 less than 7 times the number of drunk drivers
* Let's call the number of drunk drivers 'x'
* Then the number of speeders is 7x - 3
* The total number of students in the class is 45
* So we can write the equation:
x + (7x - 3) = 45
* Solving for x:
8x - 3 = 45
8x = 48
x = 6

Answer: 6
