Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lindsey bought 2 exercise bands, and each band adds 5 pounds of resistance.
2) So the total resistance from the 2 bands is 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.
3) Lindsey doubles up both sets of bands, so the total resistance from the bands is now 2 x 10 = 20 pounds.
4) Lindsey also picks up a 10-pound dumbbell.
5) Therefore, the total weight she will squat is the resistance from the bands (20 pounds) plus the weight of the dumbbell (10 pounds).

Answer: 30 pounds.
