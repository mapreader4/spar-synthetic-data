Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 7 puppies and 6 kittens at the pet store.
* 2 puppies and 3 kittens were sold.
* To find the number of pets remaining, we need to subtract the number of pets sold from the initial number of pets.
* The number of pets sold is 2 puppies + 3 kittens = 5 pets.
* The initial number of pets was 7 puppies + 6 kittens = 13 pets.
* The number of pets remaining is 13 pets - 5 pets sold = 8 pets.
