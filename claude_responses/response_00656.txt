Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Zig wrote 4 times as many books as Flo.
2) Zig wrote 60 books.
3) Since Zig wrote 4 times as many books as Flo, we can divide Zig's total of 60 books by 4 to find out how many books Flo wrote.
4) 60 books / 4 = 15 books
5) Therefore, Flo wrote 15 books.
6) To find the total number of books they wrote altogether, we add Zig's 60 books and Flo's 15 books:
60 books + 15 books = 75 books

Answer: 75
