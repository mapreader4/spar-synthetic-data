Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Fatima has a piece of cloth that is 100 square inches.
2) She decides to cut the cloth in half. This means she will have two pieces of cloth, each 50 square inches.
3) She plans on keeping one half (50 square inches) and donating the other half (50 square inches).
4) She does this process 2 times.
5) In the first iteration, she donates 50 square inches.
6) In the second iteration, she donates another 50 square inches.
7) In total, she has donated 50 + 50 = 100 square inches of cloth.
