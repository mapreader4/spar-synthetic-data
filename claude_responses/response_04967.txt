Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The tank starts with a maximum capacity of 350,000 gallons of water.
2) For the first 5 hours, the tank is losing 32,000 gallons/hour.
   * So, in the first 5 hours, the tank loses 32,000 * 5 = 160,000 gallons.
3) After the first 5 hours, the tank is still losing 10,000 gallons/hour for 10 hours.
   * So, in the next 10 hours, the tank loses 10,000 * 10 = 100,000 gallons.
4) In total, the tank has lost 160,000 + 100,000 = 260,000 gallons.
5) The company then starts filling the tank at a rate of 40,000 gallons/hour for 3 hours.
   * So, the tank gains 40,000 * 3 = 120,000 gallons.
6) The maximum capacity of the tank is 350,000 gallons.
   * The tank has lost 260,000 gallons and gained 120,000 gallons.
   * So, the tank is missing 350,000 - (260,000 - 120,000) = 210,000 gallons to be at maximum capacity again.

Answer: 210,000 gallons
