Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Before losing one, Policeman O'Brien had 5 more than twice as many hats as fire chief Simpson.
2) Fire chief Simpson has 15 hats.
3) To find how many hats Policeman O'Brien had before losing one, we first need to find twice the number of hats that fire chief Simpson has.
4) Twice the number of hats that fire chief Simpson has is 2 * 15 = 30.
5) Policeman O'Brien had 5 more than this, so he had 30 + 5 = 35 hats before losing one.
6) Now, Policeman O'Brien has lost one hat, so he has 35 - 1 = 34 hats.

Answer: 34
