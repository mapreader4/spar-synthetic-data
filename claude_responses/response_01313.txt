Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Frank has already spent 45 minutes in the current corn maze.
2) He has done 4 other corn mazes, and finished those in 50 minutes on average.
3) He wants to ensure that his average time per maze doesn't go above 60 minutes.
4) To calculate the total time he can spend in the current maze, we need to find the maximum total time he can spend across all 5 mazes.
5) The maximum total time he can spend across all 5 mazes is 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.
6) The time he has already spent in the 4 previous mazes is 4 * 50 = 200 minutes.
7) The time he has already spent in the current maze is 45 minutes.
8) The maximum time he can still spend in the current maze is 300 - 200 - 45 = 55 minutes.

Answer: 55 minutes
