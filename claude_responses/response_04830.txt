Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martha spends 10 minutes turning the router off and on again.
2) She spends six times as long on hold with Comcast. So, 6 x 10 minutes = 60 minutes on hold with Comcast.
3) She spends half as much time yelling at a customer service representative as she did on hold with Comcast. So, 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes yelling at a customer service representative.

Now, to calculate the total time spent on these activities:
Total time = 10 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 100 minutes.

Answer: 100
