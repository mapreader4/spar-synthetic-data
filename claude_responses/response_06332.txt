Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lillian found 32 mushrooms in total
* She identified 9 mushrooms as safe to eat
* She identified twice the amount she ate (9) as poisonous, which is 18 mushrooms
* That leaves a remaining number of mushrooms that she was uncertain about

To find the number of mushrooms she was uncertain about, we can subtract the number of safe mushrooms and the number of poisonous mushrooms from the total number of mushrooms:
* Total mushrooms: 32
* Safe mushrooms: 9
* Poisonous mushrooms: 18
* Uncertain mushrooms: 32 - 9 - 18 = 5
