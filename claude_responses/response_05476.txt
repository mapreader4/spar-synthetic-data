Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The pizza cost is $12 per pizza.
2. The delivery charge is an additional $2 if the area is farther than 1 km from the pizzeria.
3. Jimmy delivered 3 pizzas in the park, which is 100 meters away from the pizzeria. Since this is less than 1 km, there is no additional delivery charge.
   * Cost of 3 pizzas in the park: 3 x $12 = $36
4. Jimmy delivered 2 pizzas in a building 2 km away from the pizzeria. Since this is farther than 1 km, there is an additional $2 delivery charge per pizza.
   * Cost of 2 pizzas in the building: 2 x $12 = $24
   * Delivery charge for the 2 pizzas: 2 x $2 = $4
   * Total cost for the 2 pizzas in the building: $24 + $4 = $28

Now, to calculate the total amount Jimmy got paid:
* Total amount paid = Cost of 3 pizzas in the park + Cost of 2 pizzas in the building
* Total amount paid = $36 + $28 = $64

Answer: $64
