Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob buys 10 nose sprays
* The promotion is "buy one get one free"
* Each nose spray costs $3

To calculate the total cost, we need to determine how many nose sprays Bob is actually paying for.

Since the promotion is "buy one get one free", Bob is only paying for 5 of the 10 nose sprays.

The total cost would be:
* 5 nose sprays x $3 per nose spray = $15

Therefore, the total amount Bob pays is:
Answer: 15
