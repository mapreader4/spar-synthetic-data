Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The deck is 30 feet by 40 feet.
2) The area of the deck is 30 feet x 40 feet = 1,200 square feet.
3) The cost of the deck, without the sealant, is 1,200 square feet x $3 per square foot = $3,600.
4) The cost of the sealant is 1,200 square feet x $1 per square foot = $1,200.
5) The total cost of the deck, including the sealant, is $3,600 + $1,200 = $4,800.

Answer: $4,800.
