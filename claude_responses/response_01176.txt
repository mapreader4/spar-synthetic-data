Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Paula wants to ride the go-karts 1 time
* It costs 4 tickets to ride the go-karts
* So for the go-karts, Paula needs 4 tickets
* Paula also wants to ride the bumper cars 4 times
* It costs 5 tickets to ride the bumper cars
* So for the bumper cars, Paula needs 4 * 5 = 20 tickets
* To get the total number of tickets Paula needs, we add the tickets for the go-karts and the bumper cars:
* 4 + 20 = 24 tickets
