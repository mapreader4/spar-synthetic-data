Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The garden produced 237 potatoes.
2) The garden produced 60 fewer cucumbers than potatoes. So, the number of cucumbers is 237 - 60 = 177.
3) The garden produced twice as many peppers as cucumbers. So, the number of peppers is 2 * 177 = 354.
4) To find the total number of vegetables produced, we add the number of potatoes, cucumbers, and peppers:
237 + 177 + 354 = 768.

Answer: 768
