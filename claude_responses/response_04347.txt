Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Braelynn has 24 knives in her kitchen.
2) She has twice as many teaspoons as knives, so she has 24 x 2 = 48 teaspoons.
3) She bought 1/3 as many additional knives, so she bought 24 x 1/3 = 8 additional knives.
4) She bought 2/3 as many additional teaspoons, so she bought 48 x 2/3 = 32 additional teaspoons.
5) The total number of knives she has now is 24 + 8 = 32 knives.
6) The total number of teaspoons she has now is 48 + 32 = 80 teaspoons.
7) The total number of cutlery pieces she has in her kitchen is 32 knives + 80 teaspoons = 112 pieces.

Answer: 112
