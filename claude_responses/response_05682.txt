Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Enrique sells 2 suits at $700.00 each. The total sales for the suits is:
   2 suits x $700.00 = $1,400.00

2. Enrique sells 6 shirts at $50.00 each. The total sales for the shirts is:
   6 shirts x $50.00 = $300.00

3. Enrique sells 2 pairs of loafers at $150.00 each. The total sales for the loafers is:
   2 pairs x $150.00 = $300.00

4. The total sales for the day is the sum of the sales for the suits, shirts, and loafers:
   $1,400.00 + $300.00 + $300.00 = $2,000.00

5. Enrique earns a 15% commission on the total sales. To calculate the commission, we multiply the total sales by 0.15 (15% expressed as a decimal):
   $2,000.00 x 0.15 = $300.00

Answer: $300.00
