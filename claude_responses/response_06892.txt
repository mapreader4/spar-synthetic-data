Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sadie has 140 math homework problems for the week
* 40% of the problems are Algebra problems
* To find the number of Algebra problems, we take 40% of 140:
    * 40% of 140 = 0.40 * 140 = 56 Algebra problems
* Half of the Algebra problems are solving linear equations
* To find the number of solving linear equations problems, we take half of the Algebra problems:
    * Half of 56 = 56 / 2 = 28 solving linear equations problems

Answer: 28
