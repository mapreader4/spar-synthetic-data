Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ed has 2 dogs
* Ed has 3 cats
* Ed has twice as many fish as cats and dogs combined
* To find the number of cats and dogs combined, we add 2 (dogs) and 3 (cats) to get 5
* Since Ed has twice as many fish as cats and dogs combined, and there are 5 cats and dogs combined, he has 2 x 5 = 10 fish
* To find the total number of pets Ed has, we add the number of dogs, cats, and fish:
* 2 dogs + 3 cats + 10 fish = 15 pets

Answer: 15
