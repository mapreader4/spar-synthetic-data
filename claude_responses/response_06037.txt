Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James finds 3 bills in his pocket
* Each bill is a $20 bill
* So the total amount of money he found in his pocket is:
  * 3 bills x $20 per bill = $60
* He already had $75 in his wallet
* To find the total amount of money he has now, we add the $60 he found in his pocket to the $75 he already had in his wallet:
  * $60 + $75 = $135

Answer: 135
