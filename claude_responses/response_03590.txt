Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hallie read 63 pages on the first day.
* On the second day, she read twice the number of pages that she'd read on day one, which is 2 * 63 = 126 pages.
* On the third day, she read 10 more pages than she read on day two, which is 126 + 10 = 136 pages.
* The book is 354 pages long.
* To find the number of pages she read on the fourth day, we need to subtract the total number of pages she read on the first three days from the total number of pages in the book.
* Total pages read on first three days: 63 + 126 + 136 = 325 pages.
* Pages remaining to be read on the fourth day: 354 - 325 = 29 pages.

Answer: 29
