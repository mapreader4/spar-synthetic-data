Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 28 students on the bus
* After stopping at the intersection, there were 58 students on the bus
* This means that 58 - 28 = 30 students entered the bus at the intermediate stop
* We are asked to find 40% of the number of students who entered the bus at the intermediate stop
* 40% of 30 is 0.4 * 30 = 12

Answer: 12
