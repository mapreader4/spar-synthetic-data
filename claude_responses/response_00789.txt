Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James' injury took 3 days for the pain to subside.
2) The injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal, which is 3 days x 5 = 15 days.
3) After the 15 days, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.
4) So the total time until he could start working out again is 15 days + 3 days = 18 days.
5) He then wanted to wait 3 weeks (21 days) after starting to work out again before he could start lifting heavy.
6) Therefore, the total time until he can lift heavy again is 18 days + 21 days = 39 days.

Answer: 39 days
