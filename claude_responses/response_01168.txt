Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Arwen was able to get 20 tulips.
2) Elrond was able to get twice as many tulips as Arwen did.
3) To find how many tulips Elrond got, we multiply Arwen's 20 tulips by 2:
   20 tulips x 2 = 40 tulips
4) To find the total number of tulips they got, we add Arwen's 20 tulips and Elrond's 40 tulips:
   20 tulips + 40 tulips = 60 tulips

Answer: 60
