Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenn has 5 jars full of quarters.
2) Each jar can hold 160 quarters.
3) So the total number of quarters Jenn has is:
   5 jars x 160 quarters per jar = 800 quarters
4) Each quarter is worth $0.25.
5) So the total amount of money Jenn has is:
   800 quarters x $0.25 per quarter = $200
6) The bike costs $180.
7) To find the amount of money Jenn will have left over, we subtract the cost of the bike from the total amount of money she has:
   $200 - $180 = $20

Answer: $20
