Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dabbie bought 3 turkeys for Thanksgiving
* The first turkey weighs 6 kilograms
* The second turkey weighs 9 kilograms
* The third turkey weighs twice the weight of the second turkey, which is 2 x 9 = 18 kilograms
* The cost of a kilogram of turkey is $2

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the total weight of all the turkeys
2. Multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram

Total weight of the turkeys:
* First turkey: 6 kg
* Second turkey: 9 kg
* Third turkey: 18 kg
* Total weight = 6 + 9 + 18 = 33 kg

Total cost:
* 33 kg x $2 per kg = $66

Answer: $66
