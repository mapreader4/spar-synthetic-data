Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We start with a box of 6 popsicles.
2) The first popsicle melts at a certain rate.
3) Each subsequent popsicle melts twice as fast as the previous one.
4) So the second popsicle melts at 2 times the rate of the first popsicle.
5) The third popsicle melts at 2 times the rate of the second popsicle, which is 2^2 = 4 times the rate of the first popsicle.
6) The fourth popsicle melts at 2 times the rate of the third popsicle, which is 2^3 = 8 times the rate of the first popsicle.
7) The fifth popsicle melts at 2 times the rate of the fourth popsicle, which is 2^4 = 16 times the rate of the first popsicle.
8) The sixth (and last) popsicle melts at 2 times the rate of the fifth popsicle, which is 2^5 = 32 times the rate of the first popsicle.

Answer: 32
