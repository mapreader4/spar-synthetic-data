Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that in 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age.
2) Ernesto is currently 11 years old.
3) In 3 years, Ernesto will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.
4) In 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age, which is 14 / 2 = 7 years old.
5) Therefore, Jayden is currently 7 - 3 = 4 years old.
