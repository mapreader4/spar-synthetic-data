Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom's deck has 19 rare cards, each costing $1
* So the total cost of the rare cards is 19 * $1 = $19
* The deck also has 11 uncommon cards, each costing $0.50
* So the total cost of the uncommon cards is 11 * $0.50 = $5.50
* Finally, the deck has 30 common cards, each costing $0.25
* So the total cost of the common cards is 30 * $0.25 = $7.50
* To calculate the total cost of the deck, we add up the costs of the rare, uncommon, and common cards:
* $19 + $5.50 + $7.50 = $32
