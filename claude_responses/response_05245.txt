Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John makes 6 dozen cookies, which is 6 x 12 = 72 cookies.
2) He sells each cookie for $1.5, so the total revenue is 72 x $1.5 = $108.
3) Each cookie costs $0.25 to make, so the total cost is 72 x $0.25 = $18.
4) The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $108 - $18 = $90.
5) John splits the profit between two charities evenly, so each charity gets half of the profit, which is $90 / 2 = $45.

Answer: $45
