Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cersei bought 50 cotton candies.
2) She gave her brother and sister 5 cotton candies each, so that's 10 cotton candies given away.
3) She then gave one-fourth of the remaining cotton candies to her cousin. The remaining cotton candies after giving away 10 is 50 - 10 = 40. One-fourth of 40 is 10, so she gave her cousin 10 cotton candies.
4) Cersei ate 12 cotton candies herself.
5) So the total number of cotton candies given away is 10 + 10 + 12 = 32.
6) The original 50 cotton candies minus the 32 given away leaves 18 cotton candies remaining.

Answer: 18
