Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jimmy eats 7 cookies
* Each cookie contains 50 calories
* So, the total calories from the 7 cookies is:
7 cookies x 50 calories/cookie = 350 calories

* Now, we need to find how many crackers Jimmy needs to eat to reach a total of 500 calories
* Each cracker contains 15 calories
* The remaining calories needed is 500 - 350 = 150 calories
* To find the number of crackers needed, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per cracker:
150 calories / 15 calories/cracker = 10 crackers

Answer: 10 crackers
