Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Tim bought the car for $20,000.
2) The car goes down in value by $1,000 per year.
3) We want to find the value of the car after 6 years.
4) After 1 year, the car is worth $20,000 - $1,000 = $19,000.
5) After 2 years, the car is worth $19,000 - $1,000 = $18,000.
6) After 3 years, the car is worth $18,000 - $1,000 = $17,000.
7) After 4 years, the car is worth $17,000 - $1,000 = $16,000.
8) After 5 years, the car is worth $16,000 - $1,000 = $15,000.
9) After 6 years, the car is worth $15,000 - $1,000 = $14,000.

Answer: 14,000
