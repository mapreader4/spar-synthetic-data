Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread
* He needs 4 pounds of flour per loaf
* So, the total amount of flour needed is 12 loaves x 4 pounds/loaf = 48 pounds of flour
* The 10-pound bag of flour costs $10, so the cost per pound is $10 / 10 pounds = $1 per pound
* The 12-pound bag of flour costs $13, so the cost per pound is $13 / 12 pounds = $1.08 per pound
* Since the 10-pound bag of flour is cheaper per pound, Tommy should buy the 10-pound bags to get the 48 pounds of flour he needs
* He will need to buy 5 bags of 10-pound flour (5 x 10 pounds = 50 pounds)
* The total cost of the 5 bags of 10-pound flour is 5 x $10 = $50

Answer: $50
