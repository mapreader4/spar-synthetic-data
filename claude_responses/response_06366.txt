Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elsa started the day with 40 marbles
* At breakfast, she lost 3 marbles while playing
* So, she now has 40 - 3 = 37 marbles
* At lunchtime, she gave her best friend Susie 5 marbles
* So, she now has 37 - 5 = 32 marbles
* In the afternoon, Elsa's mom bought her a new bag with 12 marbles
* So, she now has 32 + 12 = 44 marbles
* Susie came back and gave Elsa twice as many marbles as she received at lunch
* Susie gave Elsa 2 * 5 = 10 marbles
* So, Elsa now has 44 + 10 = 54 marbles

Answer: 54
