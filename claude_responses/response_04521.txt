Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John gets a new EpiPen every 6 months
* Each EpiPen costs $500
* Insurance covers 75% of the cost

To calculate how much John pays per year, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of an EpiPen
2. Calculate how much insurance covers
3. Calculate how much John pays for each EpiPen
4. Calculate how many EpiPens John needs per year
5. Multiply the amount John pays per EpiPen by the number of EpiPens per year

1. Total cost of an EpiPen: $500
2. Amount covered by insurance: 75% of $500 = $375
3. Amount John pays per EpiPen: $500 - $375 = $125
4. Number of EpiPens per year: 12 months / 6 months = 2 EpiPens per year
5. Total amount John pays per year: $125 x 2 = $250

Answer: $250
