Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marcia buys 12 apples at $2 each, so the total cost of the apples is 12 * $2 = $24.
2) Marcia buys 4 bananas at $1 each, so the total cost of the bananas is 4 * $1 = $4.
3) Marcia buys 4 oranges at $3 each, so the total cost of the oranges is 4 * $3 = $12.
4) The total cost of all the fruit is $24 + $4 + $12 = $40.
5) Marcia bought a total of 12 + 4 + 4 = 20 pieces of fruit.
6) To calculate the average cost of each piece of fruit, we divide the total cost ($40) by the total number of pieces of fruit (20).
Answer: $2
