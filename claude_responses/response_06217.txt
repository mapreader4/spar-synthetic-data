Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Levi has 5 lemons.
2) Jayden has 6 more lemons than Levi, so Jayden has 5 + 6 = 11 lemons.
3) Jayden has one-third as many lemons as Eli, so Eli has 3 times as many lemons as Jayden, which is 3 * 11 = 33 lemons.
4) Eli has one-half as many lemons as Ian, so Ian has 2 times as many lemons as Eli, which is 2 * 33 = 66 lemons.
5) To find the total number of lemons, we add up the lemons of each person:
Levi: 5 lemons
Jayden: 11 lemons
Eli: 33 lemons
Ian: 66 lemons
Total: 5 + 11 + 33 + 66 = 115 lemons

Answer: 115
