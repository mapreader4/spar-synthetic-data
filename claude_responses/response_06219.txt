Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Theo and Tia invited two of their friends, so there are 4 people total
* They bought individual sandwiches and fruit salads for each person
* They bought 4 sandwiches at $5 each, so that's 4 * $5 = $20 for the sandwiches
* They bought 4 fruit salads at $3 each, so that's 4 * $3 = $12 for the fruit salads
* They bought 2 sodas per person, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 sodas at $2 each, which is 8 * $2 = $16 for the sodas
* They bought 3 bags of snacks at $4 each, so that's 3 * $4 = $12 for the snacks

Adding up all the costs:
* Sandwiches: $20
* Fruit Salads: $12
* Sodas: $16
* Snacks: $12
* Total: $20 + $12 + $16 + $12 = $60

Answer: $60
