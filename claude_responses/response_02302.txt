Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The price of the TV decreased by $35 each year.
2) The price in 2001 was $1950.
3) We need to find the price in 2009, which is 8 years after 2001.
4) Since the price decreased by $35 each year, in 8 years the total decrease would be 8 * $35 = $280.
5) The price in 2009 would be the original price in 2001 ($1950) minus the total decrease of $280.

Answer: $1670
