Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora
* Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton
* Zara is 64 inches tall and has the same height as Brixton

First, let's find Brixton's height:
* Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton
* Zara is 64 inches tall and has the same height as Brixton
* Therefore, Brixton's height is 64 inches

Next, let's find Itzayana's height:
* Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora
* Zora's height is 64 inches - 8 inches = 56 inches
* Therefore, Itzayana's height is 56 inches + 4 inches = 60 inches

Now, we can calculate the average height of the four people:
* Zara's height: 64 inches
* Brixton's height: 64 inches
* Itzayana's height: 60 inches
* Zora's height: 56 inches
* Average height = (64 + 64 + 60 + 56) / 4 = 244 / 4 = 61 inches

Answer: 61 inches
