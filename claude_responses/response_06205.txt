Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark starts with 100 friends
* He keeps 40% of his friends list
* 40% of 100 is 0.4 * 100 = 40 friends
* He contacts the remaining 60 friends
* Of those 60 friends, only 50% respond
* 50% of 60 is 0.5 * 60 = 30 friends respond
* He removes the 30 friends who did not respond
* So, the number of friends he has left is the 40 friends he kept plus the 30 friends who responded
* 40 + 30 = 70 friends

Answer: 70
