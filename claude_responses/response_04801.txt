Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom runs 5 days a week
* He runs 1.5 hours each day
* He runs at a speed of 8 mph

To calculate the total miles he runs in a week, we need to:
1. Calculate the distance he runs each day
2. Multiply the distance per day by the number of days per week

Step 1: Distance per day
* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 8 mph x 1.5 hours
* Distance = 12 miles per day

Step 2: Total distance per week
* Total distance = Distance per day x Days per week
* Total distance = 12 miles x 5 days
* Total distance = 60 miles

Answer: 60 miles
