Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alfred's goal is to save $1,000.00 over 12 months for his Christmas shopping
* He has $100.00 left over from last year's holiday to put towards this year's goal
* To calculate how much he needs to save each month, we need to:
  1. Subtract the $100.00 he has left over from the $1,000.00 goal
  2. Divide the remaining amount ($900.00) by the number of months (12)

Step 1: Subtract the $100.00 he has left over from the $1,000.00 goal
* $1,000.00 - $100.00 = $900.00

Step 2: Divide the remaining amount ($900.00) by the number of months (12)
* $900.00 / 12 = $75.00

Therefore, Alfred needs to save $75.00 each month in order to reach his $1,000.00 goal in 12 months.

Answer: $75
