Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alex has 600 meters of silk in storage
* Each dress requires 5 meters of silk
* Alex gives each of his 5 friends 20 meters of silk, so that's 5 * 20 = 100 meters of silk given away
* That leaves 600 - 100 = 500 meters of silk remaining for Alex to use to make dresses himself

Now, to calculate how many dresses Alex can make:
* Each dress requires 5 meters of silk
* With 500 meters of silk remaining, Alex can make 500 / 5 = 100 dresses

Answer: 100
