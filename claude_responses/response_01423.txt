Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) George traveled to 6 countries.
2) Joseph traveled to half the number of countries George traveled to. So, Joseph traveled to 6 / 2 = 3 countries.
3) Patrick traveled to three times the number of countries Joseph traveled to. So, Patrick traveled to 3 * 3 = 9 countries.
4) Zack has traveled to twice the number of countries Patrick traveled to. So, Zack traveled to 2 * 9 = 18 countries.

Answer: 18
