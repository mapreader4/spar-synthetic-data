Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jame gets 20 singing lessons in total
* The first lesson is free
* After the first 10 paid lessons, he only needs to pay for every other lesson
* Each lesson costs $5
* His uncle pays for half of the cost

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lessons:
* The first lesson is free, so that's $0
* The next 10 lessons cost $5 each, so that's 10 * $5 = $50
* After the first 10 lessons, he only pays for every other lesson, so that's 5 more lessons at $5 each, which is 5 * $5 = $25
* The total cost of the lessons is $50 + $25 = $75

Now, his uncle pays for half of the cost, so Jame pays the other half:
* Jame's share of the cost is $75 / 2 = $37.50

Answer: $38 (rounded to the nearest whole dollar)
