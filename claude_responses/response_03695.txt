Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Single layer cake slice costs $4
* Dusty buys 7 single layer cake slices
* So, the total cost of the single layer cake slices is 7 * $4 = $28
* Double layer cake slice costs $7
* Dusty buys 5 double layer cake slices
* So, the total cost of the double layer cake slices is 5 * $7 = $35
* The total cost of all the cake slices is $28 + $35 = $63
* Dusty pays with a $100 bill
* To calculate the change, we take the $100 bill and subtract the total cost of $63
* $100 - $63 = $37
* Answer: $37
