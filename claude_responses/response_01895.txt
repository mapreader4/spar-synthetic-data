Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, Natalia rode 40 kilometers.
2. On Tuesday, Natalia rode 50 kilometers.
3. On Wednesday, Natalia rode 50% fewer kilometers than the day before. 
   - The day before (Tuesday) she rode 50 kilometers.
   - 50% fewer kilometers means she rode 50% of 50 kilometers, which is 25 kilometers.

4. On Thursday, Natalia rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Wednesday.
   - On Monday she rode 40 kilometers.
   - On Wednesday she rode 25 kilometers.
   - The sum of these is 40 + 25 = 65 kilometers.

Now, to find the total kilometers Natalia rode, we add up the kilometers from each day:
Monday: 40 km
Tuesday: 50 km
Wednesday: 25 km
Thursday: 65 km

Total kilometers = 40 + 50 + 25 + 65 = 180 km

Answer: 180
