Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carl is having a party with 15 guests
* He wants to make sure everyone, including himself, has at least 2 glasses of punch
* Each glass holds 12 ounces of punch

To calculate the total number of ounces of punch needed, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of people attending the party, including Carl
2. Multiply the total number of people by the minimum number of glasses per person (2)
3. Multiply the total number of glasses by the ounces per glass (12)

Step 1: Total number of people attending the party
* 15 guests + 1 (Carl) = 16 people

Step 2: Total number of glasses needed
* 16 people x 2 glasses per person = 32 glasses

Step 3: Total ounces of punch needed
* 32 glasses x 12 ounces per glass = 384 ounces

Answer: 384 ounces
