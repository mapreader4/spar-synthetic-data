Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jonessa's pay is $500.
2) 10% of her pay goes to paying tax.
3) To calculate the tax amount, we take 10% of $500:
   * 10% of $500 = 0.10 x $500 = $50
4) To calculate her take-home pay, we subtract the tax amount from her total pay:
   * $500 - $50 = $450
Answer: $450
