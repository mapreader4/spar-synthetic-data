Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The total number of vehicles passing on the highway is 300.
2) The number of cars is twice the number of trucks.
3) Let's represent the number of trucks as x.
4) Then, the number of cars is 2x.
5) The total number of vehicles is the sum of the number of cars and the number of trucks:
   300 = 2x + x
   300 = 3x
6) Solving for x, we get:
   x = 100
Therefore, the total number of trucks on the highway is 100.

Answer: 100
