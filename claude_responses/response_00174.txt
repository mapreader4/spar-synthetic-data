Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Movie tickets cost $5 each on a Monday
* On a Wednesday, the tickets cost twice as much as on a Monday, which means they cost $10 each
* On a Saturday, the tickets cost five times as much as on a Monday, which means they cost $25 each

Now, we need to calculate how much Glenn spends on the two days he goes to the movie theater:
* On Wednesday, Glenn buys tickets, and each ticket costs $10
* On Saturday, Glenn buys tickets, and each ticket costs $25

To calculate the total amount Glenn spends, we need to add the cost of the Wednesday tickets and the Saturday tickets:
* Wednesday tickets: $10 per ticket
* Saturday tickets: $25 per ticket
* Total spent: $10 + $25 = $35

Answer: $35
