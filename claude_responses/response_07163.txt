Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

First Route:
* Malcolm walks uphill for 6 minutes
* He then walks along a path for twice the amount of time, which is 2 x 6 = 12 minutes
* He then finishes the journey in a third of the time it took to walk the first two stages, which is (6 + 12) / 3 = 6 minutes
* Total time for the first route: 6 + 12 + 6 = 24 minutes

Second Route:
* Malcolm walks along a flat path for 14 minutes
* He then finishes the walk in twice this amount of time, which is 2 x 14 = 28 minutes
* Total time for the second route: 14 + 28 = 42 minutes

Now, to find the difference in time between the two routes:
* Time for the second route - Time for the first route = 42 - 24 = 18 minutes

Answer: 18 minutes
