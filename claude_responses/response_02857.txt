Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dave bought 3 packs of white T-shirts
* Each pack of white T-shirts contains 6 shirts
* So, the total number of white T-shirts is 3 packs x 6 shirts per pack = 18 white T-shirts
* Dave also bought 2 packs of blue T-shirts
* Each pack of blue T-shirts contains 4 shirts
* So, the total number of blue T-shirts is 2 packs x 4 shirts per pack = 8 blue T-shirts
* To find the total number of T-shirts Dave bought, we add the white and blue T-shirts:
* 18 white T-shirts + 8 blue T-shirts = 26 T-shirts

Answer: 26
