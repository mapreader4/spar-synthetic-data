Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cost of wasted meat:
   * 20 pounds of meat at $5/pound
   * 20 pounds x $5/pound = $100

2. Cost of wasted fruits and vegetables:
   * 15 pounds of fruits and vegetables at $4/pound
   * 15 pounds x $4/pound = $60

3. Cost of wasted bread products:
   * 60 pounds of bread products at $1.50/pound
   * 60 pounds x $1.50/pound = $90

4. Cost of janitorial staff overtime:
   * 10 hours of time-and-a-half pay at $10/hour
   * 10 hours x $10/hour x 1.5 = $150

5. Total cost:
   * $100 + $60 + $90 + $150 = $400

6. Minimum wage:
   * $8 per hour

7. Hours James needs to work to pay for everything:
   * $400 / $8 per hour = 50 hours

Answer: 50 hours
