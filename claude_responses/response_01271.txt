Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dorothy is 15 years old, so she qualifies for the 30% discount on the regular ticket price of $10.
2) The discounted ticket price for Dorothy is $10 - (30% of $10) = $10 - $3 = $7.
3) Dorothy's younger brother, who is also 18 or younger, also qualifies for the 30% discount, so his ticket price is also $7.
4) Dorothy's parents and grandfather do not qualify for the discount, so their tickets are the regular price of $10 each.
5) The total cost of the tickets for the family is:
   - Dorothy: $7
   - Younger brother: $7
   - Parents (2 x $10): $20
   - Grandfather: $10
   - Total: $7 + $7 + $20 + $10 = $44
6) Dorothy currently has $70.
7) After the trip, Dorothy will have $70 - $44 = $26 remaining.

Answer: $26
