Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cameron has 400 A4 pieces of paper
* 40% of the papers did not print out to her desired quality
* We need to calculate the total number of valid documents

First, we need to find out how many papers did not print out to her desired quality:
* 40% of 400 = 0.40 * 400 = 160 papers

Now, we can find the number of valid documents by subtracting the invalid documents from the total number of papers:
* 400 - 160 = 240 valid documents

Answer: 240
