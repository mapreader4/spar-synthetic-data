Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Ibrahim wants to buy an MP3 player for 120 euros and a CD for 19 euros. So the total cost of his purchases is:
120 euros + 19 euros = 139 euros
2) Ibrahim has 55 euros in savings, and his father gives him 20 euros. So the total amount of money Ibrahim has is:
55 euros + 20 euros = 75 euros
3) To find how much money Ibrahim lacks, we subtract the total amount of money he has (75 euros) from the total cost of his purchases (139 euros):
139 euros - 75 euros = 64 euros
Answer: 64 euros
