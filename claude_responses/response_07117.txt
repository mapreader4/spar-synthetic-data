Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Jack ran up the first half of the hill in 19 seconds
* Jack finished the race 7 seconds before Jill
* Jill finished the race in 32 seconds

We can use this information to calculate how long it took Jack to run up the second half of the hill.

First, let's calculate how long it took Jack to complete the entire race:
* Jill finished the race in 32 seconds
* Jack finished 7 seconds before Jill
* So, Jack finished the race in 32 - 7 = 25 seconds

Now, we can calculate how long it took Jack to run up the second half of the hill:
* Jack ran up the first half of the hill in 19 seconds
* Jack ran up the entire hill in 25 seconds
* So, Jack ran up the second half of the hill in 25 - 19 = 6 seconds

Answer: 6 seconds
