Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Jeremy played a three-letter word on a triple word score.
2) The word earned him 30 points.
3) Before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at 1 point.
4) We need to find the value of the middle letter before the word score was tripled.
5) Let's call the value of the middle letter 'x'.
6) The total score before the triple word score was: 1 + x + 1 = 2 + x.
7) Since the total score was tripled, we have: 3(2 + x) = 30.
8) Solving for x, we get: 6 + 3x = 30, so 3x = 24, and x = 8.

Answer: 8
