Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emmanuel will stay in Guam for 10 days in December.
2) He has to use international data that would cost $3.50 per day.
3) To calculate the cost of the international data, we multiply the daily cost ($3.50) by the number of days (10):
$3.50 x 10 = $35
4) Emmanuel has been paying $175 per month for his regular plan.
Therefore, the total charges for Emmanuel in December will be:
Cost of international data: $35
Regular plan: $175
Total charges: $35 + $175 = $210
Answer: $210
