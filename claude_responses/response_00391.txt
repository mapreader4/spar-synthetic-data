Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science
* He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields, each taking 4 years
* So the total time for the 3 degrees is:
    - 4 years for the first degree
    - 4 years for the second degree
    - 4 years for the third degree
    - Total: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 years
* He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years
* So the total time Tony went to school to be an astronaut is:
    - 12 years for the 3 degrees
    - 2 years for the graduate degree in physics
    - Total: 12 + 2 = 14 years

Answer: 14 years
