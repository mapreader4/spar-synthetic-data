Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) For the first bag, the percentage of kernels that popped is:
(60 kernels popped / 75 total kernels) x 100 = 80%

2) For the second bag, the percentage of kernels that popped is: 
(42 kernels popped / 50 total kernels) x 100 = 84%

3) For the third bag, the percentage of kernels that popped is:
(82 kernels popped / 100 total kernels) x 100 = 82% 

To find the average percentage, we add up the three percentages and divide by 3:
(80% + 84% + 82%) / 3 = 82%

Answer: 82
