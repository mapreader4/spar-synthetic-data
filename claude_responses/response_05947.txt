Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Karina was born in 1970.
2) Karina is currently 40 years old.
3) Karina is currently twice as old as her brother.
4) So, if Karina is 40 years old, her brother must be 20 years old.
5) To find the year her brother was born, we take Karina's birth year (1970) and subtract her brother's age (20 years).
6) 1970 - 20 = 1950.

Answer: 1950.
