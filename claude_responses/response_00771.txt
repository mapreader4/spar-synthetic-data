Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jimmy makes 8 sandwiches in total
* Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread
* So the total number of slices of bread needed is 8 sandwiches x 2 slices per sandwich = 16 slices of bread
* Each pack of bread has 4 slices
* To determine how many packs of bread Jimmy needs to buy, we divide the total number of slices needed (16) by the number of slices per pack (4)
* 16 slices / 4 slices per pack = 4 packs of bread

Answer: 4
