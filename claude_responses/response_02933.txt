Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, there are 235 books in the library.
2) On Tuesday, 227 books are taken out, so the number of books remaining in the library is 235 - 227 = 8.
3) On Thursday, 56 books are brought back, so the number of books in the library is now 8 + 56 = 64.
4) On Friday, 35 books are taken out, so the number of books remaining in the library is 64 - 35 = 29.

Answer: 29
