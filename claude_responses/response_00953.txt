Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wendi initially brought home 4 chickens
* After a few days, she brought home enough additional chickens to double the number of chickens she owned
* So, if she initially had 4 chickens, and she doubled the number, that means she now has 4 + 4 = 8 chickens
* Then, a neighbor's dog ate one of her chickens
* So, she now has 8 - 1 = 7 chickens
* Finally, Wendi found an additional 4 less than ten chickens and brought them home
* So, she added 4 more chickens, bringing her total to 7 + 4 = 11 chickens
