Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 batches of 80 engines each
* So the total number of engines is 5 x 80 = 400 engines
* One fourth of the engines are defective
* To calculate the number of defective engines, we take one fourth of the total number of engines:
* 1/4 of 400 = 400 / 4 = 100 defective engines
* To find the number of engines that are not defective, we subtract the number of defective engines from the total number of engines:
* 400 - 100 = 300 engines that are not defective

Answer: 300
