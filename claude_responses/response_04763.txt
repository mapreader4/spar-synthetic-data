Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dave bought 8 books about animals
* He bought 6 books about outer space
* He bought 3 books about trains
* Each book cost $6

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Multiply the number of books in each category by the cost per book
2. Add up the costs for each category

For the animal books:
* 8 books x $6 per book = $48

For the outer space books:
* 6 books x $6 per book = $36

For the train books:
* 3 books x $6 per book = $18

Now we add up the costs for each category:
* $48 + $36 + $18 = $102

Answer: 102
