Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason has earned the same amount he invested twice over in 5 months
* This means he has earned 3 times his initial investment in 5 months
* If his current investment is worth $90, then his initial investment must have been $30 (since $30 x 3 = $90)
* He has earned $60 in total over the 5 months ($90 - $30 = $60)
* To find his monthly earnings, we divide the total earnings by the number of months:
* $60 / 5 months = $12 per month

Answer: $12
