Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Aleesia lost 1.5 pounds per week for 10 weeks.
* Total weight lost by Aleesia = 1.5 pounds per week x 10 weeks = 15 pounds

Alexei lost 2.5 pounds per week for 8 weeks.
* Total weight lost by Alexei = 2.5 pounds per week x 8 weeks = 20 pounds

Now, to find the total weight lost by the two friends, we add their individual weight losses:
* Total weight lost = Aleesia's weight loss + Alexei's weight loss
* Total weight lost = 15 pounds + 20 pounds = 35 pounds

Answer: 35 pounds
