Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 10 more newborn elephants than baby hippos.
2) The entire herd starts with 20 elephants and 35 hippos.
3) The female hippos, whose number is 5/7 of the total number of hippos, give birth to 5 new baby hippos each.

First, let's find the number of female hippos:
* 5/7 of the total number of hippos = 5/7 * 35 = 25 female hippos

Now, each female hippo gives birth to 5 new baby hippos, so the total number of new baby hippos is:
* 25 female hippos * 5 new baby hippos each = 125 new baby hippos

Since there are 10 more newborn elephants than baby hippos, the number of newborn elephants is:
* 125 new baby hippos + 10 = 135 newborn elephants

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the herd:
* 20 elephants + 135 newborn elephants + 35 hippos + 125 new baby hippos = 315 animals

Answer: 315
