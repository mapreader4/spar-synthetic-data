Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In January, Sara sent 6 letters
* In February, Sara sent 9 letters
* In March, Sara sent triple the number of letters she sent in January
* To calculate the number of letters sent in March, we take the number of letters sent in January (6) and multiply it by 3, which gives us 18 letters

Now, to find the total number of letters Sara sent, we add up the letters sent in each month:
* January: 6 letters
* February: 9 letters
* March: 18 letters

Adding these up, we get:
6 + 9 + 18 = 33 letters

Answer: 33
