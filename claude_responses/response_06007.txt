To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the seeds that Harry wants to buy.

Given information:
- Pumpkin seeds cost $2.50 per packet.
- Tomato seeds cost $1.50 per packet.
- Chili pepper seeds cost $0.90 per packet.
- Harry wants to buy 3 packets of pumpkin seeds, 4 packets of tomato seeds, and 5 packets of chili pepper seeds.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the pumpkin seeds.
Cost of pumpkin seeds = 3 packets × $2.50 per packet = $7.50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the tomato seeds.
Cost of tomato seeds = 4 packets × $1.50 per packet = $6.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the chili pepper seeds.
Cost of chili pepper seeds = 5 packets × $0.90 per packet = $4.50

Step 4: Calculate the total cost by adding the costs of the three types of seeds.
Total cost = Cost of pumpkin seeds + Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of chili pepper seeds
Total cost = $7.50 + $6.00 + $4.50 = $18.00

Answer: $18.
