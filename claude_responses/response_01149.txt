Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mandy started reading books with 8 pages when she was 6 years old.
* When she was twice that age (12 years old), she was reading books 5 times longer, which means the books had 8 x 5 = 40 pages.
* 8 years later, when she was 20 years old, she was reading books 3 times longer than the books she was reading at 12 years old. That means the books had 40 x 3 = 120 pages.
* Presently, she reads books that are 4 times the previous length, which means the books she reads now have 120 x 4 = 480 pages.

Answer: 480
