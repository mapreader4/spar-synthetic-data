Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

When the factory was making cars:
* Cost of materials per month: $100
* Number of cars made per month: 4
* Selling price per car: $50
* Revenue per month from selling cars: 4 cars x $50 per car = $200
* Profit per month from selling cars: $200 revenue - $100 materials = $100 profit

Now that the factory is making motorcycles:
* Cost of materials per month: $250
* Number of motorcycles made per month: 8
* Selling price per motorcycle: $50
* Revenue per month from selling motorcycles: 8 motorcycles x $50 per motorcycle = $400
* Profit per month from selling motorcycles: $400 revenue - $250 materials = $150 profit

To calculate the difference in profit:
* Profit from motorcycles: $150
* Profit from cars: $100
* Difference in profit: $150 - $100 = $50

Answer: $50
