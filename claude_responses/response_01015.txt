Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Oranges have 80 calories each
2) Timmy needs 400 calories
3) To find how many oranges Timmy needs, we divide the total calories needed (400) by the calories per orange (80):
400 calories / 80 calories per orange = 5 oranges
4) Each orange costs $1.20, so the total cost of 5 oranges is:
5 oranges x $1.20 per orange = $6.00
5) Timmy has $10 to start with
6) To find how much money Timmy will have left, we subtract the cost of the oranges ($6.00) from the amount of money he had ($10):
$10 - $6.00 = $4.00

Answer: $4.00
