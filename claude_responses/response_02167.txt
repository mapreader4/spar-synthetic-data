Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The truck driver spends $2 per gallon of gas.
2) The truck driver can drive 10 miles per gallon.
3) The truck driver drives at a rate of 30 miles per hour.
4) The truck driver is paid $0.50 per mile.
5) The truck driver drives for 10 hours.

To calculate the total distance driven in 10 hours:
* Distance driven = Rate of driving x Time driven
* Distance driven = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours = 300 miles

To calculate the total cost of gas for 300 miles:
* Gas used = Distance driven / Miles per gallon
* Gas used = 300 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 30 gallons
* Cost of gas = 30 gallons x $2/gallon = $60

To calculate the total amount the truck driver makes:
* Amount earned = Distance driven x Pay per mile
* Amount earned = 300 miles x $0.50/mile = $150

Subtracting the cost of gas from the amount earned gives us the net amount the truck driver makes:
* Net amount = Amount earned - Cost of gas
* Net amount = $150 - $60 = $90

Answer: $90
