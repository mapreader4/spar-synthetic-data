Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Dave can only ride the merry-go-round for 10 minutes before getting sick.
2) Chuck can ride the merry-go-round 5 times longer than Dave, which means Chuck can ride it for 5 x 10 = 50 minutes.
3) Erica can stay on the merry-go-round 30% longer than Chuck before getting sick.
4) To calculate 30% of 50 minutes, we take 0.3 x 50 = 15 minutes.
5) Therefore, Erica can stay on the merry-go-round for 50 minutes + 15 minutes = 65 minutes.

Answer: 65
