Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Oliver has:
   - 10 $20 bills, which is 10 x $20 = $200
   - 3 $5 bills, which is 3 x $5 = $15
   - Total money for Oliver = $200 + $15 = $215

2. William has:
   - 15 $10 bills, which is 15 x $10 = $150
   - 4 $5 bills, which is 4 x $5 = $20
   - Total money for William = $150 + $20 = $170

3. To find the difference:
   - Oliver's money - William's money = $215 - $170 = $45

Answer: $45
