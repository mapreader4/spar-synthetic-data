Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carlos has some gold quarters.
2) If he spends them in a store, they are worth the regular amount (the face value of a quarter, which is $0.25).
3) If he melts them down, he can get $100 per ounce.
4) Each quarter weighs 1/5 of an ounce.
5) To calculate how much money he would get from melting them down, we need to find the total weight of the quarters and multiply it by the price per ounce.
6) If each quarter weighs 1/5 of an ounce, and he has multiple quarters, the total weight would be the number of quarters multiplied by 1/5 ounce per quarter.
7) Let's say he has X quarters. The total weight would be X * 1/5 ounces.
8) Multiplying the total weight by the price per ounce ($100) gives us the total amount of money he would get from melting them down: X * 1/5 * $100.
9) If he spends them in a store, he would get the face value of each quarter, which is $0.25. The total amount he would get is X * $0.25.
10) To find how many times more money he would get from melting them down, we divide the amount from melting them down by the amount from spending them in a store:
(X * 1/5 * $100) / (X * $0.25) = 100/0.25 = 400.

Answer: 400
