Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Eunice spent $7500 on a used car.
2) The used car price is 25% less than the original price.
3) Let's call the original price "x".
4) Since the used car price is 25% less than the original price, we can say that the used car price is 75% of the original price.
5) The used car price of $7500 is 75% of the original price, x.
6) So we can set up the equation: $7500 = 0.75x
7) Solving for x, we get: x = $7500 / 0.75 = $10,000.

Answer: $10,000
