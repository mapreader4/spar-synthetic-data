Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wade bought 3 sandwiches
* He also bought 2 drinks
* The total cost was $26
* The drinks cost $4 each

First, let's calculate the total cost of the drinks:
* 2 drinks x $4 each = $8

Now, we can subtract the cost of the drinks from the total cost to get the cost of the sandwiches:
* $26 - $8 = $18

Since Wade bought 3 sandwiches, we can divide the total cost of the sandwiches by 3 to get the cost of each sandwich:
* $18 / 3 = $6

Therefore, the cost of each sandwich is $6.

Answer: $6
