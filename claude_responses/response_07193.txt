Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* The test has a total of 40 questions
* One student got a 95% on the exam
* 95% of 40 is 38 questions correct
* Another student got 3 questions wrong out of 40
* That means the other student got 37 questions correct (40 - 3 = 37)
* To get the highest score in the class, Hannah needs to get more than 38 questions correct
* Therefore, Hannah needs to get at least 39 questions correct to have the highest score in the class.

Answer: 39
