Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ava planted 9 apple trees in her backyard
* Lily planted 3 fewer apple trees than Ava
* To find the number of apple trees Lily planted, we subtract 3 from the number Ava planted:
   - Lily planted 9 - 3 = 6 apple trees
* To find the total number of apple trees planted in their backyards collectively, we add the number Ava planted and the number Lily planted:
   - Total apple trees planted = 9 + 6 = 15

Answer: 15
