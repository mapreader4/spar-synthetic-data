Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 18 streets in the neighborhood.
2) The association wants to plant a tree on every street.
3) They want every other tree to be a fruit tree, so they will plant 9 fruit trees.
4) They agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees.
5) Since they are planting 9 fruit trees, and they want equal numbers of each type, they will plant 3 of each type of fruit tree.

Answer: 3 plum trees, 3 pear trees, and 3 apricot trees.
