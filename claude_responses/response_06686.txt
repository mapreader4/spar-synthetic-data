Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ashley wants to serve 2 glasses of champagne to each of her 120 wedding guests.
2) This means she needs to serve a total of 120 * 2 = 240 glasses of champagne.
3) Each bottle of champagne has 6 servings.
4) To calculate the number of bottles needed, we divide the total number of servings needed (240) by the number of servings per bottle (6).
5) 240 / 6 = 40 bottles of champagne.

Answer: 40
