Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The public official wants to donate 5 new soccer balls per class
* There are two schools
* Each school has 4 elementary school classes and 5 middle school classes
* For the first school:
  - 4 elementary school classes x 5 soccer balls per class = 20 soccer balls
  - 5 middle school classes x 5 soccer balls per class = 25 soccer balls
  - Total for the first school = 20 + 25 = 45 soccer balls
* For the second school:
  - 4 elementary school classes x 5 soccer balls per class = 20 soccer balls
  - 5 middle school classes x 5 soccer balls per class = 25 soccer balls
  - Total for the second school = 20 + 25 = 45 soccer balls
* The total number of soccer balls donated by the public official is:
  - 45 + 45 = 90 soccer balls

Answer: 90
