Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The shopkeeper bought 150 packets of milk.
2) Each packet contained 250 ml of milk.
3) To find the total amount of milk in ml, we multiply the number of packets (150) by the amount in each packet (250 ml):
   150 packets x 250 ml/packet = 37,500 ml
4) We know that 1 fluid ounce is equal to 30 ml.
5) To find the total amount of milk in ounces, we divide the total amount in ml (37,500) by the conversion factor of 30 ml/ounce:
   37,500 ml / 30 ml/ounce = 1,250 ounces

Answer: 1,250
