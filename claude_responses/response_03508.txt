Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hour to drive to work in the morning.
2) We also know that he drives at an average speed of 30 mph in the morning.
3) Therefore, the distance he drives to work is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles
4) We know that the return journey takes 1.5 hours.
5) Since the morning and evening traffic is similar, we can assume that the distance he drives back home is also 30 miles.
6) To find the average speed of the return journey, we can use the formula:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 30 miles / 1.5 hours
Speed = 20 mph

Answer: 20 mph
