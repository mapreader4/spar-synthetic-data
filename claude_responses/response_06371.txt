Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Marie's daily revenue:
   - Bread sales: 40 loaves x $2 = $80
   - Cake sales: 6 cakes x $12 = $72
   - Total daily revenue: $80 + $72 = $152

2. Marie's daily expenses:
   - Rent: $20
   - Electricity: $2
   - Total daily expenses: $20 + $2 = $22

3. Marie's daily profit:
   - Daily revenue - Daily expenses = $152 - $22 = $130

4. To calculate the number of days it will take to pay for the cash register:
   - Cost of cash register: $1040
   - Daily profit: $130
   - Number of days = $1040 / $130 = 8 days

Answer: 8 days
