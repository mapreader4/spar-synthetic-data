Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jina has 5 teddies.
2) She has 3 times more bunnies than teddies. So, she has 3 x 5 = 15 bunnies.
3) She also has 1 koala bear.
4) Her mom decided to give her two additional teddies for every bunny she has. So, she gets 2 x 15 = 30 additional teddies.
5) In total, Jina has:
   - 5 teddies (original)
   - 30 additional teddies (from her mom)
   - 15 bunnies
   - 1 koala bear
6) Adding these up, the total number of mascots Jina has is:
   5 + 30 + 15 + 1 = 51

Answer: 51
