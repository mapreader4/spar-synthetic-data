Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that there are three times as many hogs as cats in King Henry's kingdom.
2) We are told that there are 75 hogs.
3) To find the number of cats, we can divide the number of hogs by 3:
   * Number of cats = 75 / 3 = 25
4) Now we need to find 60% of the number of cats:
   * 60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15
5) Finally, we need to find 5 less than 15:
   * 15 - 5 = 10

Answer: 10
