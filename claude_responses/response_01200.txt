Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Kitty spends 5 minutes per week picking up toys and straightening the living room
* Kitty spends 20 minutes per week vacuuming the living room floor, seating, and drapes
* Kitty spends 15 minutes per week cleaning the windows
* Kitty spends 10 minutes per week dusting the furniture

Now, we need to add up the total time spent cleaning the living room per week:
* 5 minutes + 20 minutes + 15 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes per week

After 4 weeks, the total time spent cleaning the living room would be:
* 50 minutes per week x 4 weeks = 200 minutes

Answer: 200 minutes
