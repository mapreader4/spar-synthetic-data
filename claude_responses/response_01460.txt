Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The total distance of the journey is 24 km.
2) The total time for the journey is 8 hours.
3) For the first 4 hours, the man travels at a speed of 4 km/hr.
4) In the first 4 hours, the man travels a distance of 4 km/hr * 4 hours = 16 km.
5) This means the remaining distance to be covered is 24 km - 16 km = 8 km.
6) The remaining time for the journey is 8 hours - 4 hours = 4 hours.
7) To cover the remaining 8 km in 4 hours, the man needs to travel at a speed of 8 km / 4 hours = 2 km/hr.

Answer: 2 km/hr
