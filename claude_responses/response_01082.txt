Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alfred is storing 1 tonne of maize each month for the next 2 years
* 2 years = 24 months
* So, the total amount of maize stored over 2 years is 1 tonne x 24 months = 24 tonnes
* However, 5 tonnes were stolen, so the amount of maize he has is reduced by 5 tonnes
* 24 tonnes - 5 tonnes = 19 tonnes
* Additionally, he was given 8 tonnes as a donation
* 19 tonnes + 8 tonnes = 27 tonnes

Answer: 27 tonnes
