Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Violet needs 800 ml of water per hour
* Her dog needs 400 ml of water per hour
* Together, they need 800 ml + 400 ml = 1200 ml of water per hour
* Violet can carry 4.8 L of water
* 1 L = 1000 ml
* So Violet can carry 4.8 L = 4800 ml of water

Now, we need to calculate how many hours they can hike with 4800 ml of water.
* They need 1200 ml per hour
* 4800 ml / 1200 ml per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, Violet and her dog can hike for 4 hours.
