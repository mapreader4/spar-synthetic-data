Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* American carmakers produce 5,650,000 cars each year
* They distribute these cars to 5 car suppliers
* The first supplier receives 1,000,000 cars
* The second supplier receives 500,000 more cars than the first supplier, so 1,500,000 cars
* The third supplier receives the same number of cars as the first and second suppliers combined, which is 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,500,000 cars
* The fourth and fifth suppliers each receive an equal number of cars
* To find the number of cars the fourth and fifth suppliers each receive, we need to subtract the number of cars given to the first three suppliers from the total number of cars produced:
* Total cars produced: 5,650,000
* Cars given to first supplier: 1,000,000
* Cars given to second supplier: 1,500,000
* Cars given to third supplier: 2,500,000
* Total cars given to first three suppliers: 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 2,500,000 = 5,000,000
* Remaining cars: 5,650,000 - 5,000,000 = 650,000
* Since the fourth and fifth suppliers each receive an equal number of cars, we divide the remaining 650,000 cars by 2 to get the number of cars each supplier receives:

Answer: 325,000
