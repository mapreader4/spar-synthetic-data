Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Barney's grocery store ordered 4458 items to restock the shelves
* They sold 1561 items that day
* They have 575 items left in the storeroom

To find the total number of items left in the whole store, we need to:
1. Subtract the number of items sold (1561) from the total number of items ordered (4458)
2. Add the number of items left in the storeroom (575)

Step 1: 4458 - 1561 = 2897
Step 2: 2897 + 575 = 3472

Answer: 3472
