Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We are told that there are 9,000 chickens on the chicken farm.
2) We are also told that the roosters outnumber the hens 2 to 1.
3) This means that for every 3 chickens, 2 are roosters and 1 is a hen.
4) To find the number of roosters, we can set up a proportion:
   Total Chickens / 3 = Roosters / 2
5) Plugging in the values, we get:
   9,000 / 3 = Roosters / 2
6) Solving for Roosters, we get:
   Roosters = (9,000 / 3) * 2 = 6,000

Answer: 6,000
