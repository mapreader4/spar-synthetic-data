Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mr. Grey purchased:
   - 3 polo shirts at $26 each
   - 2 necklaces at $83 each
   - 1 computer game at $90

2. To calculate the total cost before the rebate:
   - 3 polo shirts at $26 each = 3 x $26 = $78
   - 2 necklaces at $83 each = 2 x $83 = $166
   - 1 computer game at $90 = $90
   - Total cost before rebate = $78 + $166 + $90 = $334

3. Mr. Grey received a $12 rebate.
   - Total cost after rebate = $334 - $12 = $322

Answer: $322
