Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mom started with €55
* She bought:
    - 2 packs of bananas at €4 each, so 2 x €4 = €8
    - Pears for €2
    - Asparagus for €6
    - A chicken for €11
* Adding up all her purchases:
    - €8 + €2 + €6 + €11 = €27
* To calculate how much money Mom has left, we take the starting amount (€55) and subtract the total purchases (€27):
    - €55 - €27 = €28

Answer: €28
