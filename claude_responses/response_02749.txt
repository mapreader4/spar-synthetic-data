Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alex made 8 baskets.
2) Sandra made three times as many baskets as Alex, so Sandra made 3 x 8 = 24 baskets.
3) Hector made two times the number of baskets that Sandra made, so Hector made 2 x 24 = 48 baskets.
4) To find the total number of baskets made, we add up the baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector:
8 + 24 + 48 = 80 baskets.

Answer: 80
