Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sam and Drew have a combined age of 54.
2) Sam is half of Drew's age. This means that if Drew's age is x, then Sam's age is x/2.
3) We can set up an equation to represent this:
   x + x/2 = 54
4) Solving for x, we get:
   3x/2 = 54
   x = 36
5) Since Sam is half of Drew's age, and Drew's age is 36, then Sam's age is 36/2 = 18.

Answer: 18
