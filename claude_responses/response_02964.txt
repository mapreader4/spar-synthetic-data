Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Darcie is 4 years old.
2) Darcie is 1/6 as old as her mother.
   - This means her mother's age is 6 times Darcie's age.
   - Her mother's age = 6 x 4 = 24 years old.
3) Her mother is 4/5 as old as her father.
   - This means her father's age is 5/4 times her mother's age.
   - Her father's age = 5/4 x 24 = 30 years old.

Answer: 30
