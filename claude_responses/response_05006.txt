Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 3 packs of candy
* He pays with a $20 bill
* He gets $11 in change

To find the cost of each pack of candy, we need to first find the total cost of the 3 packs of candy.

We know that James paid $20 and received $11 in change, so the total cost of the 3 packs of candy must have been:
* $20 - $11 = $9

Since James bought 3 packs of candy, we can divide the total cost by 3 to find the cost of each pack:
* $9 / 3 = $3

Therefore, the cost of each pack of candy is $3.

Answer: 3
