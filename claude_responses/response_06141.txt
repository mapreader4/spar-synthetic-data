Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of filling the car fuel tank is $45.
2) This can take the car 500 miles before refilling.
3) Mallory's destination is 2000 miles away.
4) To calculate the number of times Mallory needs to refill the car, we divide the total distance (2000 miles) by the distance per refill (500 miles), which is 2000 / 500 = 4 times.
5) The total cost of filling the car fuel tank for the whole journey is 4 x $45 = $180.
6) Mallory used 3/5 times as much money on food as she spent on filling the car fuel tank for the whole journey.
7) The amount spent on food is 3/5 x $180 = $108.
8) The total amount of money Mallory used is the sum of the cost of filling the car fuel tank ($180) and the cost of food ($108), which is $180 + $108 = $288.
