Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of the crown is $20,000.
2) The king tips the person 10% of the cost of the crown.
3) To calculate the tip, we take 10% of the cost of the crown:
   10% of $20,000 = 0.10 x $20,000 = $2,000
4) To calculate the total amount the king paid, we add the cost of the crown ($20,000) and the tip ($2,000):
   $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000

Answer: $22,000
