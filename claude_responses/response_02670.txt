Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) On the first day, the number of people counted was twice the total number counted on the second day.
2) On the second day, 500 people were counted.
3) So, the number of people counted on the first day was 2 x 500 = 1000 people.
4) The total number of people counted on the two days is the sum of the people counted on the first day and the second day.
5) The total number of people counted on the two days is 1000 + 500 = 1500 people.

Answer: 1500
