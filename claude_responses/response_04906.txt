Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Monroe has 8 spiders
* Each spider has 8 legs
* So the total number of legs from the spiders is 8 spiders x 8 legs per spider = 64 legs
* Monroe also has 12 ants
* Each ant has 6 legs
* So the total number of legs from the ants is 12 ants x 6 legs per ant = 72 legs
* To find the total number of legs in the entire collection, we add the legs from the spiders and the legs from the ants:
* 64 legs (spiders) + 72 legs (ants) = 136 legs

Answer: 136
