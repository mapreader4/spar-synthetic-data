Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The field is 20 feet wide and 60 feet long.
2) To wrap the tape around the field once, we need to calculate the perimeter of the field.
3) The perimeter of the field is 2 times the width (20 feet) plus 2 times the length (60 feet).
4) 2 x 20 feet + 2 x 60 feet = 160 feet.
5) Joy has 250 feet of tape.
6) The amount of tape left over is 250 feet - 160 feet = 90 feet.

Answer: 90
