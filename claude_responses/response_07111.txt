Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerry finds 6 hawk feathers.
2) He finds 17 times as many eagle feathers as hawk feathers. So, the number of eagle feathers is 17 x 6 = 102.
3) The total number of feathers Jerry has is 6 + 102 = 108.
4) Jerry gives 10 feathers to his sister, so he has 108 - 10 = 98 feathers left.
5) Jerry sells half of the remaining feathers, so he sells 98 / 2 = 49 feathers.
6) The number of feathers Jerry has left is 98 - 49 = 49.

Answer: 49
