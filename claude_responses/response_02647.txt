Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 200 snakes in the park in total.
2) There are three times as many pythons as boa constrictors.
3) There are 40 boa constrictors.
4) Since there are three times as many pythons as boa constrictors, and there are 40 boa constrictors, the number of pythons is 3 * 40 = 120.
5) The remaining snakes must be rattlesnakes. To find the number of rattlesnakes, we subtract the number of boa constrictors and the number of pythons from the total number of snakes:
200 - 40 - 120 = 40.
Answer: 40
