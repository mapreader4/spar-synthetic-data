Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that 8 carpenters can make 50 chairs in 10 days.
2) This means that the rate of chair production is 50 chairs / 10 days = 5 chairs per day.
3) We also know that we need to make 75 chairs in 10 days.
4) To find the number of carpenters needed, we need to find the rate of chair production needed to make 75 chairs in 10 days.
5) The rate of chair production needed is 75 chairs / 10 days = 7.5 chairs per day.
6) Since each carpenter produces 5 chairs per day, we need to find how many carpenters are needed to produce 7.5 chairs per day.
7) 7.5 chairs per day / 5 chairs per carpenter per day = 1.5 carpenters.
8) Since we can't have a fractional number of carpenters, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
9) Therefore, the number of carpenters needed to make 75 chairs in 10 days is 2.
