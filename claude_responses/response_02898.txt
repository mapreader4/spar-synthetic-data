Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The elevator needs to move down 20 floors to reach the bottom
* It takes 15 minutes for the elevator to travel down the first half of the floors, which is 10 floors
* It then takes 5 minutes per floor to travel down the next 5 floors
* It then takes 16 minutes per floor for the elevator to finish traveling down the final 5 floors

First, let's calculate the time it took to travel the first 10 floors:
* 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it took to travel the next 5 floors:
* 5 minutes per floor x 5 floors = 25 minutes

Finally, let's calculate the time it took to travel the last 5 floors:
* 16 minutes per floor x 5 floors = 80 minutes

Now, let's add up the total time:
* 15 minutes + 25 minutes + 80 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
* 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
