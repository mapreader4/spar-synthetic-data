Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Grayson has 100 questions on the test
* He answers some of the questions for 2 hours
* He takes 2 minutes for each answer

To find out how many questions he answered, we need to calculate how many questions he could answer in 2 hours:
* 2 hours = 120 minutes
* 120 minutes / 2 minutes per question = 60 questions

So, Grayson answered 60 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions he left unanswered, we subtract the number of questions he answered from the total number of questions:
* 100 questions - 60 questions = 40 questions

Answer: 40
