Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Abraham's budget for the shopping trip is $60.
2) He buys 4 shower gels at $4 each, which is 4 x $4 = $16.
3) He also buys a tube of toothpaste for $3.
4) He has $30 remaining in his budget, which means he has spent $60 - $30 = $30 so far.
5) The total amount he has spent so far is $16 (shower gels) + $3 (toothpaste) = $19.
6) Therefore, the amount he spent on the box of laundry detergent must be $30 - $19 = $11.

Answer: $11
