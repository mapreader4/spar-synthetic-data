Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Kallie received 4000 views on the first day
* 4 days later, the number of views had increased by a number ten times more than the views on the first day
* 50000 more people viewed the video after another two days

First, let's calculate the number of views after the first 4 days:
* The number of views increased by a number ten times more than the first day
* So, the increase in views = 4000 x 10 = 40,000
* Total views after 4 days = 4000 + 40,000 = 44,000

Now, after another two days, 50,000 more people viewed the video.
* Total views = 44,000 + 50,000 = 94,000

Answer: 94,000
