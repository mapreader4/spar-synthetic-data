Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Keith bought 8 new baseball trading cards
* The next day, his dog ate half of his collection
* There are now only 46 cards left

To find the total number of cards Keith started with, we need to work backwards.

First, we know that after the dog ate half of the collection, there were 46 cards left.
* This means that before the dog ate half, there were 2 x 46 = 92 cards.

Now, we know that Keith bought 8 new cards the day before.
* This means that before the 8 new cards were added, there were 92 - 8 = 84 cards.

Therefore, the total number of cards Keith started with was 84.

Answer: 84
