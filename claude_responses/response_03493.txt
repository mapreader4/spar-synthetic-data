Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Princess Puff has 14 whiskers.
2) Catman Do has 6 less than twice the number of whiskers as Princess Puff.
3) To find the number of whiskers Catman Do has, we first need to find twice the number of whiskers as Princess Puff.
4) Twice the number of whiskers as Princess Puff is 2 x 14 = 28.
5) Catman Do has 6 less than 28 whiskers, so Catman Do has 28 - 6 = 22 whiskers.

Answer: 22
