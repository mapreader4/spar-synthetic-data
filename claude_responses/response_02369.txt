Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jason is charging $50.00 per day for the carriage house rental.
2) If you rent the house for 14 days, the total cost is $500.00.
3) Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.
4) To calculate the cost for 20 days, we can use the daily rate of $50.00:
20 days x $50.00 per day = $1,000.00

Answer: $1,000
