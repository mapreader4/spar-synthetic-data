Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each window has 4 glass panels
* The house has 6 double windows downstairs
* Each double window has 2 sets of 4 glass panels, so 8 glass panels per double window
* There are 6 double windows downstairs, so the total number of glass panels downstairs is:
6 double windows x 8 glass panels per double window = 48 glass panels downstairs
* The house also has 8 single windows upstairs
* Each single window has 4 glass panels
* So the total number of glass panels upstairs is:
8 single windows x 4 glass panels per single window = 32 glass panels upstairs
* To get the total number of glass panels in the whole house, we add the glass panels downstairs and upstairs:
48 glass panels downstairs + 32 glass panels upstairs = 80 glass panels

Answer: 80
