Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of guests at the party: 200
* 40% of the guests are women
* 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears
* 60% of the males are wearing rabbit ears

First, let's calculate the number of women at the party:
* 40% of 200 guests = 0.40 * 200 = 80 women

Next, let's calculate the number of women wearing rabbit ears:
* 80% of 80 women = 0.80 * 80 = 64 women wearing rabbit ears

Now, let's calculate the number of men at the party:
* Total guests - women = 200 - 80 = 120 men

Finally, let's calculate the number of men wearing rabbit ears:
* 60% of 120 men = 0.60 * 120 = 72 men wearing rabbit ears

To get the total number of people wearing rabbit ears, we add the number of women and men wearing rabbit ears:
* 64 women + 72 men = 136 people wearing rabbit ears

Answer: 136
