Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The family of 4 arrived and received 4 oranges from the promotion
* They had planned to spend $15 on oranges at the stop
* The oranges would have cost $1.5 each at the stop
* To calculate the amount they saved:
  * The oranges would have cost $1.5 each
  * They received 4 oranges, so the total cost would have been 4 * $1.5 = $6
  * They saved $15 - $6 = $9
* To calculate the percentage of the money they planned to spend that they saved:
  * They planned to spend $15
  * They saved $9
  * The percentage saved is (9 / 15) * 100 = 60%

Answer: 60
