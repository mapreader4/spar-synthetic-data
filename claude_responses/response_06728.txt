Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Michael has $42 and his brother has $17.
2. Michael gives away half of his money to his brother. That means Michael gives his brother $21.
3. Now, the brother has $17 + $21 = $38.
4. The brother then buys $3 worth of candy.
5. So, the amount of money the brother has in the end is $38 - $3 = $35.
