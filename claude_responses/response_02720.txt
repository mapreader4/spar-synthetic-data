Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kaylee needs to sell a total of 33 boxes of biscuits
* So far, she has sold:
    - 12 boxes of lemon biscuits to her aunt
    - 5 boxes of chocolate biscuits to her mother
    - 4 boxes of oatmeal biscuits to a neighbor
* To calculate the total number of boxes she has sold so far, we add these up:
    - 12 + 5 + 4 = 21 boxes sold
* Now, to find out how many more boxes she needs to sell, we subtract the number of boxes she has already sold from the total she needs to sell:
    - 33 - 21 = 12 boxes

Answer: 12
