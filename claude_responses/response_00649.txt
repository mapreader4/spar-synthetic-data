Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The price of one pencil is 20 cents
* Tolu wants 3 pencils
* Robert wants 5 pencils
* Melissa wants 2 pencils

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost for each student and then add them together.

Tolu's cost:
* 3 pencils x 20 cents per pencil = 60 cents

Robert's cost:
* 5 pencils x 20 cents per pencil = 100 cents

Melissa's cost:
* 2 pencils x 20 cents per pencil = 40 cents

Now we add up the total cost for all the students:
* 60 cents + 100 cents + 40 cents = 200 cents

To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100:
* 200 cents / 100 = 2 dollars
