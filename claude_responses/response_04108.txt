Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Justin gets home at 5 pm
* Dinner takes 45 minutes, so that's until 5:45 pm
* Homework takes 30 minutes, so that's until 6:15 pm
* Cleaning his room takes 30 minutes, so that's until 6:45 pm
* Taking out the trash takes 5 minutes, so that's until 6:50 pm
* Emptying the dishwasher takes 10 minutes, so that's until 7:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Justin could start his chores and homework to be done by 8 pm is 5:00 pm.
