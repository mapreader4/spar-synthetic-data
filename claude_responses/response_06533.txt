Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yesterday, Tony drank 48 ounces of water
* This is 4% less than what he drank two days ago
* To find the amount of water he drank two days ago, we need to find the original amount that is 4% more than 48 ounces

First, let's calculate the 4% difference:
* 4% of 48 ounces = 0.04 * 48 = 1.92 ounces

Now, we can add this 1.92 ounces to the 48 ounces he drank yesterday to get the original amount:
* 48 ounces + 1.92 ounces = 49.92 ounces

Therefore, the amount of water Tony drank two days ago was 49.92 ounces.

Answer: 50 ounces
