Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 60 individuals total
* 24 out of 60 individuals like football
* 50% of those who like football play it
To find the number of people who play football:
1) Calculate the percentage of people who like football: 24/60 = 40%
2) Calculate the number of people who play football: 40% of 24 = 50% of 24 = 12 people
Now, to find the number of people who play football out of a group of 250:
* Since 12 out of 60 people play football, we can use a proportion to find the number out of 250:
* 12/60 = x/250
* Solving for x, we get x = 50
Answer: 50
