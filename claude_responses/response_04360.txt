Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter
* The price of the butter was 80% of the price of cheese
* The tea cost $10 and was the most expensive item, costing twice the price of a package of cheese

First, let's find the price of the cheese:
* The tea cost $10 and was twice the price of the cheese
* So the price of the cheese is $10 / 2 = $5

Now, let's find the price of the butter:
* The price of the butter was 80% of the price of the cheese
* So the price of the butter is $5 * 0.8 = $4

Finally, let's find the price of the bread:
* The bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter
* So the price of the bread is $4 / 2 = $2

Now we can add up the total cost of Ursula's purchases:
* Butter: $4
* Bread: $2
* Cheese: $5
* Tea: $10
* Total: $4 + $2 + $5 + $10 = $21

Answer: $21
