Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 1 bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds
* Each individual ear of corn weighs 0.5 pounds
* Clyde picked 2 bushels of corn

To find the number of individual corn cobs, we need to:
1. Calculate the total weight of the 2 bushels of corn:
   * 2 bushels x 56 pounds/bushel = 112 pounds

2. Divide the total weight by the weight of each individual ear of corn to get the total number of ears:
   * 112 pounds / 0.5 pounds/ear = 224 ears of corn

Answer: 224
