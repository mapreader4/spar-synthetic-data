Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The problem states that "Fifteen more than a quarter of a number is 27".
2) Let's represent the unknown number as "x".
3) A quarter of the number is x/4.
4) Fifteen more than a quarter of the number is (x/4) + 15.
5) The problem states that (x/4) + 15 = 27.
6) Solving for x, we get:
x/4 + 15 = 27
x/4 = 27 - 15
x/4 = 12
x = 12 * 4
x = 48
Answer: 48
