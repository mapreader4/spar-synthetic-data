Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 40 people in the cafeteria
* 7 out of the 40 people are wearing checkered shirts
* The rest of the people are wearing vertical stripes and horizontal stripes
* The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts

First, let's find the number of people wearing horizontal stripes:
* The number of people wearing checkered shirts is 7
* The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts
* Therefore, the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 x 7 = 28

Now, let's find the number of people wearing vertical stripes:
* The total number of people in the cafeteria is 40
* The number of people wearing checkered shirts is 7
* The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 28
* The number of people wearing vertical stripes is the remaining people
* 40 - 7 - 28 = 5
