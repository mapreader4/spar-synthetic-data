Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Beatrice bought 20 books
* The first 5 books cost $20 each
* So the cost of the first 5 books is 5 * $20 = $100
* For the remaining 15 books, Beatrice receives a $2 discount per book
* The cost of the remaining 15 books is 15 * ($20 - $2) = 15 * $18 = $270
* The total cost is the cost of the first 5 books plus the cost of the remaining 15 books
* Total cost = $100 + $270 = $370

Answer: 370
