Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Originally, Central Park had 8 more than half the number of trash cans in Veteran's Park.
   * Let's call the number of trash cans in Veteran's Park as "x".
   * Then, the number of trash cans in Central Park was (x/2) + 8.

2) Someone took half of the trash cans from Central Park and put them in Veteran's Park.
   * So, the number of trash cans taken from Central Park was ((x/2) + 8) / 2 = (x/4) + 4.
   * This means the new number of trash cans in Veteran's Park is x + (x/4) + 4.

3) We know that originally there were 24 trash cans in Veteran's Park.
   * So, the new number of trash cans in Veteran's Park is x + (x/4) + 4 = 24.

4) Solving for x, we get:
   * x + (x/4) + 4 = 24
   * (5x/4) + 4 = 24
   * 5x/4 = 20
   * x = 16

Therefore, the number of trash cans now in Veteran's Park is 16.

Answer: 16
