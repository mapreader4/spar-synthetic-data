Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Charley bought 30 pencils initially
* She lost 6 pencils while moving to school
* So, she had 30 - 6 = 24 pencils remaining
* She then lost 1/3 of the remaining 24 pencils
* 1/3 of 24 is 24 / 3 = 8 pencils
* So, she lost an additional 8 pencils
* Therefore, the number of pencils she currently has is 24 - 8 = 16 pencils

Answer: 16
