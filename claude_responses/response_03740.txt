Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Grace's age is 3/8th the age of her grandmother.
2) Grace's grandmother is twice the age of Grace's mother.
3) Grace's mother is 80 years old.

First, let's find the age of Grace's grandmother:
* Grace's grandmother is twice the age of Grace's mother.
* Grace's mother is 80 years old.
* Therefore, Grace's grandmother is 2 * 80 = 160 years old.

Now, let's find Grace's age:
* Grace's age is 3/8th the age of her grandmother.
* Grace's grandmother is 160 years old.
* Therefore, Grace's age is 3/8 * 160 = 60 years old.

Answer: 60
