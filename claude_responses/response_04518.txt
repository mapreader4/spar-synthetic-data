Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carl's car gets 30 miles per gallon in the city and 40 miles per gallon on the highway.
2) The distance from his house to the Grand Canyon is 60 city miles and 200 highway miles.
3) To calculate the city miles, we divide the 60 city miles by 30 miles per gallon, which gives us 2 gallons of gas needed for the city portion.
4) To calculate the highway miles, we divide the 200 highway miles by 40 miles per gallon, which gives us 5 gallons of gas needed for the highway portion.
5) In total, Carl will need 2 + 5 = 7 gallons of gas for the trip.
6) Since gas costs $3.00 per gallon, the total cost will be 7 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $21.00.

Answer: $21
