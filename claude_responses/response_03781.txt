Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Joan has 180 socks in total.
2) Two-thirds of the socks are white. To find the number of white socks, we can multiply the total number of socks (180) by two-thirds (2/3):
180 * (2/3) = 120 white socks
3) The remaining socks must be blue. To find the number of blue socks, we can subtract the number of white socks from the total number of socks:
180 - 120 = 60 blue socks
Answer: 60
