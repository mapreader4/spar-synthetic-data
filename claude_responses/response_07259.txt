Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Sally sold 20 cups of lemonade last week.
2) This week, she sold 30% more lemonade than last week.
3) To calculate the number of cups she sold this week, we take the 20 cups from last week and add 30% of that amount:
   20 cups + (20 * 0.30) = 20 + 6 = 26 cups
4) To find the total number of cups of lemonade she sold in both weeks, we add the 20 cups from last week and the 26 cups from this week:
   20 + 26 = 46 cups

Answer: 46
