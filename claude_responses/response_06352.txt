Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chairs make 6 sticks of wood each
* Tables make 9 sticks of wood each
* Stools make 2 sticks of wood each
* Mary needs to burn 5 sticks of wood per hour to stay warm
* Mary chops up 18 chairs, 6 tables, and 4 stools

First, let's calculate the total number of sticks of wood Mary has:
* 18 chairs x 6 sticks/chair = 108 sticks
* 6 tables x 9 sticks/table = 54 sticks
* 4 stools x 2 sticks/stool = 8 sticks
* Total sticks of wood = 108 + 54 + 8 = 170 sticks

Now, we know that Mary needs to burn 5 sticks of wood per hour to stay warm. 
* So, the number of hours Mary can keep warm = 170 sticks / 5 sticks per hour = 34 hours

Answer: 34
