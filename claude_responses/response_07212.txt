Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The three next highest jumpers can jump 23 inches, 27 inches, and 28 inches.
2) To find the average jump of these three jumpers, we add up the heights and divide by 3:
   (23 + 27 + 28) / 3 = 78 / 3 = 26 inches
3) Ravi can jump 1.5 times higher than the average jump of the three next highest jumpers.
4) So, to find Ravi's jump height, we multiply the average jump of 26 inches by 1.5:
   26 inches * 1.5 = 39 inches

Answer: 39 inches
