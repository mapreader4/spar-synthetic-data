Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Oxford High School has 48 teachers
* Oxford High School has 1 principal
* Oxford High School has 15 classes
* Each class has 20 students

To find the total number of people in Oxford High School, we need to add up the number of teachers, the principal, and the total number of students.

The number of students can be calculated as:
* 15 classes x 20 students per class = 300 students

Now, we can add up the total:
* 48 teachers + 1 principal + 300 students = 349 people

Answer: 349
