Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Stacy, Steve, and Skylar have a total of 1100 berries
* Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve
* Steve has double the number of berries that Skylar has

Let's start by representing the number of berries each person has:
* Let Skylar have x berries
* Then Steve has 2x berries
* And Stacy has 4 * 2x = 8x berries

Now we can set up an equation to solve for the number of berries Stacy has:
* Stacy's berries + Steve's berries + Skylar's berries = 1100
* 8x + 2x + x = 1100
* 11x = 1100
* x = 100

Therefore, Stacy has 8x = 8 * 100 = 800 berries.

Answer: 800
