Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Andrew rides the subway for 10 hours.
2) He then takes the train and rides for twice as much time as the subway ride, which is 2 x 10 = 20 hours.
3) Finally, he bikes the remaining distance for 8 hours.
4) To calculate the total time, we add up the time for each mode of transportation:
   - Subway: 10 hours
   - Train: 20 hours
   - Biking: 8 hours
5) The total time is 10 + 20 + 8 = 38 hours.

Answer: 38
