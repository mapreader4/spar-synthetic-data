Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 400 mangoes on the tree to start with.
2) 3/5 of the mangoes are ripe. To find the number of ripe mangoes, we multiply 400 by 3/5:
400 * 3/5 = 240 ripe mangoes
3) Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes. To find the number of ripe mangoes she eats, we multiply 240 by 0.6 (60% expressed as a decimal):
240 * 0.6 = 144 ripe mangoes eaten by Lindsay
4) To find the number of ripe mangoes remaining, we subtract the number of mangoes eaten by Lindsay from the total number of ripe mangoes:
240 - 144 = 96 ripe mangoes remaining

Answer: 96
