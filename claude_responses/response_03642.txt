Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 7 fewer noodles than pirates
* There are 45 pirates
* To find the number of noodles, we can subtract 7 from the number of pirates:
* Number of noodles = 45 - 7 = 38
* To find the total number of noodles and pirates, we add the number of noodles and the number of pirates:
* Total number of noodles and pirates = 38 + 45 = 83

Answer: 83
