Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The customer bought 20 pens for $30
* The first 10 pens were at the regular price
* The next 10 pens were at half off the regular price
* Let's call the regular price of one pen 'x'
* The first 10 pens cost 10x
* The next 10 pens cost 5x (half off the regular price)
* The total cost is $30
* So, 10x + 5x = 30
* Simplifying, 15x = 30
* Dividing both sides by 15, x = 2
