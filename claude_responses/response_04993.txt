Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The regular price of a medium pizza is $18
* With the promotion, you can get the next 3 medium pizzas for $5 each
* To take full advantage of the promotion, you need to buy a regular large pizza first
* The savings would be the difference between the regular price of 3 medium pizzas and the discounted price of 3 medium pizzas

First, let's calculate the regular price of 3 medium pizzas:
* 3 medium pizzas at $18 each = 3 x $18 = $54

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of 3 medium pizzas:
* 3 medium pizzas at $5 each = 3 x $5 = $15

The total savings would be the difference between the regular price and the discounted price:
* $54 - $15 = $39

Answer: $39
