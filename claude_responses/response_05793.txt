Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Samantha buys 4 dog toys
* Each toy costs $12.00
* The promotion is "buy one get one half off"

To calculate the total cost, we can split the 4 toys into 2 groups:
* Group 1: 2 toys at full price ($12.00 each)
* Group 2: 2 toys at half price ($6.00 each)

The total cost for Group 1 is:
* 2 toys x $12.00 = $24.00

The total cost for Group 2 is:
* 2 toys x $6.00 = $12.00

The total amount Samantha spends is the sum of the two groups:
* $24.00 + $12.00 = $36.00

Answer: $36
