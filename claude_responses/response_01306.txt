Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anna's mom gave her $10.00 to spend at the candy store
* Anna bought:
  - 3 packs of chewing gum at $1.00 each, so that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00
  - 5 chocolate bars at $1.00 each, so that's 5 x $1.00 = $5.00
  - 2 large candy canes at $0.50 each, so that's 2 x $0.50 = $1.00
* So the total amount Anna spent is:
  - $3.00 + $5.00 + $1.00 = $9.00
* Anna's mom gave her $10.00 to spend
* Anna spent $9.00
* Therefore, the amount of money Anna had left is:
  - $10.00 - $9.00 = $1.00
