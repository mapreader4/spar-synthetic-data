Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nori had 4 boxes of crayons, with 8 crayons in each box.
* So the total number of crayons Nori had initially is:
4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons
* Nori gave 5 crayons to Mae.
* Nori has 15 crayons left.
* To find how many crayons Nori gave to Lea, we can subtract the 5 crayons given to Mae and the 15 crayons left from the total 32 crayons:
32 crayons - 5 crayons (given to Mae) - 15 crayons (left) = 12 crayons given to Lea
* To find how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we subtract the 5 crayons given to Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea:
12 crayons (given to Lea) - 5 crayons (given to Mae) = 7 more crayons given to Lea than Mae
