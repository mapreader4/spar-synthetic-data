Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) In the first game, Clayton scored 10 points.
2) In the second game, Clayton scored 14 points.
3) In the third game, Clayton scored 6 points.
4) To find the average of the points scored in the first three games, we add up the points and divide by 3:
   (10 + 14 + 6) / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10 points
5) In the fourth game, Clayton scored the average of 10 points.
6) To find the total points scored in the first four games, we add up the points from all four games:
   10 + 14 + 6 + 10 = 40 points

Answer: 40
