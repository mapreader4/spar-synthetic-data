Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that after five years, Ron will be four times as old as Maurice.
2) Ron's age now is 43.
3) So, after five years, Ron's age will be 43 + 5 = 48.
4) If Ron is four times as old as Maurice after five years, then Maurice's age after five years will be 48 / 4 = 12.
5) Therefore, Maurice's age now is 12 - 5 = 7.
