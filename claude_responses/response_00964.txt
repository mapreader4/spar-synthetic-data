Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kevin's record is 64 wings in 8 minutes
* That means he eats 64 / 8 = 8 wings per minute
* Alan can currently eat 5 wings per minute
* To beat Kevin's record, Alan needs to eat more than 8 wings per minute
* So, the difference between what Alan can currently eat and what he needs to eat to beat the record is:
* 8 wings per minute - 5 wings per minute = 3 wings per minute
