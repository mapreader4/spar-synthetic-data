Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Reptile House has 5 fewer animals than 3 times the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit.
2) The Reptile House has 16 animals.
3) Let's call the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit 'x'.
4) The Reptile House has 3x - 5 animals.
5) Since the Reptile House has 16 animals, we can set up the equation:
3x - 5 = 16
6) Solving for x, we get:
3x = 21
x = 7
Therefore, the Rain Forest exhibit has 7 animals.
