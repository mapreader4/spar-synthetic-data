Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pat earns $15 for every photo he takes of a shark
* He sees a shark about every 10 minutes
* In 5 hours, he will see 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes / 10 minutes per shark = 30 sharks
* So, he will earn 30 sharks * $15 per photo = $450 in total
* His boat fuel costs $50 per hour
* He hunts for 5 hours, so his fuel cost is 5 hours * $50 per hour = $250
* To calculate his profit, we take the total earnings ($450) and subtract the fuel cost ($250)
* $450 - $250 = $200

Answer: $200
