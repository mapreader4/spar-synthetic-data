Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janice bought 5 juices for $10 in total
* This means each juice costs $10 / 5 = $2
* Janice also bought 2 sandwiches for $6 in total
* This means each sandwich costs $6 / 2 = $3
* If Janice were to buy 1 sandwich and 1 juice, the total cost would be:
* 1 sandwich at $3
* 1 juice at $2
* Total cost = $3 + $2 = $5
