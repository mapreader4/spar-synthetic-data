Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, which means the total number of children is 12 (5 + 7).
2) Since the total number of children is 180, we can divide 180 by 12 to get the number of children in each group:
180 / 12 = 15
3) So there are 5 groups of 15 boys and 7 groups of 15 girls, for a total of 75 boys and 105 girls.
4) The boys are given $3900 to share, so we divide $3900 by 75 to get the amount each boy receives:
$3900 / 75 = $52
Answer: $52
