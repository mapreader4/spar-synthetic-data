Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kim sold twice as many boxes on Tuesday as she did on Wednesday
* She sold twice as many boxes on Wednesday as she did on Thursday
* Kim sold 1200 boxes of cupcakes on Thursday

First, let's find out how many boxes she sold on Wednesday:
* If she sold twice as many on Wednesday as she did on Thursday, and she sold 1200 on Thursday, then she sold 2 * 1200 = 2400 boxes on Wednesday.

Now, let's find out how many boxes she sold on Tuesday:
* If she sold twice as many on Tuesday as she did on Wednesday, and she sold 2400 on Wednesday, then she sold 2 * 2400 = 4800 boxes on Tuesday.

Answer: 4800
