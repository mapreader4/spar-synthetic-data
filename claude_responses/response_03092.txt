Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The hardware store sold:
  - 10 graphics cards at $600 each
  - 14 hard drives at $80 each
  - 8 CPUs at $200 each
  - 4 pairs of RAM at $60 per pair
* To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price, and then add up the results.

Graphics cards:
* 10 graphics cards x $600 per card = $6,000

Hard drives:
* 14 hard drives x $80 per drive = $1,120

CPUs:
* 8 CPUs x $200 per CPU = $1,600

RAM:
* 4 pairs of RAM x $60 per pair = $240

Total earnings:
* $6,000 + $1,120 + $1,600 + $240 = $8,960

Answer: $8,960
