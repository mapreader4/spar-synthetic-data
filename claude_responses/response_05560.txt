Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The tallest tree is 108 feet.
2. The middle-sized tree is 6 feet less than half the height of the tallest tree.
   * Half the height of the tallest tree is 108 / 2 = 54 feet.
   * The middle-sized tree is 54 - 6 = 48 feet.
3. The smallest tree is 1/4 the height of the middle tree.
   * The height of the middle tree is 48 feet.
   * 1/4 of 48 feet is 48 / 4 = 12 feet.

Answer: 12 feet
