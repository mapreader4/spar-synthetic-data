Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first box contains cards that cost $1.25 each
* The boy buys 6 cards from the first box
* So, the cost of the cards from the first box is:
  * 6 cards x $1.25 per card = $7.50
* The second box contains cards that cost $1.75 each
* The boy buys 6 cards from the second box
* So, the cost of the cards from the second box is:
  * 6 cards x $1.75 per card = $10.50
* To find the total cost, we add the costs from the two boxes:
  * $7.50 + $10.50 = $18.00
