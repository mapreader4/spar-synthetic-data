Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The cost to fix the racecar is $20,000.
2. John gets a 20% discount on the $20,000 cost, which means he pays $16,000 to fix the car.
3. John wins the race and the prize is $70,000.
4. However, John only keeps 90% of the $70,000 prize, which is $63,000.
5. To calculate the money he made from the car, we take the $63,000 he kept from the race prize and subtract the $16,000 he paid to fix the car.

Answer: $47,000
