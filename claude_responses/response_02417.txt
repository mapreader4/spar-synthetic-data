Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Simeon drinks 64 fluid ounces of filtered water every day
* He used to drink this water in 8-ounce servings
* So, when he was drinking in 8-ounce servings, it would take him 64 / 8 = 8 servings per day
* Now, he drinks his water in 16-ounce servings
* So, when he is drinking in 16-ounce servings, it would take him 64 / 16 = 4 servings per day
* To find the difference in servings per day, we take the original 8 servings per day and subtract the new 4 servings per day:
* 8 servings per day - 4 servings per day = 4 fewer servings per day
