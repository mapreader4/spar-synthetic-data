Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The first bowl has a capacity equal to 3/4 the capacity of the second bowl.
2) The second bowl has 600 marbles.
3) To find the capacity of the first bowl, we can take 3/4 of the capacity of the second bowl:
   * Capacity of first bowl = 3/4 * 600 = 450 marbles
4) The total number of marbles both bowls are holding together is the sum of the marbles in the first bowl and the second bowl:
   * Total marbles = 450 + 600 = 1050 marbles

Answer: 1050
