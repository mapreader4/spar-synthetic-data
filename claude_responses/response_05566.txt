Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Annie walked 5 blocks from her house to the bus stop.
2) She then rode the bus 7 blocks to the coffee shop.
3) To get home, she retraced her steps, so she rode the bus 7 blocks back to the bus stop, and then walked 5 blocks back home.
4) In total, the distance she traveled is:
   - Walking to the bus stop: 5 blocks
   - Riding the bus to the coffee shop: 7 blocks
   - Riding the bus back to the bus stop: 7 blocks
   - Walking back home: 5 blocks
5) Adding all of these together, the total distance Annie traveled is:
   5 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 24 blocks
