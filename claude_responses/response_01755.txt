Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John's normal trip is 150 miles and takes 3 hours.
2) This means his normal speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.
3) He ended up driving 50 miles out of the way.
4) To get back on track, he had to drive an additional 50 miles.
5) So the total distance he drove was 150 miles + 50 miles + 50 miles = 250 miles.
6) Since he kept the same speed of 50 miles per hour, the total time for the trip would be 250 miles / 50 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Answer: 5 hours
