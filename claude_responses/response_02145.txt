Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Rudolph traveled 2 more than 5 miles on his trip across town
* This means he traveled 5 + 2 = 7 miles
* Rudolph encountered 3 less than 17 stop signs on his trip
* This means he encountered 17 - 3 = 14 stop signs
* To calculate the number of stop signs per mile, we divide the total number of stop signs by the total number of miles traveled
* 14 stop signs / 7 miles = 2 stop signs per mile
