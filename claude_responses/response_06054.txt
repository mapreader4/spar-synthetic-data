Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 20 fishermen in the lake
* 19 of them caught 400 fish each with their own net
* The total number of fish caught was 10,000

First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by the 19 fishermen who caught 400 fish each:
* 19 fishermen x 400 fish each = 7,600 fish

Now, we can subtract the total number of fish caught by the 19 fishermen from the total number of fish caught to find the number of fish caught by the 20th fisherman:
* 10,000 total fish - 7,600 fish caught by 19 fishermen = 2,400 fish caught by the 20th fisherman

Answer: 2,400
