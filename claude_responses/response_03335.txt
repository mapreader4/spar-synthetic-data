Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The average score on last week's Spanish test was 90.
2) Marco scored 10% less than the average test score.
   - 10% of 90 is 9.
   - So Marco's score was 90 - 9 = 81.
3) Margaret received 5 more points than Marco.
   - Marco's score was 81.
   - Margaret's score was 81 + 5 = 86.

Answer: 86
