Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The school has 1000 students.
2) Half of the students were taken on a trip to the nearby beach. That means 1000 / 2 = 500 students were taken on the trip.
3) That leaves 1000 - 500 = 500 students remaining in the school.
4) Half of the remaining 500 students were sent home. That means 500 / 2 = 250 students were sent home.
5) Therefore, the number of students still in the school is 500 - 250 = 250.

Answer: 250
