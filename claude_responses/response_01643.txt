Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Valerie needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb
* Small light bulbs cost $8 each
* Large light bulbs cost $12 each
* Valerie has $60 to spend

First, let's calculate the total cost of the light bulbs:
* 3 small light bulbs x $8 = $24
* 1 large light bulb x $12 = $12
* Total cost = $24 + $12 = $36

Now, we can calculate how much money Valerie will have left over:
* Valerie has $60 to spend
* Total cost of light bulbs is $36
* $60 - $36 = $24

Therefore, Valerie will have $24 left over.

Answer: 24
