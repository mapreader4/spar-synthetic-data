Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Robie initially bought 3 bags of chocolates
* She gave 2 of those bags to her brothers and sisters
* That means she had 1 bag of chocolates left after giving away the 2 bags
* Robie then bought another 3 bags of chocolates
* So the total number of bags of chocolates she had at this point is 1 (the one she had left) + 3 (the new ones she bought) = 4 bags

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 4
