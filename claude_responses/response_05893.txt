To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of balloons that can be inflated by the three people in the given time.

Given information:
- Mary inflates 10 balloons per minute.
- Jess inflates 7 balloons per minute.
- Christina inflates 4 balloons per minute and arrived 15 minutes late.
- They have 30 minutes to inflate the balloons.

Step 1: Calculate the number of balloons inflated by Mary.
Mary's balloons per minute × Time available = Total balloons inflated by Mary
10 balloons per minute × 30 minutes = 300 balloons

Step 2: Calculate the number of balloons inflated by Jess.
Jess's balloons per minute × Time available = Total balloons inflated by Jess
7 balloons per minute × 30 minutes = 210 balloons

Step 3: Calculate the number of balloons inflated by Christina.
Christina's balloons per minute × Time available (after arriving 15 minutes late) = Total balloons inflated by Christina
4 balloons per minute × 15 minutes = 60 balloons

Step 4: Calculate the total number of balloons inflated by the three people.
Total balloons inflated = Balloons inflated by Mary + Balloons inflated by Jess + Balloons inflated by Christina
Total balloons inflated = 300 + 210 + 60 = 570 balloons

Answer: 570 balloons
