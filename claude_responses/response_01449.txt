Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Saturday, Erica saw 3 lions and 2 elephants
* On Sunday, Erica saw 2 buffaloes and 5 leopards
* On Monday, Erica saw 5 rhinos and 3 warthogs

To find the total number of animals Erica saw, we need to add up the animals from each day:
* Saturday: 3 lions + 2 elephants = 5 animals
* Sunday: 2 buffaloes + 5 leopards = 7 animals
* Monday: 5 rhinos + 3 warthogs = 8 animals

Now we add up the total animals from all three days:
* 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 animals

Answer: 20
