Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leila donated 2 bags with 25 toys in each bag
* So, Leila's total donation is 2 x 25 = 50 toys
* Mohamed donated 3 bags with 19 toys in each bag
* So, Mohamed's total donation is 3 x 19 = 57 toys
* To find how many more toys Mohamed donated, we subtract Leila's donation from Mohamed's donation:
* 57 toys (Mohamed) - 50 toys (Leila) = 7 more toys
