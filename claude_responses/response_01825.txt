Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tom has had pet insurance for 24 months, and it costs $20 per month.
   * Total cost of the insurance over 24 months = $20 x 24 = $480

2. The procedure cost $5000, and the insurance covers all but 20% of this.
   * Amount covered by the insurance = $5000 x 0.8 = $4000
   * Amount Tom has to pay = $5000 x 0.2 = $1000

3. To calculate the money Tom saved by having insurance, we need to subtract the total cost of the insurance from the amount covered by the insurance.
   * Money saved = Amount covered by the insurance - Total cost of the insurance
   * Money saved = $4000 - $480 = $3520

Answer: $3520
