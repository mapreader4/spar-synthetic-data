Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We are given that Ryanne is 7 years older than Hezekiah.
2) We are also given that the sum of their ages is 15 years.
3) Let's represent Hezekiah's age as x.
4) Since Ryanne is 7 years older than Hezekiah, Ryanne's age can be represented as x + 7.
5) The sum of their ages is 15 years, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 7) = 15
6) Solving this equation:
2x + 7 = 15
2x = 8
x = 4
7) Therefore, Hezekiah is 4 years old.
