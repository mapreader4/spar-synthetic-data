Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Holly drinks 8 ounces of chocolate milk for breakfast
* During her lunch break, she buys a 64-ounce container of chocolate milk and drinks 8 ounces of it
* With dinner, she drinks another 8 ounces of chocolate milk
* At the end of the day, she has 56 ounces of chocolate milk left

To find out how many ounces of chocolate milk she began the day with, we need to add up all the chocolate milk she drank throughout the day and then add that to the 56 ounces she has left.

* Breakfast: 8 ounces
* Lunch: 8 ounces
* Dinner: 8 ounces
* Total chocolate milk drank: 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 ounces

Now we add the 24 ounces drank to the 56 ounces she has left:
* 24 ounces + 56 ounces = 80 ounces

Answer: 80 ounces
