Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* An adult panda can eat 138 pounds of bamboo per day
* A baby panda can eat 50 pounds of bamboo per day
* We want to know how many pounds of bamboo the pandas will eat in a week

To calculate the total, we need to:
1. Determine how many adult pandas and baby pandas there are
2. Multiply the daily consumption of each type of panda by the number of days in a week (7 days)
3. Add the total consumption of the adult pandas and baby pandas together

Let's assume there is 1 adult panda and 1 baby panda.

Adult panda consumption per week:
* 138 pounds per day x 7 days = 966 pounds

Baby panda consumption per week: 
* 50 pounds per day x 7 days = 350 pounds

Total bamboo consumption per week:
* 966 pounds + 350 pounds = 1,316 pounds

Answer: 1,316 pounds
