Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Hamza has 3-liter, 5-liter, and 6-liter buckets.
2) She fills the 5-liter bucket and pours as much as she can into the 3-liter bucket.
3) The 3-liter bucket can hold 3 liters, so she pours 3 liters from the 5-liter bucket into the 3-liter bucket.
4) This leaves 2 liters remaining in the 5-liter bucket.
5) Hamza then pours the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter bucket into the 6-liter bucket.
6) The 6-liter bucket can hold 6 liters, so there is 4 liters of space remaining in the 6-liter bucket.

Answer: 4 liters
