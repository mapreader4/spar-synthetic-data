Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brian read one book with 20 chapters
* He read two books with 15 chapters each
* So the two books with 15 chapters each had a total of 2 * 15 = 30 chapters
* He also read one book that had half the chapters of the three previous books put together
* The three previous books had a total of 20 + 30 = 50 chapters
* The fourth book had half the chapters of the three previous books, which is 50 / 2 = 25 chapters

Now, to find the total number of chapters Brian read, we add up the chapters from all four books:
* 20 + 30 + 25 = 75 chapters

Answer: 75
