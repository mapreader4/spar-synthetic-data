Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The school has a total of 80 students
* 40% of the students are in class A
* To find the number of students in class A, we take 40% of the total students:
    * 40% of 80 = 0.4 * 80 = 32 students in class A
* Class B has 21 students fewer than class A
    * So, class B has 32 - 21 = 11 students
* The remaining students must be in class C
    * To find the number of students in class C, we subtract the students in class A and B from the total:
    * 80 - 32 - 11 = 37 students in class C

Answer: 37
