Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emily has 20 high school credits
* Spencer has half the number of credits as Emily, so Spencer has 10 credits (20 / 2 = 10)
* Aria has twice the number of credits as Emily, so Aria has 40 credits (20 x 2 = 40)

Now, to find the total number of credits the three have:
* Emily has 20 credits
* Spencer has 10 credits
* Aria has 40 credits
* Total credits = 20 + 10 + 40 = 70 credits

To find twice the total number of credits, we multiply 70 by 2:
* Twice the total number of credits = 70 x 2 = 140

Answer: 140
