Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Charles earns $15 per hour when he housesits.
2) He housesits for 10 hours.
3) So, the amount he earns from housesitting is:
   $15 per hour x 10 hours = $150
4) Charles earns $22 per hour when he walks a dog.
5) He walks 3 dogs.
6) So, the amount he earns from walking the dogs is:
   $22 per hour x 3 hours = $66
7) To calculate the total amount Charles earns, we add the amounts from housesitting and walking the dogs:
   $150 + $66 = $216

Answer: $216
