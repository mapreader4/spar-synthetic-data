Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lilibeth fills 6 baskets, and each basket holds 50 strawberries.
2) So the total number of strawberries Lilibeth picks is:
6 baskets x 50 strawberries per basket = 300 strawberries
3) Lilibeth's three friends each pick the same amount as her, which is 300 strawberries each.
4) So the total number of strawberries picked by Lilibeth and her three friends is:
Lilibeth's 300 strawberries + 3 friends x 300 strawberries each = 300 + 900 = 1,200 strawberries

Answer: 1,200
