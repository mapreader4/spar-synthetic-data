Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Michael has $50 to start with.
2) He wants to buy:
   - A cake for $20
   - A bouquet for $36
   - A set of balloons for $5
3) To calculate the total cost of the items, we add up the individual costs:
   - Cake: $20
   - Bouquet: $36
   - Balloons: $5
   - Total cost: $20 + $36 + $5 = $61
4) Now we need to compare the total cost to the amount of money Michael has.
   - Michael has $50
   - The total cost is $61
5) To find how much more money Michael needs, we subtract the amount he has ($50) from the total cost ($61):
   - $61 - $50 = $11

Answer: $11
