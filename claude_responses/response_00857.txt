Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah bought 6 paperback books and 4 hardback books
* Her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah
* To find the number of paperback books her brother bought:
  - Sarah bought 6 paperback books
  - One-third of 6 is 2
  - Therefore, her brother bought 2 paperback books
* Her brother bought two times the number of hardback books that Sarah bought
* Sarah bought 4 hardback books
* Two times 4 is 8
* Therefore, her brother bought 8 hardback books
* To find the total number of books her brother bought, we add the paperback and hardback books:
  - 2 paperback books + 8 hardback books = 10 books
