Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The eagle can fly 15 miles per hour
* The eagle flew for 2 hours
* So the eagle flew 15 miles per hour * 2 hours = 30 miles
* The falcon can fly 46 miles per hour
* The falcon flew for 2 hours
* So the falcon flew 46 miles per hour * 2 hours = 92 miles
* The pelican can fly 33 miles per hour
* The pelican flew for 2 hours
* So the pelican flew 33 miles per hour * 2 hours = 66 miles
* The hummingbird can fly 30 miles per hour
* The hummingbird flew for 2 hours
* So the hummingbird flew 30 miles per hour * 2 hours = 60 miles

To find the total distance flown by all the birds, we add up the distances for each bird:
* Total distance = 30 miles + 92 miles + 66 miles + 60 miles = 248 miles

Answer: 248
