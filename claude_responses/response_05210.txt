Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There is 80 mg of caffeine in a cup of coffee.
2) Lisa does not want to drink more than 200 mg of caffeine per day.
3) Lisa drinks three cups of coffee.
4) To calculate the total amount of caffeine Lisa drank, we multiply the number of cups (3) by the amount of caffeine per cup (80 mg):
3 cups x 80 mg/cup = 240 mg of caffeine
5) Now, we need to calculate how much caffeine Lisa drank over her goal of 200 mg. We do this by subtracting her goal from the total amount of caffeine she drank:
240 mg - 200 mg = 40 mg

Answer: 40 mg
