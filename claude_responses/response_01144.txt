Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Michael's oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger.
   * Let's say Michael's current age is x.
   * When Michael was a year younger, his age was x-1.
   * Twice Michael's age when he was a year younger is 2(x-1).
   * The oldest brother is 1 year older than this, so his age is 2(x-1) + 1.

2. Michael's younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother.
   * The older brother's age is 2(x-1) + 1.
   * A third of the older brother's age is (2(x-1) + 1) / 3 = 5.
   * Solving this, we get x = 8.

3. Now we can calculate the combined age of the three brothers:
   * Michael's age is 8.
   * The older brother's age is 2(8-1) + 1 = 15.
   * The younger brother's age is 5.
   * The combined age is 8 + 15 + 5 = 28.

Answer: 28
