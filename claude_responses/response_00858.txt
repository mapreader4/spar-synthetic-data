Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The recommended intake of added sugar for men is 150 calories per day.
2) Mark's soft drink contained 2500 calories, 5% of which was from added sugar.
   * 5% of 2500 calories = 0.05 * 2500 = 125 calories of added sugar from the soft drink.
3) Mark then bought some bars of candy, each containing 25 calories of added sugar.
4) Mark eventually exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%.
   * The recommended intake is 150 calories.
   * 100% more than 150 calories is 150 * 2 = 300 calories.
   * So Mark consumed a total of 150 + 300 = 450 calories of added sugar.
5) We need to find how many bars of candy Mark bought to reach the 450 calories of added sugar.
   * We know he consumed 125 calories from the soft drink.
   * So the remaining added sugar he consumed from the candy bars is 450 - 125 = 325 calories.
   * Each candy bar has 25 calories of added sugar.
   * 325 calories / 25 calories per bar = 13 bars of candy.
