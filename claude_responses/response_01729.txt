Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Calvin has 12 giant roaches
* Calvin has 3 scorpions
* Calvin has half as many crickets as roaches, which means he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets
* Calvin has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions, which means he has 3 * 2 = 6 caterpillars

Now, to find the total number of insects in Calvin's collection, we add up all the insects:
* 12 giant roaches + 3 scorpions + 6 crickets + 6 caterpillars = 27 insects

Answer: 27
