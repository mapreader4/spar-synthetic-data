Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Plane ticket cost for each person: $24
* Hotel stay cost for each person per day: $12
* They are staying for 3 days

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay, then add them together.

Cost of plane tickets:
* 2 plane tickets at $24 each = $48

Cost of hotel stay:
* 2 people staying for 3 days at $12 per day = $72

Total cost:
* Cost of plane tickets + Cost of hotel stay = $48 + $72 = $120

Answer: 120
