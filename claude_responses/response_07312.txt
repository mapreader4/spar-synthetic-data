Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Trevor has drawn 220 pages of the comic in the past three months
* The comic releases a new issue once a month
* The first and second months' issues were the same number of pages
* The third month's issue was four pages longer than either of the others

We can represent the number of pages in each issue as follows:
* First month's issue: x pages
* Second month's issue: x pages
* Third month's issue: x + 4 pages

The total number of pages drawn in the past three months is 220, so we can set up an equation:
* x + x + (x + 4) = 220

Solving for x, we get:
* 3x + 4 = 220
* 3x = 216
* x = 72

Therefore, the first issue of the comic was 72 pages.

Answer: 72
