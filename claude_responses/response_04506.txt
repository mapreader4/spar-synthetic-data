Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jean is wanted on 3 counts of arson, with each arson count having a 36-month sentence.
2) Jean is also wanted on 2 burglary charges, with each burglary charge being 18 months.
3) Jean is also wanted on six times as many petty larceny charges as burglary charges. 
4) Each petty larceny charge is 1/3rd as long as a burglary charge, which means each petty larceny charge is 6 months.
5) To calculate the total number of petty larceny charges, we take 2 burglary charges and multiply by 6, which gives us 12 petty larceny charges.

Now, let's add up the total sentence:
* 3 arson counts at 36 months each = 108 months
* 2 burglary charges at 18 months each = 36 months 
* 12 petty larceny charges at 6 months each = 72 months

Adding these up, the total sentence Jean is facing is:
Answer: 216 months
