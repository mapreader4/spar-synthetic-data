Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Lucas has 12 pet beds in his room already
* He can fit another 8 pet beds in his room
* So the total number of pet beds he can have is 12 + 8 = 20 pet beds
* His parents argue that each pet needs 2 beds to feel comfortable
* So the number of pets he can have is the total number of pet beds divided by 2
* 20 pet beds / 2 beds per pet = 10 pets

Answer: 10
