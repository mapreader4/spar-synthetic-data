Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The judge oversaw 17 court cases
* 2 cases were immediately dismissed
* That leaves 17 - 2 = 15 remaining cases
* Two-thirds of the remaining 15 cases were ruled innocent
* Two-thirds of 15 is 10 cases that were ruled innocent
* That leaves 15 - 10 = 5 cases that were not ruled innocent
* 1 of those 5 cases had a delayed ruling
* That leaves 4 cases that were ruled guilty

Answer: 4
