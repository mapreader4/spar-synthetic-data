Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pie shop charges $5 for a slice of pie
* Each whole pie is cut into 4 slices
* The pie shop is selling 9 pies

To calculate the total money the pie shop will make, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of slices sold
2. Multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices sold
* Each pie is cut into 4 slices
* The pie shop is selling 9 pies
* Total number of slices = 9 pies x 4 slices per pie = 36 slices

Step 2: Multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice
* Price per slice = $5
* Total money made = 36 slices x $5 per slice = $180

Answer: $180
