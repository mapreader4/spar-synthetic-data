Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Grover bought 3 boxes of face masks, and each box has 20 face masks.
2) So the total number of face masks Grover bought is 3 boxes x 20 face masks per box = 60 face masks.
3) Grover bought the 3 boxes for $15.
4) Grover plans to sell each face mask for $0.50.
5) So the total revenue Grover will get from selling all 60 face masks is 60 face masks x $0.50 per face mask = $30.
6) Grover's total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
7) The total cost is $15, so the total profit is $30 - $15 = $15.
