Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jennifer has 212 green sweets, 310 blue sweets, and 502 yellow sweets.
2) She wants to share these sweets equally between herself and her 3 friends, so there will be a total of 4 people sharing the sweets.
3) To find the number of sweets each person will get, we need to add up the total number of sweets and divide by 4.
4) The total number of sweets is 212 + 310 + 502 = 1024.
5) Dividing 1024 by 4, we get 1024 / 4 = 256.

Answer: 256
