Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Lopez needs to buy tickets for:
  - Her husband (adult ticket)
  - Herself (adult ticket)
  - Her parents (2 senior citizen tickets)
  - Her 3 children (3 children's tickets)
* Adult tickets cost $11 each
* Children's tickets cost $8 each
* Senior citizen tickets cost $9 each
* So the total cost would be:
  - 2 adult tickets at $11 each = $22
  - 2 senior citizen tickets at $9 each = $18
  - 3 children's tickets at $8 each = $24
* Adding these up:
  - $22 + $18 + $24 = $64

Answer: $64
