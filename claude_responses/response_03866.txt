Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bicycle shop owner adds 3 bikes to her stock every week
* After 1 month (4 weeks), she had sold 18 bikes
* She still had 45 bikes in stock

To find the original number of bikes, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of bikes added to the stock over the 4 weeks:
   * 3 bikes per week x 4 weeks = 12 bikes added
2. Calculate the total number of bikes in the stock after the 4 weeks:
   * Original number of bikes + 12 bikes added - 18 bikes sold = 45 bikes in stock
3. Solve for the original number of bikes:
   * Original number of bikes = 45 bikes in stock + 18 bikes sold - 12 bikes added
   * Original number of bikes = 45 + 18 - 12 = 51 bikes

Answer: 51
