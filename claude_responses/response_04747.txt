Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away
* In January, he gave away 53 toothbrushes
* In February, he gave away 67 toothbrushes
* In March, he gave away 46 toothbrushes
* In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month

First, let's calculate the total number of toothbrushes given away in the first 3 months:
* 53 + 67 + 46 = 166 toothbrushes

Now, let's calculate the remaining toothbrushes:
* 330 - 166 = 164 toothbrushes

Since he gave away the remaining toothbrushes in April and May, he gave away 82 toothbrushes in each of those months.

The busiest month was February, when he gave away 67 toothbrushes.
The slowest month was March, when he gave away 46 toothbrushes.

To find the difference between the busiest and slowest months, we subtract:
* 67 - 46 = 21 toothbrushes

Answer: 21
