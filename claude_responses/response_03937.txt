Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Paula buys:
   - 2 bracelets at $4 each = 2 x $4 = $8
   - 1 keychain at $5 each = 1 x $5 = $5
   - Total for Paula = $8 + $5 = $13

2. Olive buys:
   - 1 coloring book at $3 each = 1 x $3 = $3
   - 1 bracelet at $4 each = 1 x $4 = $4
   - Total for Olive = $3 + $4 = $7

3. To find the total amount spent by Paula and Olive, we add their individual totals:
   - Total spent = Paula's total + Olive's total
   - Total spent = $13 + $7 = $20

Answer: $20
