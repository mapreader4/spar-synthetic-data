Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jane picked 64 apples at the orchard.
2) She sorted them into 4 different baskets to send to her friends.
3) This means each basket originally had 64 / 4 = 16 apples.
4) Jane's sister then took 3 apples from each of the 4 baskets.
5) So the total number of apples taken by the sister is 3 x 4 = 12 apples.
6) The remaining number of apples in each basket is 16 - 3 = 13 apples.

Answer: 13
