Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brianne saves $10 in January
* Each month, she saves twice as much as her previous month's savings
* So in February, she will save 2 x $10 = $20
* In March, she will save 2 x $20 = $40
* In April, she will save 2 x $40 = $80
* In May, she will save 2 x $80 = $160

Answer: 160
