Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Telegraph Road is 162 kilometers long.
2) Pardee Road is 12000 meters long.
3) To compare the lengths, we need to convert the length of Pardee Road from meters to kilometers.
4) 12000 meters = 12 kilometers.
5) Telegraph Road is 162 kilometers long, and Pardee Road is 12 kilometers long.
6) To find the difference in length, we subtract the length of Pardee Road from the length of Telegraph Road:
162 kilometers - 12 kilometers = 150 kilometers.

Answer: 150 kilometers
