Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 10 students who bought pencils
* The first 2 students bought 2 pencils each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 pencils
* The next 6 students bought 3 pencils each, so that's 6 x 3 = 18 pencils
* The last 2 students bought 1 pencil each, so that's 2 x 1 = 2 pencils
* To get the total number of pencils sold, we add up the pencils from each group:
4 + 18 + 2 = 24 pencils

Answer: 24
