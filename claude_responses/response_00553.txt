Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emma buys 2 containers of milk every school day
* She does not go to school on the weekends
* We need to find out how many containers of milk she buys in 3 weeks

First, let's calculate how many school days are in 3 weeks:
* There are 5 school days in a week
* 3 weeks = 15 school days

Now, we can calculate the number of containers of milk she buys in 3 weeks:
* Emma buys 2 containers of milk per school day
* In 15 school days, she buys 2 x 15 = 30 containers of milk

Answer: 30
