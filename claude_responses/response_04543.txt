Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah interviewed 450 students
* 70 students said they liked oranges
* 120 students said they liked pears
* 147 students said they liked apples
* We need to find how many students picked strawberries as their favorite fruit

To find the number of students who picked strawberries, we can subtract the number of students who picked the other fruits from the total number of students interviewed:
* Total students interviewed: 450
* Students who picked oranges: 70
* Students who picked pears: 120
* Students who picked apples: 147
* Total students who picked the other fruits: 70 + 120 + 147 = 337
* Students who picked strawberries: 450 - 337 = 113

Answer: 113
