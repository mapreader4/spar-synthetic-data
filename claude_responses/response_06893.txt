Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Samuel took 30 minutes to finish his homework
* Sarah took 1.3 hours to finish the same homework
* To convert 1.3 hours to minutes, we multiply 1.3 by 60 minutes per hour:
* 1.3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 78 minutes
* So Sarah took 78 minutes to finish the homework
* To find how many minutes faster Samuel finished the homework, we subtract Samuel's time from Sarah's time:
* 78 minutes (Sarah's time) - 30 minutes (Samuel's time) = 48 minutes

Answer: 48
