Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total cost of Olivia's groceries was $42.
* The bananas cost her $12.
* The bread cost her $9.
* The milk cost her $7.
* The only other groceries she bought were apples.

To find the cost of the apples, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total cost:
* Total cost: $42
* Bananas: $12
* Bread: $9
* Milk: $7
* Total cost of other items: $12 + $9 + $7 = $28
* Cost of apples: $42 - $28 = $14

Answer: $14
