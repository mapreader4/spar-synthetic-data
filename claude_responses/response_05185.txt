Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shelly catches 2 less than 5 swordfish each time they go fishing
* So Shelly catches 5 - 2 = 3 swordfish each time
* Sam catches one less swordfish than Shelly
* So Sam catches 3 - 1 = 2 swordfish each time
* They go fishing 5 times
* For each fishing trip:
    - Shelly catches 3 swordfish
    - Sam catches 2 swordfish
* So for 5 fishing trips:
    - Shelly catches 3 x 5 = 15 swordfish
    - Sam catches 2 x 5 = 10 swordfish
* The total number of swordfish caught is the sum of Shelly's and Sam's catches:
    - 15 + 10 = 25 swordfish

Answer: 25
