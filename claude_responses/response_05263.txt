Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The car costs $2,100 in total
* Sue's sister will drive the car 4 days a week
* Sue will drive the car for the remaining days

To calculate how much Sue has to pay, we need to find the percentage of days she will use the car.

* There are 7 days in a week
* Sue's sister uses the car for 4 days a week
* Sue uses the car for the remaining 7 - 4 = 3 days a week

Therefore, the percentage of days Sue uses the car is:
* 3 days / 7 days = 42.86%

Now we can calculate how much Sue has to pay:
* 42.86% of $2,100 = 0.4286 * $2,100 = $900

Answer: $900
