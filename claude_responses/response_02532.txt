Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kaiden collected 158 cans during the first week.
2) Kaiden collected 259 cans during the second week.
3) So the total number of cans Kaiden has collected so far is 158 + 259 = 417 cans.
4) Kaiden's goal is to collect 500 cans.
5) To find the number of additional cans Kaiden needs to collect, we subtract the number of cans he has already collected from his goal:
500 - 417 = 83 cans.

Answer: 83
