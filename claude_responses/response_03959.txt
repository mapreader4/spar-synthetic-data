To solve this problem, we need to find the price per kilogram of oranges and then use it to calculate the total cost for 12 kg of oranges.

Given information:
- Annie paid $6 for 2 kg of oranges.

Step 1: Find the price per kilogram of oranges.
Price per kilogram = Total cost / Total mass
Price per kilogram = $6 / 2 kg = $3 per kg

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 12 kg of oranges.
Total cost = Price per kilogram × Total mass
Total cost = $3 per kg × 12 kg = $36

Answer: $36
