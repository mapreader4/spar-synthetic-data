Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Simon collected a bucket of pearly seashells, a jar full of smooth sea glass, and a bag of ten sand dollars.
2) The jar holds three times as many pieces of glass as the bag does sand dollars. So if the bag has 10 sand dollars, the jar has 3 * 10 = 30 pieces of glass.
3) The bucket holds five times as many seashells as the jar holds pieces of glass. So if the jar has 30 pieces of glass, the bucket has 5 * 30 = 150 seashells.
4) To find the total number of treasures Simon found, we add up the number of sand dollars, pieces of glass, and seashells:
10 sand dollars + 30 pieces of glass + 150 seashells = 190 treasures.

Answer: 190
