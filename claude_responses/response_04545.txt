Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackson is currently 20 years old
* Mandy is 10 years older than Jackson, so Mandy is currently 30 years old
* Adele is 3/4 as old as Jackson, so Adele is currently 15 years old (3/4 * 20 = 15)
* We want to find the total of their ages 10 years from now

In 10 years:
* Jackson will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old
* Mandy will be 30 + 10 = 40 years old
* Adele will be 15 + 10 = 25 years old

The total of their ages 10 years from now will be:
* 30 + 40 + 25 = 95

Answer: 95
