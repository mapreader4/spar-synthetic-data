Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Binkie has four times as many gemstones on his collar as Frankie.
2) Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones on her collar as Frankie.
3) Spaatz has 1 gemstone on her collar.
4) Since Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones as Frankie, and Spaatz has 1 gemstone, we can calculate the number of gemstones Frankie has:
   - Spaatz has half as many gemstones as Frankie, minus 2.
   - So Frankie has 2 x (1 + 2) = 6 gemstones.
5) Since Binkie has four times as many gemstones as Frankie, and Frankie has 6 gemstones, Binkie has 4 x 6 = 24 gemstones.

Answer: 24
