Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The shrink ray device causes anything it is used on to shrink by 50%.
2) The scientist's wife was carrying a tray with 5 cups of coffee, each containing 8 ounces of fluid.
3) After being shrink zapped, the cups and the coffee inside them would have been reduced by 50%.
4) To calculate the remaining ounces of coffee, we need to take the original amount of coffee and divide it by 2 (since it was reduced by 50%).
5) The original amount of coffee was 5 cups x 8 ounces per cup = 40 ounces.
6) After being shrink zapped, the remaining amount of coffee would be 40 ounces / 2 = 20 ounces.

Answer: 20 ounces
