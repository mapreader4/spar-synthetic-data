Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Angela has 20 problems total
* Martha has finished 2 problems
* Jenna has finished 4 times the number Martha did, minus 2
   - So Jenna has finished 4 * 2 - 2 = 6 problems
* Mark has finished half the number Jenna did
   - So Mark has finished 6 / 2 = 3 problems

Now, we need to find the number of problems that no one but Angela has finished.
* Total problems finished by the friends = 2 + 6 + 3 = 11
* Problems finished by Angela only = 20 - 11 = 9

Answer: 9
