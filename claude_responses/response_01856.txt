Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Danny brings 3 watermelons to the picnic.
2) Each of Danny's watermelons is cut into 10 slices.
3) So the total number of slices from Danny's watermelons is:
3 watermelons x 10 slices per watermelon = 30 slices
4) Danny's sister brings 1 watermelon to the picnic.
5) She cuts her watermelon into 15 slices.
6) So the total number of slices from the sister's watermelon is:
1 watermelon x 15 slices per watermelon = 15 slices
7) To get the total number of watermelon slices at the picnic, we add the slices from Danny's watermelons and the sister's watermelon:
30 slices + 15 slices = 45 slices

Answer: 45
