Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary starts with 40 ounces of raw spinach.
2) She cooks the spinach until it's 20% of its initial volume. This means the cooked spinach volume is 20% of 40 ounces, which is 8 ounces.
3) She then mixes the 8 ounces of cooked spinach with 6 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of eggs.
4) The total volume of the ingredients is 8 ounces (spinach) + 6 ounces (cream cheese) + 4 ounces (eggs) = 18 ounces.

Answer: 18 ounces
