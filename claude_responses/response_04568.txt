Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The casino table pays 3:2 for a blackjack with the first 2 cards.
2) This means that if you bet $1, you would receive $1.50 if you get a blackjack.
3) You were paid $60 for your blackjack.
4) To find your original bet, we can use the 3:2 payout ratio:
* If you bet $x and received $60, then $60 = 1.5x
* Solving for x, we get x = $60 / 1.5 = $40

Answer: $40
