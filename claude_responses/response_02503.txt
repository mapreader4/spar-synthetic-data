Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alden had 50 nephews ten years ago.
2) This is half the number of nephews Alden has now. So, the number of nephews Alden has now is 2 x 50 = 100.
3) Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden now. So, Vihaan has 100 + 60 = 160 nephews.
4) The total number of nephews that Alden and Vihaan have now is 100 + 160 = 260.

Answer: 260
