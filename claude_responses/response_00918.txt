Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) The house is 20.5 feet by 10 feet, so the area of the house is:
   Area of house = 20.5 feet x 10 feet = 205 square feet

2) The porch measures 6 feet by 4.5 feet, so the area of the porch is:
   Area of porch = 6 feet x 4.5 feet = 27 square feet

3) To find the total area that needs shingles, we add the area of the house and the area of the porch:
   Total area = Area of house + Area of porch
   Total area = 205 square feet + 27 square feet = 232 square feet

Answer: 232 square feet
