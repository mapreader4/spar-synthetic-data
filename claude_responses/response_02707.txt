Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Renaldo drove 15 kilometers.
2) Ernesto drove 7 kilometers more than one-third of Renaldo's distance.
3) To find one-third of Renaldo's distance, we divide 15 by 3, which is 5 kilometers.
4) Ernesto drove 7 kilometers more than 5 kilometers, which is 12 kilometers.
5) To find the total distance driven by the 2 men, we add Renaldo's distance (15 km) and Ernesto's distance (12 km).
Answer: 27 kilometers.
