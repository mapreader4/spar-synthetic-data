Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michelle bought 14 chocolate bars
* Each chocolate bar had 10 grams of sugar
* So the total sugar in the chocolate bars is:
    - 14 chocolate bars x 10 grams of sugar per bar = 140 grams of sugar
* Michelle also bought a giant lollipop
* The lollipop had an additional 37 grams of sugar
* So the total sugar in the lollipop is 37 grams
* To find the total sugar in all the candy she bought, we add the sugar from the chocolate bars and the lollipop:
    - 140 grams of sugar (from the chocolate bars) + 37 grams of sugar (from the lollipop) = 177 grams of sugar

Answer: 177 grams
