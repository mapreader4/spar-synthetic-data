Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The normal 18-month subscription costs $34.
2) The magazine is currently running a promotion for $0.25 off each twice-a-month issue.
3) There are 18 months in the subscription, and the magazine is published twice a month.
4) So there are 18 * 2 = 36 issues in the 18-month subscription.
5) With the promotion, each issue is $0.25 cheaper, so the total discount is 36 * $0.25 = $9.
6) Therefore, the promotional subscription is $34 - $9 = $25 cheaper than the normal subscription.

Answer: $25
