Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Leah bought 3 boxes of birdseed
* She already had 5 boxes in the pantry
* So, in total, she has 3 + 5 = 8 boxes of birdseed
* Each box contains 225 grams of seeds
* Her parrot eats 100 grams per week
* Her cockatiel eats 50 grams per week
* So, in total, her birds eat 100 + 50 = 150 grams per week
* To calculate how many weeks she can feed her birds, we need to divide the total amount of seeds by the weekly consumption:
* Total amount of seeds = 8 boxes x 225 grams/box = 1800 grams
* Weekly consumption = 150 grams/week
* Weeks of food = 1800 grams / 150 grams/week = 12 weeks
