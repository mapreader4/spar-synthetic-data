Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Mancino's Gardens:
* Mancino has 3 gardens
* Each garden measures 16 feet by 5 feet
* To find the area of each garden, we multiply the length and width:
  * 16 feet x 5 feet = 80 square feet per garden
* To find the total area of Mancino's gardens, we multiply the area of one garden by the number of gardens:
  * 80 square feet x 3 gardens = 240 square feet

Marquita's Gardens:
* Marquita has 2 gardens
* Each garden measures 8 feet by 4 feet
* To find the area of each garden, we multiply the length and width:
  * 8 feet x 4 feet = 32 square feet per garden
* To find the total area of Marquita's gardens, we multiply the area of one garden by the number of gardens:
  * 32 square feet x 2 gardens = 64 square feet

Total Area of All Gardens:
* To find the total area of all the gardens, we add the areas of Mancino's gardens and Marquita's gardens:
  * 240 square feet + 64 square feet = 304 square feet

Answer: 304
