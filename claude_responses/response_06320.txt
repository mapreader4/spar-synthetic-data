Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aaron has 4 brothers
* The number of Bennett's brothers is 2 less than twice the number of Aaron's brothers
* To find the number of Bennett's brothers, we need to:
    1. Multiply the number of Aaron's brothers by 2 (2 x 4 = 8)
    2. Subtract 2 from the result (8 - 2 = 6)
Therefore, the number of Bennett's brothers is 6.

Answer: 6
