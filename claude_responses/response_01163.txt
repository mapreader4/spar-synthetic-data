Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Trevor buys three bouquets of carnations.
2) The first bouquet has 9 carnations, and the second bouquet has 14 carnations.
3) The average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12.
4) To find the number of carnations in the third bouquet, we can use the formula for average:
Average = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)
5) Plugging in the values we have:
12 = (9 + 14 + x) / 3
6) Solving for x:
12 = (23 + x) / 3
36 = 23 + x
x = 13

Answer: 13 carnations were in the third bouquet.
