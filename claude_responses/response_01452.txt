To solve this problem, we need to find the time difference between when Abel and Alice reach the destination.

Given information:
- Abel's travel distance: 1000 miles
- Abel's travel speed: 50 miles per hour
- Alice's travel speed: 40 miles per hour
- Time difference between their departures: 1 hour

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for Abel to reach the destination.
Time taken by Abel = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Abel = 1000 miles / 50 miles per hour = 20 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Alice to reach the destination.
Time taken by Alice = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Alice = 1000 miles / 40 miles per hour = 25 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time difference between when Abel and Alice reach the destination.
Time difference = Time taken by Alice - Time taken by Abel
Time difference = 25 hours - 20 hours = 5 hours

Step 4: Convert the time difference from hours to minutes.
Time difference in minutes = 5 hours Ã— 60 minutes per hour = 300 minutes

Answer: 300 minutes
