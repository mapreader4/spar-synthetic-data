Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 30 students in total
* 10 of the students raised $20 each
* The remaining 20 students raised $30 each
* To calculate the total amount raised, we need to add up the contributions from the two groups:

1. Contribution from the 10 students who raised $20 each:
   * 10 students x $20 = $200

2. Contribution from the 20 students who raised $30 each:
   * 20 students x $30 = $600

3. Total amount raised:
   * $200 + $600 = $800

Answer: 800
