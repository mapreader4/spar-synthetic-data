Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, it rained 2 inches in the morning and 1 more inch later in the day, for a total of 3 inches.
* On Tuesday, it rained twice as much as Monday, which is 2 x 3 = 6 inches.
* On Wednesday, it did not rain.
* On Thursday, it rained 1 inch.
* On Friday, the total rainfall was equal to the combined total from Monday through Thursday, which is 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 10 inches.
* To calculate the daily average rain total for the week, we add up the total rainfall for the week and divide by the number of days:
* Total rainfall for the week = 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 20 inches
* Number of days in the week = 5
* Daily average rain total = 20 inches / 5 days = 4 inches

Answer: 4 inches
