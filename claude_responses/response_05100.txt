Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Malcolm buys 12 red lights
* He buys 3 times as many blue lights as red lights, so that's 3 x 12 = 36 blue lights
* He buys 6 green lights
* So the total number of colored lights he has bought so far is 12 + 36 + 6 = 54 lights
* He still has 5 colored lights left to buy
* So the total number of colored lights he needs is 54 + 5 = 59 lights
* Therefore, the number of white lights he had initially is 59 lights.

Answer: 59
