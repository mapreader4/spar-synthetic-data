Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The shipping cost has a flat fee of $5.00 plus an additional $0.80 per pound of weight.
2) The package weighs 5 pounds.
3) To calculate the total shipping cost, we need to add the flat fee and the weight-based cost:
   Flat fee: $5.00
   Weight-based cost: 5 pounds x $0.80 per pound = $4.00
4) Total shipping cost = Flat fee + Weight-based cost
   = $5.00 + $4.00
   = $9.00

Answer: $9
