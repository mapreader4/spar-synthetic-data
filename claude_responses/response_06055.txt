Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beatrix read 704 pages.
2) Cristobal read 15 more than three times the pages that Beatrix read.
3) To find the number of pages Cristobal read, we first need to find three times the number of pages Beatrix read.
4) Three times 704 pages is 2,112 pages.
5) Cristobal read 15 more than 2,112 pages, which is 2,127 pages.
6) To find how many more pages Cristobal read, we subtract the number of pages Beatrix read from the number of pages Cristobal read.
7) 2,127 pages - 704 pages = 1,423 pages.

Answer: 1,423
