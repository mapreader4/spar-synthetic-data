Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Leonard's purchases:
- 1 wallet at $50
- 2 pairs of sneakers at $100 each, so 2 x $100 = $200
Total for Leonard: $50 + $200 = $250

Michael's purchases:
- 1 backpack at $100
- 2 pairs of jeans at $50 each, so 2 x $50 = $100
Total for Michael: $100 + $100 = $200

Now, to find the total amount spent by Leonard and Michael, we add their individual totals:
Total spent = Leonard's total + Michael's total
Total spent = $250 + $200 = $450

Answer: 450
