Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 50 more pens than notebooks on the shelf
* There are 30 notebooks on the shelf
* To find the number of pens, we can add 50 to the number of notebooks:
* Number of pens = 30 notebooks + 50 = 80 pens
* Now, to find the total number of notebooks and pens, we add the number of notebooks and pens:
* Total number of notebooks and pens = 30 notebooks + 80 pens = 110

Answer: 110
