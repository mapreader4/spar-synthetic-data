Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chastity made 12 angel food cakes
* She placed the cakes in boxes and stacked them on the hood of her car
* A black crow came and knocked over half of the stack
* When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged
* The rest of the cakes were destroyed

First, let's calculate how many cakes were in the stack that the crow knocked over:
* Half of the original 12 cakes = 12 / 2 = 6 cakes

Next, let's calculate how many of the fallen cakes Chastity was able to pick up:
* Half of the 6 fallen cakes = 6 / 2 = 3 cakes

Finally, we can calculate the number of cakes that were destroyed:
* Total cakes in the stack that fell = 6
* Cakes that Chastity was able to pick up = 3
* Cakes that were destroyed = 6 - 3 = 3

Answer: 3 cakes were destroyed.
