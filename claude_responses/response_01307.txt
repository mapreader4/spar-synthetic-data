Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4.
2) Mark is four years older than Billy.
3) Billy is half Ana's age.
4) Ana will be 15 in 3 years, so Ana's current age is 12.
5) Since Billy is half Ana's age, Billy's current age is 6.
6) Since Mark is four years older than Billy, Mark's current age is 10.
7) Plugging this into the first equation, we get:
Sarah's age = 3 * 10 - 4 = 26.

Answer: 26.
