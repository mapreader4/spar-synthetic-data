Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that in two years, Ophelia will be four times as old as Lennon.
2) Lennon is currently 8 years old, so in two years he will be 10 years old.
3) If Ophelia is four times as old as Lennon in two years, that means she will be 4 * 10 = 40 years old.
4) Therefore, Ophelia's current age is 40 - 2 = 38 years old.

Answer: 38
