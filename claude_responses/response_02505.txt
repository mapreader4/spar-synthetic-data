Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The necklace is worth $34
* Bob bought a book that is $5 more expensive than the necklace, so the book costs $34 + $5 = $39
* Bob set a limit of $70 and decided not to spend more than that
* To calculate the total amount Bob spent, we add the cost of the necklace ($34) and the cost of the book ($39):
$34 + $39 = $73
* Now, we need to calculate how much over the $70 limit Bob spent:
$73 - $70 = $3

Answer: $3
