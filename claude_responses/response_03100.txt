Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 3 dogs in the backyard, each with a different preference: apples, blueberries, and bonnies.
2) The first dog, which likes apples, eats 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog.
3) The second dog, which likes blueberries, eats 3/4 times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog.
4) The third dog, which likes bonnies, ate 60 bonnies.
5) To find the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog, we can use the information about the third dog:
   - The third dog ate 60 bonnies
   - The second dog ate 3/4 times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog
   - So the second dog ate 3/4 * 60 = 45 blueberries
6) Now we can find the number of apples eaten by the first dog:
   - The first dog ate 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog
   - The second dog ate 45 blueberries
   - So the first dog ate 3 * 45 = 135 apples
7) To find the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs, we add up the number of apples, blueberries, and bonnies:
   - Apples: 135
   - Blueberries: 45
   - Bonnies: 60
   - Total: 135 + 45 + 60 = 240

Answer: 240
