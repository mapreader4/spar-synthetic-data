Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Darma can eat 20 peanuts in 15 seconds.
2) We want to find how many peanuts she can eat in 6 minutes.
3) 6 minutes is equal to 360 seconds.
4) We can set up a proportion to solve this:
20 peanuts / 15 seconds = x peanuts / 360 seconds
5) Cross-multiplying, we get:
20 * 360 = 15x
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = (20 * 360) / 15
7) x = 480 peanuts.

Answer: 480
