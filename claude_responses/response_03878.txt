Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 20 members in the group
* Each member sold an average of 8 candy bars
* Each candy bar costs $0.50

To calculate the total money earned, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of candy bars sold
2. Multiply the total number of candy bars sold by the cost per candy bar

Step 1: Total number of candy bars sold
* Each member sold an average of 8 candy bars
* There are 20 members in the group
* Total number of candy bars sold = 20 members x 8 candy bars per member = 160 candy bars

Step 2: Calculate the total money earned
* Each candy bar costs $0.50
* Total money earned = 160 candy bars x $0.50 per candy bar = $80

Answer: $80
