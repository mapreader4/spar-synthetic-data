Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The show Magic King was on the air for 10 seasons
* For the first half of the seasons (5 seasons), there were 20 episodes per season
* For the second half of the seasons (5 seasons), there were 25 episodes per season

To calculate the total number of episodes, we need to find the sum of the episodes for the first half and the second half of the seasons.

For the first half of the seasons:
* 5 seasons x 20 episodes per season = 100 episodes

For the second half of the seasons:
* 5 seasons x 25 episodes per season = 125 episodes

Now, we add the two together to get the total number of episodes:
* 100 episodes + 125 episodes = 225 episodes

Answer: 225
