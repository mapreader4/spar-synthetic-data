Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first knife costs $5.00 to sharpen
* The next 3 knives cost $4.00 each, so that's 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
* The remaining 5 knives cost $3.00 each, so that's 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
* To calculate the total cost, we add up the costs for the first knife, the next 3 knives, and the remaining 5 knives:
$5.00 + $12.00 + $15.00 = $32.00

Answer: 32
