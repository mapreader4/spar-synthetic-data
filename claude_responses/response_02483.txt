Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Josie received $50 as a gift
* She plans to buy:
  - 2 cassette tapes that cost $9 each
  - 1 headphone set that costs $25
* To calculate the total cost of her purchases:
  - 2 cassette tapes at $9 each = 2 x $9 = $18
  - 1 headphone set at $25 = $25
  - Total cost = $18 + $25 = $43
* To calculate the amount of money Josie will have left:
  - She received $50
  - She spent $43
  - Amount left = $50 - $43 = $7
