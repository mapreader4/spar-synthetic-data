Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tamara's height is 3 times Kim's height, less 4 inches.
   Let's represent Kim's height as x.
   Then, Tamara's height is 3x - 4.
2) Tamara and Kim have a combined height of 92 inches.
   So, Tamara's height (3x - 4) plus Kim's height (x) equals 92 inches.
   3x - 4 + x = 92
   4x - 4 = 92
   4x = 96
   x = 24
3) Since Kim's height is 24 inches, Tamara's height is:
   Tamara's height = 3x - 4
   Tamara's height = 3(24) - 4
   Tamara's height = 72 - 4
   Tamara's height = 68 inches.

Answer: 68 inches.
