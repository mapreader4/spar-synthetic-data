Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ashley had already blown up 12 balloons
* Andy started blowing up balloons at a rate of 2 every 5 minutes
* When Andy stopped, there were 50 balloons in total

To find how long Andy blew up balloons, we need to calculate the number of balloons he added to the 12 that Ashley had already blown up.

The total number of balloons when Andy stopped is 50.
The number of balloons Ashley had already blown up is 12.
Therefore, the number of balloons Andy blew up is 50 - 12 = 38.

Now, we know that Andy blew up balloons at a rate of 2 every 5 minutes.
To find how many minutes it took him to blow up 38 balloons, we can set up a proportion:
2 balloons / 5 minutes = 38 balloons / x minutes
Solving for x, we get:
x = (38 * 5) / 2 = 95 minutes

Therefore, Andy blew up balloons for 95 minutes.

Answer: 95
