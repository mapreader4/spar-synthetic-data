Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The tornado picked up the Smith's car and transported it 200 feet in the air before dropping it into the neighbors' pool.
* The lawn chair had been blown twice as far as the car had been transported.
* So, the lawn chair had been blown 200 * 2 = 400 feet.
* The birdhouse had flown through the air three times farther than the lawn chair had been blown.
* So, the birdhouse had flown 400 * 3 = 1,200 feet.

Answer: 1,200 feet
