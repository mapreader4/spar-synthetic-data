Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The ranch currently has 200 cows
* Every year, the number of cows increases by half the number of cows living on the ranch
* The rancher does not buy or sell any cows

Year 1:
* The number of cows increases by half the current number of cows
* 1/2 * 200 = 100 new cows
* So the total number of cows after Year 1 is 200 + 100 = 300 cows

Year 2:
* The number of cows increases by half the current number of cows
* 1/2 * 300 = 150 new cows
* So the total number of cows after Year 2 is 300 + 150 = 450 cows

Answer: 450 cows
