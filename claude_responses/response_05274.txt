Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom's car gets 50 miles per gallon.
2) Tom drives 75 miles per day.
3) Gas costs $3 per gallon.
4) We want to find how much Tom spends on gas in 10 days.
To calculate this, we need to find how many gallons of gas Tom uses in 10 days.
* Tom drives 75 miles per day.
* In 10 days, he will drive 75 miles x 10 days = 750 miles.
* Since his car gets 50 miles per gallon, he will use 750 miles / 50 miles per gallon = 15 gallons of gas.
* At $3 per gallon, 15 gallons of gas will cost 15 gallons x $3 per gallon = $45.

Answer: $45
