Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Each boat is 3 feet across.
2) There must be at least 2 feet between each boat or the riverbank.
3) The total width of the river is 42 feet.
4) To calculate the number of boats that can fit, we need to find how much space is available for the boats.
5) The total available space is 42 feet.
6) Each boat takes up 3 feet, and there needs to be 2 feet between each boat or the riverbank.
7) So the space taken up by each boat and the space between them is 3 feet + 2 feet = 5 feet.
8) To find the number of boats, we divide the total available space (42 feet) by the space taken up by each boat and the space between them (5 feet).
9) 42 feet / 5 feet per boat = 8.4 boats.
10) Since we can't have a fractional number of boats, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 8 boats.
