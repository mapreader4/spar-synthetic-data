Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Will's breakfast supplied him 900 calories of energy.
* He then decided to jog for half an hour (30 minutes).
* Jogging uses up 10 calories of energy per minute.
* To calculate the total calories used up during the 30-minute jog, we multiply the number of minutes (30) by the number of calories used per minute (10):
* 30 minutes x 10 calories/minute = 300 calories used up during the jog.
* To calculate Will's net calorie intake after jogging, we take the initial 900 calories from breakfast and subtract the 300 calories used up during the jog:
* 900 calories - 300 calories = 600 calories.

Answer: 600 calories.
