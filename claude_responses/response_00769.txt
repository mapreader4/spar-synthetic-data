Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recommended time for the french fries to be fully cooked is 5 minutes.
* Bill put the french fries in the oven for 45 seconds.
* To find the remaining time, we need to subtract the time Bill put the fries in the oven (45 seconds) from the recommended time (5 minutes).
* 5 minutes is equal to 300 seconds.
* 300 seconds - 45 seconds = 255 seconds.

Answer: 255 seconds
