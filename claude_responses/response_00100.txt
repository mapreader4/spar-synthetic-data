Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The craft store made a total of 36 sales today
* One-third of the sales were in the fabric section
* To calculate the number of sales in the fabric section, we take one-third of the total sales:
* 1/3 of 36 = 12 sales in the fabric section
* One-quarter of the sales were in the jewelry section
* To calculate the number of sales in the jewelry section, we take one-quarter of the total sales:
* 1/4 of 36 = 9 sales in the jewelry section
* The remaining sales must have been in the stationery section
* To calculate the number of sales in the stationery section, we take the total sales and subtract the sales in the fabric and jewelry sections:
* 36 - 12 - 9 = 15 sales in the stationery section
