Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Moe eats 40 pieces of cuttlebone in 10 seconds
* To find how long it would take Moe to eat 800 pieces, we can set up a proportion:
* 40 pieces / 10 seconds = 800 pieces / x seconds
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 40x = 800 * 10
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = 800 * 10 / 40
* x = 200 seconds

Answer: 200 seconds
