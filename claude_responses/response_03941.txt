Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The skateboard ramp is 50 feet high.
2) Timmy needs to go 40 mph at the start to make it all the way to the top.
3) Timmy's speeds on three trial runs were 36 mph, 34 mph, and 38 mph.
4) To find Timmy's average speed, we add the three speeds and divide by 3:
(36 + 34 + 38) / 3 = 108 / 3 = 36 mph
5) The difference between Timmy's required speed of 40 mph and his average speed of 36 mph is:
40 mph - 36 mph = 4 mph
Therefore, Timmy needs to go 4 mph faster than his average speed to make it up the ramp.
