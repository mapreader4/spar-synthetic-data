Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason.
2) If Haley has 25 necklaces, then Jason must have 20 necklaces (25 - 5 = 20).
3) Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason.
4) Since Jason has 20 necklaces, Josh has 10 necklaces (20 / 2 = 10).
5) Haley has 25 necklaces, and Josh has 10 necklaces.
6) Therefore, Haley has 15 more necklaces than Josh (25 - 10 = 15).

Answer: 15
