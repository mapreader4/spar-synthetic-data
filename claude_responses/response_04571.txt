Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Granger has five times as many spots as his brother, Cisco.
2) Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as his cousin, Rover.
3) Rover has 46 spots.

First, let's find out how many spots Cisco has:
* Rover has 46 spots
* Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as Rover
* So, Cisco has (46/2) - 5 = 18 spots

Now, let's find out how many spots Granger has:
* Granger has five times as many spots as Cisco
* Cisco has 18 spots
* So, Granger has 5 * 18 = 90 spots

Finally, to find the total number of spots that Granger and Cisco have combined:
* Granger has 90 spots
* Cisco has 18 spots
* The total number of spots is 90 + 18 = 108

Answer: 108
