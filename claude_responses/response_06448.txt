Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 kids and 2 adults going to the circus
* Kid's tickets are on sale for only half of the adult tickets
* The total cost is $50

Let's call the cost of an adult ticket "x" and the cost of a kid's ticket "x/2" (since it's half the cost of an adult ticket).

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the adult tickets and the cost of the kid tickets:
* Total cost = 2 * x + 6 * (x/2) = 2x + 3x = 5x

We know the total cost is $50, so:
* 5x = 50
* x = 10

Therefore, the cost of an adult ticket is $10.

Since the kid's ticket is half the cost of the adult ticket, the cost of a kid's ticket is:
* x/2 = 10/2 = $5

Answer: $5
