Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Danny starts with 3 bottles of soda.
2) He drinks 90% of one bottle. That means he drinks 0.9 of a bottle.
3) He gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends. That means he gives away 0.7 of each of the other two bottles, which is 1.4 bottles total.
4) So the total amount of soda Danny has left is 3 - 0.9 - 1.4 = 0.7 bottles.
5) To express this as a percentage of a bottle, we divide 0.7 by 1 (a full bottle) and multiply by 100:
0.7 / 1 * 100 = 70%

Answer: 70%
