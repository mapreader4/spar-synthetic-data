Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kem earns $4 per hour
2) Shem makes 2.5 times more money per hour than Kem
3) To calculate Shem's hourly rate, we multiply Kem's hourly rate by 2.5:
   $4 x 2.5 = $10 per hour
4) Shem works an 8-hour workday
5) To calculate Shem's earnings for the 8-hour workday, we multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours worked:
   $10 x 8 = $80

Answer: $80
