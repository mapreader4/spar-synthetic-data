Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Ahmed has 8 orange trees.
2. Ahmed has four times as many apple trees as Hassan.
3. Hassan has one apple tree and two orange trees.

To find the number of trees in Ahmed's orchard, we need to find the number of apple trees he has.
* Since Hassan has one apple tree, and Ahmed has four times as many, Ahmed has 4 x 1 = 4 apple trees.
* So, the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard is 8 orange trees + 4 apple trees = 12 trees.

To find the number of trees in Hassan's orchard, we know he has one apple tree and two orange trees.
* The total number of trees in Hassan's orchard is 1 apple tree + 2 orange trees = 3 trees.

Now, to find the difference between the number of trees in Ahmed's orchard and Hassan's orchard, we subtract:
* 12 trees (Ahmed's orchard) - 3 trees (Hassan's orchard) = 9 more trees in Ahmed's orchard.
