Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John visits three different countries
* He stays in the first country for 2 weeks
* He spends twice as long in each of the other two countries

To calculate the total time spent on the trip, we need to add up the time spent in each country:
* Time spent in the first country: 2 weeks
* Time spent in the second country: 2 x 2 weeks = 4 weeks
* Time spent in the third country: 2 x 2 weeks = 4 weeks

Now, we add up the time spent in all three countries:
* Total time spent on the trip = 2 weeks + 4 weeks + 4 weeks = 10 weeks

Answer: 10
