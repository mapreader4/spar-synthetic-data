Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jerry can run from his house to his school and back in the time it takes his brother Carson to run to the school.
2) It takes Jerry 15 minutes to make a one-way trip from his house to his school.
3) The school is 4 miles away.
4) Since Jerry can run to the school and back in the same time it takes Carson to run to the school, we can infer that Jerry's round-trip time is twice the time it takes Carson to run to the school.
5) Jerry's round-trip time is 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
6) Therefore, the time it takes Carson to run to the school is 30 minutes.
7) The distance from Jerry's house to the school is 4 miles.
8) Carson's speed in miles per hour = (4 miles) / (0.5 hours) = 8 miles per hour.

Answer: 8 miles per hour.
