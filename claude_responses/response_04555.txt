Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maddy was given 40 chocolate eggs for Easter
* She eats 2 chocolate eggs each day after school
* We need to find out how many weeks the chocolate eggs will last

To calculate this, we need to find out how many days the 40 chocolate eggs will last.

* Maddy eats 2 chocolate eggs per day
* So, 40 chocolate eggs / 2 chocolate eggs per day = 20 days

Now, we can convert the number of days into weeks:
* 20 days / 7 days per week = 2.86 weeks

Since we can't have a fractional number of weeks, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 2 weeks
