Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Honey earned $80 per day
* She worked for 20 days
* So, her total earnings for the 20 days were:
  * $80 per day x 20 days = $1600
* She spent $1360 over the 20 days
* To find how much she saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from her total earnings:
  * $1600 - $1360 = $240

Answer: $240
