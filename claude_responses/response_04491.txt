Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack sews 3 shirts for each of his 3 kids
* So, the total number of shirts he sews is 3 x 3 = 9 shirts
* Each shirt has 7 buttons
* To find the total number of buttons, we multiply the number of shirts (9) by the number of buttons per shirt (7)
* 9 shirts x 7 buttons per shirt = 63 buttons

Answer: 63
