Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The jet travels 580 miles in 2 hours.
2) To find the rate of the jet, we divide the distance by the time: 580 miles / 2 hours = 290 miles per hour.
3) Now, we want to find the distance the jet could travel in 10 hours.
4) To do this, we multiply the rate (290 miles per hour) by the time (10 hours): 290 miles per hour * 10 hours = 2,900 miles.

Answer: 2,900
