Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Trevor spends $20 more than his friend Reed on toys
* Reed spends 2 times as much money as their friend Quinn on the toys
* Trevor spends $80 every year to buy his toys

First, let's find out how much Reed spends on toys:
* Trevor spends $80, and he spends $20 more than Reed
* So, Reed spends $80 - $20 = $60 on toys

Now, let's find out how much Quinn spends on toys:
* Reed spends 2 times as much money as Quinn on the toys
* So, Quinn spends $60 / 2 = $30 on toys

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by the three friends in 4 years:
* Trevor spends $80 per year, so in 4 years he spends $80 x 4 = $320
* Reed spends $60 per year, so in 4 years he spends $60 x 4 = $240
* Quinn spends $30 per year, so in 4 years he spends $30 x 4 = $120

The total amount spent by the three friends in 4 years is:
* $320 + $240 + $120 = $680

Answer: 680
