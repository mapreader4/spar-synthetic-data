Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 2 students are in the restroom
* One less than three times that number of students are absent
* To find the number of students absent:
    - 3 times the number of students in the restroom is 3 * 2 = 6
    - One less than that is 6 - 1 = 5 students absent
* There are four rows with six desks each, and the desks are 2/3 full
* To find the number of students in the classroom:
    - There are 4 rows with 6 desks each, so 4 * 6 = 24 desks total
    - The desks are 2/3 full, so 2/3 * 24 = 16 students in the classroom

Now, to find the total number of students Carla teaches, we add the students in the restroom (2) and the students absent (5) to the students in the classroom (16):
2 + 5 + 16 = 23

Answer: 23
