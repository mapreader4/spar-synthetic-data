Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations
* So the total rotations for Toby's baseballs is:
  - 5 baseballs x 80 rotations per baseball = 400 rotations
* Toby's friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations
* So the total rotations for the friend's apples is:
  - 4 apples x 101 rotations per apple = 404 rotations
* The winner is the one with the most total rotations
* Since Toby's friend has 404 rotations and Toby has 400 rotations, the winner is Toby's friend.

Answer: 404
