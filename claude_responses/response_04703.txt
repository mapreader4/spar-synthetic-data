Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Suzanna's history textbook has 160 pages.
2. Her geography textbook has 70 more pages than the history textbook, so it has 160 + 70 = 230 pages.
3. Her math textbook has half of the sum of the pages in the history and geography textbooks. The sum of the pages in the history and geography textbooks is 160 + 230 = 390. Half of 390 is 195, so the math textbook has 195 pages.
4. Her science textbook has twice the number of pages of her history textbook, which is 2 * 160 = 320 pages.

Now, to find the total number of pages in all her textbooks, we add up the pages in each textbook:
160 + 230 + 195 + 320 = 905

Answer: 905
