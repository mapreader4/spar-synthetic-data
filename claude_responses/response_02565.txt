Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John climbs up 9 flights of stairs
* Each flight is 10 feet
* Each step is 18 inches

To calculate the total number of steps, we need to first find the total height of the stairs:
* 9 flights x 10 feet per flight = 90 feet

Now, we need to convert the total height from feet to inches:
* 90 feet x 12 inches per foot = 1080 inches

Finally, we divide the total height in inches by the height of each step (18 inches) to get the total number of steps:
* 1080 inches / 18 inches per step = 60 steps

Answer: 60
