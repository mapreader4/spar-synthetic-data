Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The silverware costs $20.
2) The dinner plates cost 50% as much as the silverware.
3) To find the cost of the dinner plates, we take 50% of the silverware cost:
   * 50% of $20 = 0.5 * $20 = $10
4) So the dinner plates cost $10.
5) To find the total cost, we add the cost of the silverware and the dinner plates:
   * Total cost = $20 + $10 = $30

Answer: $30
