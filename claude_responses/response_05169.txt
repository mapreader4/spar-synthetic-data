Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The amusement park sells tickets for $3 each
* On Monday through Friday, the park welcomed 100 people per day
* On Saturday, the park welcomed 200 people
* On Sunday, the park welcomed 300 people
* To calculate the total money made in a week, we need to:
  1. Calculate the money made from Monday through Friday
  2. Calculate the money made on Saturday
  3. Calculate the money made on Sunday
  4. Add up the totals from the previous 3 steps

Step 1: Calculate the money made from Monday through Friday
* 100 people per day x $3 per ticket = $300 per day
* 5 days (Monday through Friday) x $300 per day = $1,500

Step 2: Calculate the money made on Saturday
* 200 people x $3 per ticket = $600

Step 3: Calculate the money made on Sunday
* 300 people x $3 per ticket = $900

Step 4: Add up the totals from the previous 3 steps
* $1,500 + $600 + $900 = $3,000

Answer: $3,000
