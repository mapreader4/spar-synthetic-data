Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aaron pays $80 for his actuary membership fee in the first year.
* The membership fee increases by $10 each year.
* We want to find the membership cost in the sixth year.

To calculate the membership cost in the sixth year, we need to find the yearly increase and add it to the initial cost.

* Year 1: $80
* Year 2: $80 + $10 = $90
* Year 3: $90 + $10 = $100
* Year 4: $100 + $10 = $110
* Year 5: $110 + $10 = $120
* Year 6: $120 + $10 = $130

Answer: $130
