Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tommy saw 12 trucks
* Each truck has 4 wheels
* So for the 12 trucks, the total number of wheels is 12 * 4 = 48 wheels
* Tommy also saw 13 cars
* Each car has 4 wheels
* So for the 13 cars, the total number of wheels is 13 * 4 = 52 wheels
* To find the total number of wheels Tommy saw, we add the wheels from the trucks and the cars:
* 48 wheels (from the trucks) + 52 wheels (from the cars) = 100 wheels

Answer: 100
