Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kwame studied for 2.5 hours
* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* So Kwame studied for 2.5 x 60 = 150 minutes
* Connor studied for 1.5 hours
* 1.5 x 60 = 90 minutes
* Lexia studied for 97 minutes
* The total time Kwame and Connor studied is 150 + 90 = 240 minutes
* The time Lexia studied is 97 minutes
* The difference between the time Kwame and Connor studied and the time Lexia studied is 240 - 97 = 143 minutes

Answer: 143
