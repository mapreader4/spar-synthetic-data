Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jemma sells the glass frames at $5 each.
2) Jemma sells twice as many frames as Dorothy.
3) Jemma sold 400 frames.
4) Since Jemma sells twice as many frames as Dorothy, Dorothy must have sold 200 frames (400 / 2).
5) Dorothy sells the frames at half the price that Jemma sells them, so Dorothy sells them for $2.50 each (5 / 2).
6) To calculate the total amount made, we need to find the revenue for both Jemma and Dorothy.
7) Jemma's revenue: 400 frames x $5 per frame = $2,000.
8) Dorothy's revenue: 200 frames x $2.50 per frame = $500.
9) The total amount made together is the sum of Jemma's and Dorothy's revenue.
Answer: $2,500.
