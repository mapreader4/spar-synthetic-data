Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Miles is going to spend 1/6 of a day reading.
2) He will read comic books, graphic novels, and novels.
3) He reads 21 pages an hour when he reads novels.
4) He reads 30 pages an hour when he reads graphic novels.
5) He reads 45 pages an hour when he reads comic books.
6) He will read each for 1/3 of his time.

To calculate the total number of pages he reads:
* 1/6 of a day is 4 hours (1 day = 24 hours, 1/6 of 24 = 4)
* He will spend 4 hours reading in total
* He will spend 4 * 1/3 = 4/3 hours reading novels
* He will spend 4 * 1/3 = 4/3 hours reading graphic novels
* He will spend 4 * 1/3 = 4/3 hours reading comic books

Now we can calculate the number of pages read for each:
* Novels: 21 pages/hour * 4/3 hours = 28 pages
* Graphic Novels: 30 pages/hour * 4/3 hours = 40 pages
* Comic Books: 45 pages/hour * 4/3 hours = 60 pages

The total number of pages read is:
28 + 40 + 60 = 128 pages

Answer: 128
