Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.
2) This means the total number of squares in the quilt is 16 + 16 = 32 squares.
3) Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.
4) 25% of 32 squares is 0.25 * 32 = 8 squares.
5) So Betsy has already sewn 8 squares together.
6) To find how many more squares she needs to sew, we take the total number of squares (32) and subtract the number of squares she has already sewn (8).
7) 32 - 8 = 24 squares.

Answer: 24
