Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Esperanza pays $600 in rent.
2. She spends 3/5 as much on food as she pays on rent. 
   * 3/5 of $600 = $360 on food.
3. Her mortgage bill costs three times the amount of money she spends on food.
   * 3 x $360 = $1080 on mortgage.
4. She saves $2000 per month.
5. She pays the equivalent of 2/5 of her savings in taxes.
   * 2/5 of $2000 = $800 in taxes.

Now, to calculate her gross monthly salary, we need to add up all her expenses and savings:
* Rent: $600
* Food: $360
* Mortgage: $1080
* Savings: $2000
* Taxes: $800

Total expenses and savings: $600 + $360 + $1080 + $2000 + $800 = $4840

Therefore, her gross monthly salary is:
Answer: $4840
