Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maria needs to buy a set of brushes for $20.
2) She also needs to buy some canvas, which costs three times more than the brushes. So, the canvas will cost $20 x 3 = $60.
3) Maria needs at least 5 liters of paint, and each liter costs $8. So, the total cost of the paint will be $8 x 5 = $40.
4) The total cost of the materials Maria needs to buy is $20 (brushes) + $60 (canvas) + $40 (paint) = $120.
5) Maria will be able to sell the painting for $200.
6) The profit Maria will make on the painting is $200 - $120 = $80.

Answer: $80
