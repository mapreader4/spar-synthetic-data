Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nicole started with 10 pieces of clothing.
2) Her first older sister had half as many clothes as Nicole, which means she had 5 pieces of clothing.
3) The next oldest sister had 2 more pieces of clothing than Nicole, which means she had 12 pieces of clothing.
4) The oldest sister had the average of what her three younger sisters had. To calculate the average, we add up the pieces of clothing for the three younger sisters (10 + 5 + 12 = 27) and divide by 3, which gives us 9. So the oldest sister had 9 pieces of clothing.
5) Now we add up all the pieces of clothing that Nicole received from her three older sisters (5 + 12 + 9 = 26) and add that to the 10 pieces of clothing she started with.
