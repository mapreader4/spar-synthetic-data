Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, the shelter has:
  - 30 dogs
  - 28 cats
  - 20 lizards
* Every month:
  - 50% of the dogs are adopted, which means 15 dogs are adopted (0.5 * 30 = 15)
  - 25% of the cats are adopted, which means 7 cats are adopted (0.25 * 28 = 7)
  - 20% of the lizards are adopted, which means 4 lizards are adopted (0.2 * 20 = 4)
* The shelter takes in 13 new pets a month
* To calculate the total number of pets after one month:
  - Dogs: 30 - 15 + 13 = 28
  - Cats: 28 - 7 + 13 = 34
  - Lizards: 20 - 4 + 13 = 29
* Adding up the total number of pets:
  - 28 + 34 + 29 = 91

Answer: 91
