Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martha is buying 4 jackets.
2) For every 2 jackets she buys, she gets 1 free jacket.
3) So, for the 4 jackets she's buying, she will get 2 free jackets.
4) That means the total number of jackets she will take home is 4 + 2 = 6 jackets.
5) Martha is also buying 9 t-shirts.
6) For every 3 t-shirts she buys, she gets 1 free t-shirt.
7) So, for the 9 t-shirts she's buying, she will get 3 free t-shirts.
8) That means the total number of t-shirts she will take home is 9 + 3 = 12 t-shirts.
9) Adding the jackets and t-shirts together, the total number of clothes she will take home is 6 + 12 = 18 clothes.
