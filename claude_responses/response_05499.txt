Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Grayson's motorboat:
* Grayson drives for 1 hour at 25 mph, so he travels 25 miles in the first hour.
* Grayson then drives for 0.5 hours at 20 mph, so he travels 10 miles in the second half-hour.
* In total, Grayson travels 25 + 10 = 35 miles in his motorboat.

Rudy's rowboat:
* Rudy rows for 3 hours at 10 mph, so he travels 30 miles in his rowboat.

To find the difference in distance traveled:
* Grayson's distance - Rudy's distance = 35 miles - 30 miles = 5 miles

Answer: 5 miles
