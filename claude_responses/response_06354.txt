Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nick is 13 years old
* His sister is 6 years older than him, so she is 13 + 6 = 19 years old
* Their combined age is 13 + 19 = 32 years
* Their brother is half their combined age, so he is 32 / 2 = 16 years old
* In 5 years, Nick will be 13 + 5 = 18 years old
* In 5 years, his sister will be 19 + 5 = 24 years old
* Their combined age in 5 years will be 18 + 24 = 42 years
* Their brother will still be half their combined age, so he will be 42 / 2 = 21 years old
