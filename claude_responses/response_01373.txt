Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jose bought 20,000 square meters of land
* He needs to divide this land equally with his four siblings
* To find the amount of land Jose will have after dividing it, we need to divide the total land area by the number of people (Jose and his four siblings)
* 20,000 square meters / 5 people = 4,000 square meters per person
* Therefore, Jose will have 4,000 square meters of land after dividing it with his siblings.

Answer: 4,000
