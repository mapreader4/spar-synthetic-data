Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 65 dolphins in the ocean initially
* Three times that number (3 x 65 = 195) joins in from a river
* To calculate the total number of dolphins in the ocean, we add the initial 65 dolphins to the 195 dolphins that joined in from the river:
* 65 + 195 = 260

Answer: 260
