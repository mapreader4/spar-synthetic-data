Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The animal shelter received 60 animals in total
* They got 20 more cats than dogs
* Let's represent the number of dogs as x
* Then, the number of cats is x + 20
* The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 20) = 60
* Solving for x, we get:
2x + 20 = 60
2x = 40
x = 20
* Therefore, the number of dogs is 20
* The number of cats is 20 + 20 = 40

Answer: 40
