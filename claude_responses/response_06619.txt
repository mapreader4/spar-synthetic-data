Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The rancher has 400 head of cattle to transport
* The animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle
* The distance to travel is 60 miles
* The truck travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour

To calculate the total driving time, we need to determine how many trips the truck will need to make to transport all 400 head of cattle.

* The truck can hold 20 head of cattle per trip
* 400 head of cattle / 20 head per trip = 20 trips

Now, we can calculate the total driving time:
* Each trip is 60 miles
* At 60 miles per hour, each trip will take 1 hour
* 20 trips x 1 hour per trip = 20 hours

Therefore, the total driving time to transport all 400 head of cattle to higher ground is 20 hours.

Answer: 20
