Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The range of the scores is 75. This means the difference between the highest and lowest score is 75.
2) The highest score is 98. So the lowest score must be 98 - 75 = 23.
3) Mark scored twice as much as the least score, which is 23. So Mark's score must be 2 * 23 = 46.

Answer: 46
