Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 1.5 ounces of silver.
2) He also buys twice as much gold, which means he buys 3 ounces of gold.
3) The silver costs $20 per ounce.
4) The gold is 50 times more expensive per ounce, so the gold costs $1,000 per ounce.
5) To calculate the total cost:
   - Silver cost: 1.5 ounces x $20 per ounce = $30
   - Gold cost: 3 ounces x $1,000 per ounce = $3,000
6) The total amount John spends is the sum of the silver and gold costs:
   - Total cost = $30 + $3,000 = $3,030

Answer: 3030
