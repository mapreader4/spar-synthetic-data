Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The assignment was divided into three parts
* Leo finished the first part in 25 minutes
* It took him twice as long to finish the second part, so 2 x 25 = 50 minutes
* The total time to finish the assignment was 2 hours, which is 120 minutes
* We need to find the time it took to finish the third part

To find the time for the third part, we need to subtract the time for the first two parts from the total time:
* Total time = 120 minutes
* Time for first part = 25 minutes
* Time for second part = 50 minutes
* Time for third part = 120 minutes - 25 minutes - 50 minutes = 45 minutes

Answer: 45 minutes
