Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Toby and his friend each order a cheeseburger for $3.65 each, so that's $3.65 x 2 = $7.30 for the cheeseburgers.
2. Toby gets a milkshake for $2, and his friend gets a coke for $1, so that's $2 + $1 = $3 for the drinks.
3. They split a large fries that cost $4, so that's $4 / 2 = $2 for each person.
4. His friend also gets three cookies that cost $0.50 each, so that's $0.50 x 3 = $1.50 for the cookies.
5. The total cost of the meal is $7.30 + $3 + $2 + $1.50 = $13.80.
6. The tax is $0.20, so the total bill is $13.80 + $0.20 = $14.00.
7. Since they are splitting the bill, Toby's share is $14.00 / 2 = $7.00.
8. Toby arrived with $15, so the change he is bringing home is $15 - $7.00 = $8.00.

Answer: $8
