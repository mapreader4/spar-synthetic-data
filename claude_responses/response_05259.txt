Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You caught 4 fewer fish than the number in your tank
* You added those fish to your tank
* The tank now has 20 fish

Let's call the original number of fish in the tank as 'x'.
* You caught 'x - 4' fish
* You added those fish to the tank
* The tank now has 20 fish

So, the original number of fish in the tank plus the number of fish you added is 20:
* x + (x - 4) = 20

Solving for x:
* 2x - 4 = 20
* 2x = 24
* x = 12

Therefore, the number of fish you added to the tank is 'x - 4' = 12 - 4 = 8.
