Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each round consists of 5 questions
* James missed 1 question, so he answered 4 questions correctly in each round
* For each correct answer, the student earns 2 points
* So, for each round, James earned 4 x 2 = 8 points
* Since there were 5 rounds, James earned 8 x 5 = 40 points
* Additionally, since James answered all the questions correctly in one round, he earned a 4 point bonus
* Therefore, the total points James earned is 40 + 4 = 44 points

Answer: 44
