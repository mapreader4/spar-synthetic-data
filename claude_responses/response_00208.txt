Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John puts $25 in his piggy bank every month for 2 years.
2) There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years he will have put in 2 x 12 = 24 months' worth of savings.
3) The total amount he saved in 2 years is 24 x $25 = $600.
4) He had to spend $400 from his piggy bank savings last week to repair his car.
5) The amount left in his piggy bank is the original $600 minus the $400 he spent, which is $600 - $400 = $200.

Answer: $200
