Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeff committed to run for an hour (60 minutes) a day during weekdays
* There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday through Friday)
* So the total time he committed to run in a week is:
    - 5 days x 60 minutes per day = 300 minutes
* On Thursday, he cut his run short by 20 minutes
    - So on Thursday, he ran for 60 minutes - 20 minutes = 40 minutes
* On Friday, he was able to jog 10 minutes more
    - So on Friday, he ran for 60 minutes + 10 minutes = 70 minutes
* To calculate the total minutes he was able to run for the week:
    - Monday through Wednesday: 3 days x 60 minutes = 180 minutes
    - Thursday: 40 minutes
    - Friday: 70 minutes
    - Total minutes: 180 + 40 + 70 = 290 minutes

Answer: 290 minutes
