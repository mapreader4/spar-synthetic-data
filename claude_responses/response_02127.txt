Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) Store A:
   - Full price of the smartphone: $125
   - Discount offered: 8%
   - Discounted price = $125 - (8% of $125) = $125 - $10 = $115

2) Store B:
   - Full price of the smartphone: $130
   - Discount offered: 10%
   - Discounted price = $130 - (10% of $130) = $130 - $13 = $117

3) To find the difference in price between the two stores:
   - Store A's price: $115
   - Store B's price: $117
   - Difference = $117 - $115 = $2

Answer: $2
