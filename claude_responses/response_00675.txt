Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For the first lawsuit:
* Chance of winning: 30%
* Payout if won: $5,000,000
* Payout if lost: $0

For the second lawsuit:
* Chance of winning: 50%
* Payout if won: $2,000,000
* Payout if lost: $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate the probability of winning both lawsuits:
* Probability of winning both lawsuits = 0.3 x 0.5 = 0.15 or 15%

Next, let's calculate the probability of losing both lawsuits:
* Probability of losing the first lawsuit = 0.7
* Probability of losing the second lawsuit = 0.5
* Probability of losing both lawsuits = 0.7 x 0.5 = 0.35 or 35%

To find the percentage difference between the probability of losing both lawsuits and winning both lawsuits, we can use the formula:
* Percentage difference = (Probability of losing both - Probability of winning both) / Probability of winning both * 100
* Percentage difference = (0.35 - 0.15) / 0.15 * 100 = 133.33%

Answer: 133.33%
