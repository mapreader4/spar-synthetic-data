Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Scott sold 40 cups of smoothies at $3 per cup.
   * 40 cups x $3 per cup = $120 from smoothies
2) Scott sold 18 cakes at $2 each.
   * 18 cakes x $2 per cake = $36 from cakes
3) To calculate the total amount of money Scott made, we add the money from the smoothies and the cakes:
   * $120 (from smoothies) + $36 (from cakes) = $156

Answer: 156
