Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Patrick bought a season pass for each of his two sons, at a cost of $100.00 per pass.
2) The oldest son went to the park 35 times over the summer.
3) The youngest son went to the park 15 times over the summer.
4) To calculate the cost per trip, we need to find the total cost of the passes and divide it by the total number of trips.
5) The total cost of the passes is 2 * $100.00 = $200.00.
6) The total number of trips is 35 + 15 = 50.
7) The cost per trip is $200.00 / 50 = $4.00.
