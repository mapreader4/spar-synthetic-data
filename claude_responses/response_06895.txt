Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John danced for 3 hours, then took a 1-hour break, and then danced for another 5 hours.
   * So, John's total dancing time was 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

2. James danced the whole time John was dancing and resting, which was 8 hours + 1 hour = 9 hours.
   * Then, James danced for another 1/3 of 9 hours, which is 3 hours.
   * So, James' total dancing time was 9 hours + 3 hours = 12 hours.

3. To find the combined dancing time without including John's break time, we add John's dancing time (8 hours) and James' dancing time (12 hours):
   * 8 hours + 12 hours = 20 hours.

Answer: 20 hours.
