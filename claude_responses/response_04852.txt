Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The newspaper subscription costs $10 per month
* If you purchase an annual subscription, you get a 20% discount on the total bill
* To calculate the total cost of the annual subscription without the discount:
  * 12 months in a year
  * $10 per month
  * 12 months x $10 per month = $120 total
* Now, with the 20% discount:
  * 20% of $120 = 0.20 x $120 = $24
  * $120 - $24 = $96

Therefore, the amount you end up paying for the annual newspaper subscription with the 20% discount is:

Answer: $96
