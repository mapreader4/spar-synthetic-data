Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic
* The remaining 60% of the students are divided into two equal groups
* Only one of the two equal groups is physically in school on any day

So, we can calculate the percentage of students present in school as follows:
* 60% of the students are divided into two equal groups
* That means each group represents 30% of the total students
* Only one of those groups is physically in school on any day
* Therefore, the percentage of students present in school is 30%

Answer: 30
