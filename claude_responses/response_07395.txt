Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Matilda has half as many jellybeans as Matt.
2) Matt has ten times as many jellybeans as Steve.
3) Steve has 84 jellybeans.
4) First, we can calculate how many jellybeans Matt has. Since Matt has ten times as many jellybeans as Steve, and Steve has 84 jellybeans, then Matt has 10 * 84 = 840 jellybeans.
5) Since Matilda has half as many jellybeans as Matt, and Matt has 840 jellybeans, then Matilda has 840 / 2 = 420 jellybeans.

Answer: 420
