Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 25 students in Bryce's class
* 10 kids want chocolate doughnuts
* 15 kids want glazed doughnuts
* Chocolate doughnuts cost $2 each
* Glazed doughnuts cost $1 each

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of the chocolate doughnuts and the cost of the glazed doughnuts, then add them together.

Cost of chocolate doughnuts:
* 10 kids want chocolate doughnuts
* Each chocolate doughnut costs $2
* So the total cost of chocolate doughnuts is 10 x $2 = $20

Cost of glazed doughnuts:
* 15 kids want glazed doughnuts
* Each glazed doughnut costs $1
* So the total cost of glazed doughnuts is 15 x $1 = $15

Total cost of all doughnuts:
* Total cost = Cost of chocolate doughnuts + Cost of glazed doughnuts
* Total cost = $20 + $15 = $35

Answer: $35
