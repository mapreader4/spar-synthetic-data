Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Zach rented a car for $150.
2) He drove 620 miles on Monday.
3) He drove 744 miles on Thursday.
4) The car rental cost is $150 plus 50 cents for each mile driven.
5) For the 620 miles driven on Monday, the additional cost is 620 * $0.50 = $310.
6) For the 744 miles driven on Thursday, the additional cost is 744 * $0.50 = $372.
7) The total cost is the rental fee ($150) plus the additional mileage costs ($310 + $372) = $150 + $682 = $832.

Answer: $832
