Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adam had 12 cows on his farm.
2) He had twice as many sheep as cows, so he had 2 x 12 = 24 sheep.
3) He decided to buy 3 pigs for every sheep he had, so he bought 3 x 24 = 72 pigs.
4) To find the total number of animals on the farm after the transaction, we add up the cows, sheep, and pigs:
12 cows + 24 sheep + 72 pigs = 108 animals.

Answer: 108
