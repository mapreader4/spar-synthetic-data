Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 88 dogs in the park
* 12 of the dogs are running
* Half of the 12 running dogs are playing with toys
* 1/4 of the 12 running dogs are barking

First, let's find out how many dogs are playing with toys:
* Half of 12 running dogs = 12 / 2 = 6 dogs are playing with toys

Next, let's find out how many dogs are barking:
* 1/4 of 12 running dogs = 12 / 4 = 3 dogs are barking

Now, we can find out how many dogs are not doing anything:
* Total dogs (88) - running dogs (12) - playing dogs (6) - barking dogs (3) = 88 - 12 - 6 - 3 = 67 dogs are not doing anything

Answer: 67
