Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Chris bought 8 movies on DVD for $12 each.
2) The total cost of the DVD movies is 8 * $12 = $96.
3) Chris also bought 4 movies on Blu-ray for $18 each.
4) The total cost of the Blu-ray movies is 4 * $18 = $72.
5) The total cost of all the movies is $96 + $72 = $168.
6) The total number of movies bought is 8 + 4 = 12.
7) The average price per movie is the total cost divided by the total number of movies: $168 / 12 = $14.
