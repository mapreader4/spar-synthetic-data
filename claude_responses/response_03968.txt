Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs
* After dropping the basket, she had 5 brown eggs left
* She had a dozen (12) eggs left in total

First, let's figure out how many brown eggs she had originally:
* She had 5 brown eggs left after the drop
* This means she originally had more than 5 brown eggs

Next, let's figure out how many white eggs she had originally:
* She had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs
* If she had more than 5 brown eggs, then she had more than 15 white eggs (3 x 5)
* She had a dozen (12) eggs left in total, so she must have had more than 12 eggs originally

Finally, we can calculate the number of eggs she broke:
* She had more than 17 eggs originally (5 brown + 15 white)
* She had 12 eggs left after the drop
* Therefore, she must have broken more than 5 eggs
