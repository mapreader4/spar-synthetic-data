Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Karen ordered a 5-dollar burger
* Her son then ordered a 4-dollar sandwich
* Karen then ordered two 4-dollar smoothies

To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the individual items:
* 5-dollar burger + 4-dollar sandwich + (2 x 4-dollar smoothies)
* = 5 + 4 + (2 x 4)
* = 5 + 4 + 8
* = 17

Answer: 17
