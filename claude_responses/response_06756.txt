Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John gave his fiancee a $4000 ring on their engagement day.
2) On their wedding day, John gave his fiancee a $2000 car as a gift.
3) John also gave his fiancee a diamond brace that was twice as expensive as the ring he gave her during the engagement.
4) To calculate the cost of the diamond brace, we take the cost of the engagement ring ($4000) and multiply it by 2, which gives us $8000.
5) To calculate the total worth of the presents John gave to his fiancee, we add up the cost of the engagement ring ($4000), the cost of the car ($2000), and the cost of the diamond brace ($8000).

Answer: $14,000
