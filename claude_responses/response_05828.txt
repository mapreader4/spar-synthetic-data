Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We have 4 children: June, Patty, Josh, and Henry.
2) Their math test scores are: June - 97, Patty - 85, Josh - 100, and Henry - 94.
3) To find the average of their scores, we need to add up the scores and divide by the number of children.
4) The sum of the scores is: 97 + 85 + 100 + 94 = 376.
5) Dividing the sum by the number of children (4), we get: 376 / 4 = 94.

Answer: 94
