Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Billie bakes 3 pumpkin pies every day for 11 days
* So, the total number of pies Billie bakes is 3 pies x 11 days = 33 pies
* It takes 2 cans of whipped cream to cover 1 pie
* Tiffany eats 4 pies
* So, the number of pies remaining is 33 pies - 4 pies = 29 pies
* To cover the remaining 29 pies, Billie needs 29 pies x 2 cans per pie = 58 cans of whipped cream

Answer: 58
