Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Angela needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals
* She needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined
* Let's call the number of meals she needs to deliver 'x'
* Since she needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals, the number of packages she needs to deliver is 8x
* The total number of meals and packages is 27, so we can write the equation:
x + 8x = 27
* Solving for x, we get:
9x = 27
x = 3
Therefore, the number of meals Angela needs to deliver is 3.
