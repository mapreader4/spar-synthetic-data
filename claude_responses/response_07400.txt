Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Hana sold 4/7 of her stamp collection for $28.
2) This means that 4/7 of the total value of the stamp collection is $28.
3) To find the total value of the stamp collection, we need to find the value of the entire collection.
4) We can do this by setting up a proportion:
4/7 = $28 / x
5) Cross-multiplying, we get:
4x = 28 * 7
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = 28 * 7 / 4
7) Simplifying, we get:
x = $49
Answer: $49
