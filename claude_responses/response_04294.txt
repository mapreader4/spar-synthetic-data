Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah saves $5.00 a week for the first 4 weeks
* So, for the first 4 weeks, she saves:
  * 4 weeks x $5.00 per week = $20.00
* Then, she saves $10.00 a week for the next 4 weeks
* So, for the next 4 weeks, she saves:
  * 4 weeks x $10.00 per week = $40.00
* Finally, she saves $20.00 a week for the last 4 weeks
* So, for the last 4 weeks, she saves:
  * 4 weeks x $20.00 per week = $80.00
* To calculate the total amount she has saved over 12 weeks, we add up the amounts from each of the three periods:
  * $20.00 + $40.00 + $80.00 = $140.00

Answer: 140
