Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The group pays a total of $720 for admission tickets.
2) The price of an adult ticket is $15, and the price of a child ticket is $8.
3) There are 25 more adults than children in the group.
Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the number of children in the group
* Then the number of adults is x + 25
4) The total cost of the tickets is the sum of the cost of the adult tickets and the cost of the child tickets:
* Total cost = (x + 25) * $15 + x * $8
* Total cost = 15x + 375 + 8x
* Total cost = 23x + 375
5) We know the total cost is $720, so we can set up an equation:
* 23x + 375 = 720
* 23x = 345
* x = 15
Therefore, the number of children in the group is 15.

Answer: 15
