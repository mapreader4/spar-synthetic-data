Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jade had $38 to start with.
2) Julia had half as much as Jade, which means she had $19 to start with.
3) Together, Jade and Julia had $38 + $19 = $57 to start with.
4) On New Year's eve, their aunt gave them an equal amount of money, so that they had a total of $97.
5) To find out how much the aunt gave each of them, we need to subtract the original amount they had ($57) from the total amount they had after the aunt's gift ($97).
6) $97 - $57 = $40
7) Since the aunt gave them an equal amount, we divide $40 by 2 to get the amount she gave each of them.
8) $40 / 2 = $20

Answer: $20
