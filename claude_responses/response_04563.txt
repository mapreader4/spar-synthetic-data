Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sharks are fed 4 buckets of fish each day
* Dolphins are fed half as many buckets as the sharks, so 2 buckets each day
* Other sea animals are fed 5 times as many buckets as the sharks, so 20 buckets each day
* In total, the aquarium uses:
    - Sharks: 4 buckets per day
    - Dolphins: 2 buckets per day
    - Other sea animals: 20 buckets per day
    - Total: 4 + 2 + 20 = 26 buckets per day
* There are 546 buckets of fish available
* To find how many weeks this will last, we divide the total number of buckets by the number of buckets used per day:
    - 546 buckets / 26 buckets per day = 21 days
* Since there are 7 days in a week, 21 days is equivalent to 3 weeks.

Answer: 3 weeks
