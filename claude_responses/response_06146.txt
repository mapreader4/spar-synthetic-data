Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The gift for their mother costs $250.
2) Erika saved $155.
3) Rick saved half of the cost of the gift, which is $250 / 2 = $125.
4) The birthday cake costs $25.
5) To calculate the total amount of money they have saved, we add Erika's savings ($155) and Rick's savings ($125):
   $155 + $125 = $280
6) To calculate the amount of money they will have left after buying the gift ($250) and the cake ($25), we subtract the total cost ($250 + $25 = $275) from the total amount of money they have saved ($280):
   $280 - $275 = $5
