Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Linda sold 4 necklaces and 8 rings at the craft fair
* Each necklace costs $12
* The total revenue from the sales was $80

First, let's calculate the revenue from the necklace sales:
* 4 necklaces x $12 per necklace = $48

Now, we can calculate the revenue from the ring sales by subtracting the necklace revenue from the total revenue:
* Total revenue - Necklace revenue = Ring revenue
* $80 - $48 = $32

Finally, we can divide the ring revenue by the number of rings sold to find the cost of each ring:
* Ring revenue / Number of rings sold = Cost per ring
* $32 / 8 rings = $4 per ring

Answer: $4
