Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Braden had $400 in his money box initially.
* He placed a bet with Byan that the Raptors would beat the Bulls.
* If Braden's prediction was correct, he and Byan had agreed that the winner would receive twice as much money as Braden had in his money box.

So, if Braden won the bet:
* Braden would receive twice the amount he had in his money box, which is 2 x $400 = $800.
* This means Braden would have a total of $400 (his initial amount) + $800 (the winnings) = $1,200 in his money box after winning the bet.

Answer: 1,200
