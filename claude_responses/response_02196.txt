Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The cost of the earbuds is $200.
2) The tax rate is 15%.
3) To calculate the total amount John paid, we need to add the tax to the original cost.
4) The tax amount is 15% of $200, which is 0.15 * $200 = $30.
5) The total amount John paid is the original cost ($200) plus the tax ($30).
6) Therefore, the total amount John paid is $200 + $30 = $230.

Answer: 230
