Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The florist has 75 narcissus flowers and 90 chrysanthemums.
2) Each bouquet will contain 5 flowers.
3) To find the total number of flowers, we add the narcissus and chrysanthemums: 75 + 90 = 165 flowers.
4) To find the number of bouquets, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet: 165 / 5 = 33 bouquets.

Answer: 33
