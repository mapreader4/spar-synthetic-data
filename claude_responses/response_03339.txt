Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The number of students has increased by 20% this year
* The number of students this year is 960
* To find the number of students last year, we need to work backwards from the 20% increase

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of students:
* 20% increase means the number of students has increased by 20% of the original number
* 20% of the original number is 0.20 * original number
* So the increase in the number of students is 0.20 * original number

Now, we can use this information to find the original number of students (last year's number):
* Current number of students (this year) = original number + increase
* 960 = original number + 0.20 * original number
* 960 = 1.20 * original number
* Original number = 960 / 1.20
* Original number = 800

Therefore, the number of students last year was 800.

Answer: 800
