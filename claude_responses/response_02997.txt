Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The YouTube video is 100 hours long.
2) Lila watches the video at two times the average speed, which means she watches it in half the time, or 50 hours.
3) Roger watches the video at the average speed, which means he watches it in 100 hours.
4) They both watched six of the same videos.
5) Lila's total watch time is 6 * 50 = 300 hours.
6) Roger's total watch time is 6 * 100 = 600 hours.
7) The total number of hours they watched is 300 + 600 = 900 hours.

Answer: 900
