Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sally reads 10 pages on weekdays
* Sally reads 20 pages on weekends
* It takes 2 weeks for Sally to finish the book

In 1 week, Sally reads:
* 5 weekdays x 10 pages = 50 pages
* 2 weekend days x 20 pages = 40 pages
* Total in 1 week = 50 + 40 = 90 pages

Since it takes 2 weeks for Sally to finish the book, the total number of pages in the book is:
* 90 pages per week x 2 weeks = 180 pages

Answer: 180
