Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alexander bought 22 more joggers than Tyson
2) Christopher bought twenty times as many joggers as Tyson
3) Christopher bought 80 joggers
4) Since Christopher bought 20 times as many joggers as Tyson, we can divide 80 by 20 to find how many joggers Tyson bought:
   * Tyson bought 80 / 20 = 4 joggers
5) Since Alexander bought 22 more joggers than Tyson, we can add 22 to 4 to find how many joggers Alexander bought:
   * Alexander bought 4 + 22 = 26 joggers
6) Now we can find the difference between how many joggers Christopher bought and how many joggers Alexander bought:
   * Christopher bought 80 joggers
   * Alexander bought 26 joggers
   * 80 - 26 = 54 more joggers that Christopher bought than Alexander
