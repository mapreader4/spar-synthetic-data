Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carmen burns a candle for 1 hour every night
* A candle will last her 8 nights
* If she burns the candle for 2 hours a night, how many candles will she use over 24 nights?

First, let's calculate how long one candle will last if she burns it for 2 hours a night:
* 1 candle lasts 8 nights when burned for 1 hour per night
* So, 1 candle will last 8 / 1 = 8 hours when burned for 1 hour per night
* When burned for 2 hours per night, 1 candle will last 8 / 2 = 4 nights

Now, we can calculate how many candles she will use over 24 nights:
* 24 nights / 4 nights per candle = 6 candles
