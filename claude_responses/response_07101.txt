Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Sunday, Alice bought 4 pints of strawberry ice cream.

2. On Monday, she bought three times the number of pints she bought the day before, which is 3 x 4 = 12 pints.

3. On Tuesday, she bought one-third of the number of pints she bought the day before, which is 1/3 x 12 = 4 pints.

4. On Wednesday, she returned half of the pints she bought the day before, which is 1/2 x 4 = 2 pints.

Now, let's add up the total number of pints she had on Wednesday:
* Sunday: 4 pints
* Monday: 12 pints
* Tuesday: 4 pints
* Wednesday: 4 pints - 2 pints = 2 pints

Therefore, the total number of pints of ice cream Alice had on Wednesday is:
4 + 12 + 4 - 2 = 18 pints

Answer: 18
