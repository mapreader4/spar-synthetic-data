Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pam is currently twice as young as Rena
* In 10 years, Rena will be 5 years older than Pam
* Let's call Rena's current age 'x'
* Then Pam's current age is 'x/2'
* In 10 years, Rena's age will be 'x + 10'
* And Pam's age will be 'x/2 + 10'
* We know that in 10 years, Rena will be 5 years older than Pam, so:
* (x + 10) = (x/2 + 10) + 5
* Solving this equation:
* x + 10 = x/2 + 15
* x/2 = 5
* x = 10
* So Rena's current age is 10
* And Pam's current age is 10/2 = 5

Answer: 5
