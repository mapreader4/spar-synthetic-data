Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Boris has 24 books and he donates a fourth of his books to the library.
   * A fourth of 24 books is 24 / 4 = 6 books.
   * So, Boris donates 6 books to the library and keeps 24 - 6 = 18 books.

2. Cameron has 30 books and he donates a third of his books to the library.
   * A third of 30 books is 30 / 3 = 10 books.
   * So, Cameron donates 10 books to the library and keeps 30 - 10 = 20 books.

3. After donating their books, the total number of books Boris and Cameron have together is:
   * Boris has 18 books.
   * Cameron has 20 books.
   * The total number of books they have together is 18 + 20 = 38 books.

Answer: 38
