Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Donna cut her pizza into 12 slices.
2) She ate half of the pizza for lunch, which means she ate 6 slices.
3) That leaves 12 - 6 = 6 slices remaining.
4) For dinner, she ate 1/3 of the remaining 6 slices, which is 2 slices.
5) That leaves 6 - 2 = 4 slices remaining.

Answer: 4 slices are left for Donna's lunch tomorrow.
