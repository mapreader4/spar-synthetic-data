Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The second lady walked 4 miles
* The first lady walked twice as far as the second lady
* To find the distance the first lady walked, we multiply the second lady's distance by 2:
  * 4 miles x 2 = 8 miles
* To find the combined total distance the two ladies walked, we add the distances together:
  * 4 miles (second lady) + 8 miles (first lady) = 12 miles

Answer: 12 miles
