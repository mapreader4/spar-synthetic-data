Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kenny played basketball for 10 hours last week
* He ran for twice as long as he played basketball
* To find how long he ran, we multiply the basketball time by 2:
   - 10 hours of basketball x 2 = 20 hours of running
* He practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran
* To find how long he practiced on the trumpet, we multiply the running time by 2:
   - 20 hours of running x 2 = 40 hours of trumpet practice

Answer: 40
