Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The shipping boat's crew consisted of 17 sailors, with 5 of them being inexperienced.
* The 5 inexperienced sailors were paid $10 per hour for a 60-hour workweek.
* Each experienced sailor was paid 1/5 times more than the inexperienced sailors.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings of the 5 inexperienced sailors:
* 5 sailors x $10 per hour x 60 hours per week = $3,000 per week

Now, let's calculate the hourly rate of the experienced sailors:
* Inexperienced sailors: $10 per hour
* Experienced sailors: $10 per hour + 1/5 of $10 per hour = $12 per hour

There are 12 experienced sailors (17 total - 5 inexperienced = 12 experienced).

To calculate the total monthly earnings of the experienced sailors, we need to:
* Calculate the weekly earnings of the experienced sailors
* Multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to get the monthly earnings

Weekly earnings of experienced sailors:
* 12 sailors x $12 per hour x 60 hours per week = $8,640 per week

Monthly earnings of experienced sailors:
* $8,640 per week x 4 weeks per month = $34,560 per month

Answer: $34,560
