Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jen has 10 more ducks than four times the number of chickens.
2) This means that the number of ducks is equal to 4 times the number of chickens plus 10.
3) We are told that Jen has 150 ducks.
4) So we can set up an equation: 150 = 4x + 10, where x is the number of chickens.
5) Solving for x, we get: 150 - 10 = 4x, so x = 35.
6) Therefore, Jen has 35 chickens.
7) To find the total number of birds, we add the number of ducks and chickens:
   150 ducks + 35 chickens = 185 total birds.

Answer: 185
