Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Johnny has been practicing the same amount each day
* 20 days ago, he had half as much practice as he has currently
* We want to find how many days will pass before he has 3 times as much practice as he has currently

Let's call the amount of practice Johnny has currently as "x".
* 20 days ago, he had 1/2 of x, which is x/2
* We want to find how many days it will take for him to have 3x

We can set up an equation:
* x/2 + (current number of days) = 3x

Solving for the current number of days:
* x/2 + (current number of days) = 3x
* x/2 + (current number of days) = 3x
* x/2 = 2x
* x = 2x
* x = 0

This is not possible, as Johnny currently has a non-zero amount of practice.

Let's try a different approach:
* 20 days ago, he had x/2 practice
* Currently, he has x practice
* In (x) more days, he will have 3x practice

We can set up an equation:
* x/2 + x + x = 3x
* 2.5x = 3x
* 0.5x = x
* x = 2

Therefore, it will take 2 more days for Johnny to have 3 times as much practice as he does currently.
