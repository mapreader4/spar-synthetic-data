Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John writes a book every 2 months
* He has been writing for 20 years
* He earns an average of $30,000 per book

To calculate the total money he has made writing:
* In 1 year, he writes 6 books (12 months / 2 months per book)
* In 20 years, he writes 120 books (6 books per year x 20 years)
* Each book earns him $30,000 on average
* So the total money he has made is 120 books x $30,000 per book = $3,600,000

Answer: $3,600,000
