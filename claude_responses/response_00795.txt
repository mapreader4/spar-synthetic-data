Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Samson ate 3 sandwiches for lunch
* For dinner on Monday, he ate twice as many sandwiches as he did for lunch, which is 2 x 3 = 6 sandwiches
* So on Monday, Samson ate a total of 3 + 6 = 9 sandwiches
* On Tuesday, Samson only ate 1 sandwich for breakfast
* To find the difference in the number of sandwiches Samson ate on Monday versus Tuesday, we subtract the number of sandwiches he ate on Tuesday from the number he ate on Monday:
* 9 sandwiches (Monday) - 1 sandwich (Tuesday) = 8 more sandwiches

Answer: 8
