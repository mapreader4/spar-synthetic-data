Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mobius can run at 13 miles per hour when unloaded
* Mobius can run at 11 miles per hour when carrying a typical load
* The distance from Florence to Rome is 143 miles
* Mobius takes two 30-minute rest stops during each half of the trip

First, let's calculate the time it takes Mobius to travel from Florence to Rome while carrying a typical load:
* Distance: 143 miles
* Speed: 11 miles per hour
* Rest stops: 2 x 30 minutes = 1 hour
* Time to travel from Florence to Rome = 143 miles / 11 miles per hour + 1 hour = 14 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Mobius to travel from Rome to Florence without carrying a load:
* Distance: 143 miles
* Speed: 13 miles per hour
* Rest stops: 2 x 30 minutes = 1 hour
* Time to travel from Rome to Florence = 143 miles / 13 miles per hour + 1 hour = 12 hours

Therefore, the total time for the round trip is:
* 14 hours (Florence to Rome) + 12 hours (Rome to Florence) = 26 hours

Answer: 26 hours
