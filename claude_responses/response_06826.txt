Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lindsay has 4 dolls with blonde hair
* She has four times more dolls with brown hair than blonde hair
* So, the number of dolls with brown hair is 4 x 4 = 16
* She has 2 fewer dolls with black hair than brown hair
* So, the number of dolls with black hair is 16 - 2 = 14
* The total number of dolls with black and brown hair combined is 16 + 14 = 30
* The difference between the number of dolls with black and brown hair combined and the number of dolls with blonde hair is 30 - 4 = 26
