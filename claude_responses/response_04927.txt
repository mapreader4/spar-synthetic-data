Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackie climbed a 1000 foot tall tree
* Then she climbed 2 trees that were half as tall as the first tree
   - Each of these 2 trees was 1000 / 2 = 500 feet tall
* Finally, she climbed a tree that was 200 feet taller than her first tree
   - This tree was 1000 + 200 = 1200 feet tall

Now, to calculate the average height of the trees Jackie climbed, we need to add up the heights of all the trees and divide by the total number of trees:
* Total height of all trees = 1000 + 500 + 500 + 1200 = 3200 feet
* Number of trees = 4
* Average height = 3200 / 4 = 800 feet

Answer: 800
