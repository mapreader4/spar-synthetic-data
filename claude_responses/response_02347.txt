Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adam has 6 candies.
2) James has 3 times the number of candies that Adam has. So, if Adam has 6 candies, then James has 3 x 6 = 18 candies.
3) Rubert has 4 times the number of candies that James has. So, if James has 18 candies, then Rubert has 4 x 18 = 72 candies.
4) To find the total number of candies the three of them have, we add up the number of candies each person has:
Adam has 6 candies
James has 18 candies
Rubert has 72 candies
6 + 18 + 72 = 96 candies

Answer: 96
