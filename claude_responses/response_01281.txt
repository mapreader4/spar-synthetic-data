Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 rows of gold bars in the safe
* Each row has 20 gold bars
* So the total number of gold bars in the safe is 4 rows x 20 bars per row = 80 gold bars
* Each gold bar is worth $20,000
* To calculate the total worth of the gold bars, we multiply the number of gold bars (80) by the value of each gold bar ($20,000)
* 80 gold bars x $20,000 per bar = $1,600,000

Answer: $1,600,000
