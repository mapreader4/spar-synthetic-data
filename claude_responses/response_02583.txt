Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Cindy was hired to teach 4 math courses.
2. She is required to be in the classroom for 48 hours a week altogether.
3. Her hourly rate per class is $25.
4. We need to find how much Cindy earned for teaching 1 math course in a month with exactly 4 weeks.

First, let's calculate how many hours Cindy spends teaching each course per week:
* 48 hours per week / 4 courses = 12 hours per course per week

Now, let's calculate how much Cindy earns per course per week:
* 12 hours per course per week x $25 per hour = $300 per course per week

Finally, let's calculate how much Cindy earned for teaching 1 math course in a month with exactly 4 weeks:
* $300 per course per week x 4 weeks = $1,200

Answer: $1,200
