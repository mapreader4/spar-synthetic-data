Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total contributions from the attendees were $100 per person
* There were 50 people at the party
* The total contributions would be 50 people x $100 per person = $5,000
* The total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions
* So the total expenses were $5,000 - $500 = $4,500

Therefore, the amount of money used to pay for the party expenses is:
Answer: $4,500
