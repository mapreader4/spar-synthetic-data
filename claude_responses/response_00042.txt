Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The family of monkeys collected 10 piles of bananas
2) 6 piles had 9 hands, with each hand having 14 bananas
   * For these 6 piles, the total number of bananas is: 6 * 9 * 14 = 756 bananas
3) The remaining 4 piles had 12 hands, with each hand having 9 bananas
   * For these 4 piles, the total number of bananas is: 4 * 12 * 9 = 432 bananas
4) The total number of bananas collected is the sum of the bananas in the 6 piles and the 4 piles:
   * 756 + 432 = 1188 bananas
5) The family of monkeys has 12 members
6) To divide the 1188 bananas equally amongst the 12 monkeys, we divide 1188 by 12:
   * 1188 / 12 = 99 bananas per monkey

Answer: 99
