Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wanda has 62 crayons.
2) Dina has 28 crayons.
3) Jacob has two fewer crayons than Dina, so Jacob has 28 - 2 = 26 crayons.
4) To find the total number of crayons, we add up the crayons that Wanda, Dina, and Jacob have:
62 + 28 + 26 = 116 crayons.

Answer: 116
