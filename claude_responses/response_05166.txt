Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The theater sold 18 more than three times the number of tickets to the horror movie as it did to the romance movie.
2) The theater sold 25 tickets to the romance movie.
3) Let's call the number of tickets sold to the horror movie 'x'.
4) We know that the number of tickets sold to the horror movie is 18 more than three times the number of tickets sold to the romance movie.
5) So, we can write the equation: x = 3 * 25 + 18
6) Solving for x, we get: x = 75 + 18 = 93
Answer: 93
