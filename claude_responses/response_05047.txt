Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, Lucia sent 120 messages, and Alina sent 20 fewer messages than Lucia, so Alina sent 120 - 20 = 100 messages.

2. On the second day, Lucia sent 1/3 of the messages she sent the previous day, which is 120 / 3 = 40 messages. Alina doubled the messages she sent on the first day, which is 100 x 2 = 200 messages.

3. On the third day, they sent the same number of messages as the first day, so Lucia sent 120 messages and Alina sent 100 messages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of messages they sent in those three days:

First day:
Lucia: 120 messages
Alina: 100 messages
Total: 120 + 100 = 220 messages

Second day:
Lucia: 40 messages
Alina: 200 messages
Total: 40 + 200 = 240 messages

Third day:
Lucia: 120 messages
Alina: 100 messages
Total: 120 + 100 = 220 messages

The total number of messages they sent in those three days is:
220 + 240 + 220 = 680 messages

Answer: 680
