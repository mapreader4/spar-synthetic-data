Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* There were 10 students in the first class
* The second class also had 10 students
* So the total number of students was 10 + 10 = 20 students
* 5 parents offered to be chaperones
* 2 teachers from both classes were there
* So the total number of adults was 5 + 2 = 7 adults
* At the end of the day, 10 students left
* 2 of the chaperones were parents in that group, so they left as well
* So the total number of individuals that left was 10 students + 2 chaperones = 12 individuals
* The total number of individuals that were left at the zoo is the initial total minus the number of individuals that left:
* Initial total: 20 students + 7 adults = 27 individuals
* Number of individuals that left: 12
* Number of individuals left at the zoo: 27 - 12 = 15

Answer: 15
