To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times Tony will fill the 84-ounce water bottle each week.

Given information:
- Tony drinks 72 ounces of water per day.
- Tony buys an 84-ounce water bottle.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water Tony drinks in a week.
Total water consumed in a week = 72 ounces per day Ã— 7 days per week = 504 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the number of times Tony will fill the 84-ounce water bottle each week.
Number of times the water bottle is filled per week = Total water consumed in a week / Capacity of the water bottle
Number of times the water bottle is filled per week = 504 ounces / 84 ounces = 6 times

Answer: 6
