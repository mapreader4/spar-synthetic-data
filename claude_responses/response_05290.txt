Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Antonia received a total of 400 emails
* 1/4 of the 400 emails were spam emails
* To calculate the number of spam emails, we take 1/4 of 400:
    * 1/4 * 400 = 100 spam emails
* Now, we need to find the number of non-spam emails
* The total number of non-spam emails is 400 - 100 = 300 emails
* 2/5 of the 300 non-spam emails were promotional messages
* To calculate the number of promotional messages, we take 2/5 of 300:
    * 2/5 * 300 = 120 promotional messages
* The remaining emails are the important emails
* To calculate the number of important emails, we take the total non-spam emails (300) and subtract the promotional messages (120):
    * 300 - 120 = 180 important emails

Answer: 180
