Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Angela originally had 24 pieces of rare action figures.
2) She sold off a quarter of them at the pawnshop. To find the number she sold, we take 1/4 of 24, which is 6.
3) So, she had 24 - 6 = 18 pieces left after selling a quarter of them.
4) She then gave one-third of the remaining 18 pieces to her daughter. To find the number she gave away, we take 1/3 of 18, which is 6.
5) So, she had 18 - 6 = 12 pieces left after giving one-third of the remainder to her daughter.
