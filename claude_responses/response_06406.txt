Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Enrico sells each rooster for $0.50 per kilogram.
2) He sold a 30-kilogram rooster and a 40-kilogram rooster.
3) For the 30-kilogram rooster, he would earn:
   * 30 kg x $0.50 per kg = $15
4) For the 40-kilogram rooster, he would earn:
   * 40 kg x $0.50 per kg = $20
5) To calculate the total amount of money he earned, we add the earnings from both roosters:
   * $15 + $20 = $35

Answer: $35
