Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The total number of cards in the game is 500.
2) The cards are divided between Ellis and Orion in the ratio of 11:9.
3) To find the number of cards each person got, we need to divide the total number of cards by the sum of the ratio.
4) The sum of the ratio is 11 + 9 = 20.
5) So the number of cards Ellis got is (11/20) * 500 = 275.
6) The number of cards Orion got is (9/20) * 500 = 225.
7) The difference between the number of cards Ellis got and the number of cards Orion got is 275 - 225 = 50.

Answer: 50
