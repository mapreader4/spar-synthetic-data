Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 2 packs of gum and 3 candy bars
* Each stick of gum costs half as much as the candy bar
* The candy bar costs $1.5 each

First, we need to find the cost of each stick of gum:
* Since each stick of gum costs half as much as the candy bar, and the candy bar costs $1.5, each stick of gum costs $0.75

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gum:
* 2 packs of gum, with 5 sticks per pack, so 10 sticks of gum
* 10 sticks of gum at $0.75 each, so the total cost of the gum is $7.50

Next, we can calculate the total cost of the candy bars:
* 3 candy bars at $1.5 each, so the total cost of the candy bars is $4.50

Finally, we can add the cost of the gum and the cost of the candy bars to get the total amount John paid:
* Total cost = Cost of gum + Cost of candy bars
* Total cost = $7.50 + $4.50 = $12.00

Answer: $12
