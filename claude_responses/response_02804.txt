Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Trent cries 2 tears for every 3 onions he chops
* He needs to chop 4 onions per pot of soup
* He is making 6 pots of soup

First, we need to calculate the total number of onions he needs to chop:
* 4 onions per pot x 6 pots = 24 onions

Now, we can calculate the number of tears he cries:
* For every 3 onions, he cries 2 tears
* 24 onions / 3 = 8 sets of 3 onions
* 8 sets of 3 onions x 2 tears per set = 16 tears

Therefore, the total number of tears Trent cries is:
Answer: 16
