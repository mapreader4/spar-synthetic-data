Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Eric has 4 ninja throwing stars.
2) Chad has twice as many as Eric, so Chad has 2 x 4 = 8 ninja throwing stars.
3) Jeff bought 2 ninja throwing stars from Chad, so now Chad has 8 - 2 = 6 ninja throwing stars.
4) Jeff now has 6 throwing stars.
5) To find the total number of ninja throwing stars, we add up the number of stars that each person has:
Eric has 4 stars
Chad has 6 stars
Jeff has 6 stars
Total = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16 ninja throwing stars

Answer: 16
