Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Josiah is three times as old as Hans.
2) Hans is 15 years old now.
3) We want to find the sum of the ages of Josiah and Hans in three years.

First, let's find Josiah's current age:
* Since Josiah is three times as old as Hans, and Hans is 15 years old, that means Josiah is 3 x 15 = 45 years old.

Now, in three years:
* Hans will be 15 + 3 = 18 years old.
* Josiah will be 45 + 3 = 48 years old.

The sum of their ages in three years will be:
* Hans (18 years old) + Josiah (48 years old) = 18 + 48 = 66 years old.

Answer: 66
