Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Casey takes 6 hours to complete the marathon race
* Zendaya takes 1/3 times longer to cover the same distance
* To find how long Zendaya takes, we need to multiply Casey's time by 1.33 (since 1/3 longer is the same as 1.33 times longer)
* 6 hours x 1.33 = 8 hours
* Now we need to find the average time of the two:
* (6 hours + 8 hours) / 2 = 7 hours

Answer: 7 hours
