Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that Ashley needs 69 kg of tomatoes to make 3 liters of ketchup.
2) We want to find how many kilos of tomatoes Ashley needs to make 5 liters of ketchup.
3) We can set up a proportion to solve this:
3 liters of ketchup / 69 kg of tomatoes = 5 liters of ketchup / x kg of tomatoes
4) Cross-multiplying, we get:
3x = 345
5) Solving for x, we get:
x = 115
Answer: 115 kg of tomatoes
