Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Emily can type 60 words per minute
* We need to find how long it takes her to type 10,800 words
* To do this, we need to divide the total number of words (10,800) by the number of words she can type per minute (60)
* 10,800 words / 60 words per minute = 180 minutes
* Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours
* 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours

Answer: 3 hours
