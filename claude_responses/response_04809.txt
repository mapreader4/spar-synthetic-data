Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry owes the loan shark $200 initially.
* The loan shark charges 10% interest compounded monthly.
* This means that every month, the loan shark adds the interest amount to Jerry's loan, and the next month Jerry has to pay 10% on the new total.

To calculate the interest charged in the second month:
* In the first month, the interest charged is 10% of $200, which is $20.
* So the new total loan amount is $200 + $20 = $220.
* In the second month, the interest charged is 10% of $220, which is $22.

Answer: $22
