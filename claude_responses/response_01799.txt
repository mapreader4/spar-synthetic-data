Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Guitar Center's Price:
* Suggested retail price: $1000
* Discount: 15% off
* Discount amount: $1000 * 0.15 = $150
* Price after discount: $1000 - $150 = $850
* Shipping fee: $100
* Total price at Guitar Center: $850 + $100 = $950

Sweetwater's Price:
* Suggested retail price: $1000
* Discount: 10% off
* Discount amount: $1000 * 0.10 = $100
* Price after discount: $1000 - $100 = $900
* Shipping fee: $0 (free shipping)
* Total price at Sweetwater: $900

Now, to find the difference in savings:
* Guitar Center price: $950
