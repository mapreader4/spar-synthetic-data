Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Borgnine wants to see 1100 legs at the zoo
* He has already seen:
  - 12 chimps, each with 2 legs, so 12 * 2 = 24 legs
  - 8 lions, each with 4 legs, so 8 * 4 = 32 legs
  - 5 lizards, each with 4 legs, so 5 * 4 = 20 legs
* So the total number of legs he has seen so far is 24 + 32 + 20 = 76 legs
* He still needs to see 1100 - 76 = 1024 more legs
* Tarantulas have 8 legs each
* To get 1024 more legs, he needs to see 1024 / 8 = 128 tarantulas

Answer: 128
