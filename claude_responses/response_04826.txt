Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tyson scored 3 points 15 times
* 3 points x 15 times = 45 points
* Tyson scored 2 points 12 times
* 2 points x 12 times = 24 points
* Tyson scored 1 point some number of times, let's call this number x
* The total points scored is 75
* So, the total points can be calculated as:
* 45 points (from 3 points) + 24 points (from 2 points) + 1 point x (from 1 point) = 75 points
* Solving for x:
* 45 + 24 + 1x = 75
* 69 + 1x = 75
* 1x = 6
* x = 6
Therefore, Tyson scored 1 point 6 times.
