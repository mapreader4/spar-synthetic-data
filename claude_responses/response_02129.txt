Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farmer sells 5 chickens at $8 each, so he earns 5 * $8 = $40 from the chickens.
* The farmer also sells some ducks at $10 each. Let's call the number of ducks he sells "x".
* So the total earnings from the chickens and ducks is $40 + 10x.
* The farmer then spends half of this earnings on a new wheelbarrow, so he spends (40 + 10x)/2 = 20 + 5x.
* Someone then buys the wheelbarrow for double what the farmer paid, so the farmer earns another $60.
* Since the farmer earned $60 from selling the wheelbarrow, we can set up an equation:
20 + 5x = 60
* Solving for x, we get:
x = 8
Therefore, the farmer sold 8 ducks.

Answer: 8
