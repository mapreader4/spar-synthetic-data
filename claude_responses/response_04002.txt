Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeremy is taking 1000 mg of Tylenol every 6 hours
* There are 24 hours in a day, so he is taking the Tylenol 4 times a day (24 hours / 6 hours = 4)
* Each pill is 500 mg
* He is taking this regimen for 2 weeks, which is 14 days

To calculate the total number of pills:
* 1000 mg per dose / 500 mg per pill = 2 pills per dose
* 2 pills per dose x 4 doses per day = 8 pills per day
* 8 pills per day x 14 days = 112 pills

Answer: 112 pills
