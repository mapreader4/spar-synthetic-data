Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first bear costs $4.00
* Each additional bear after the first one has a 50 cent discount
* Wally is buying 101 bears

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the first bear and the cost of the remaining 100 bears with the discount.

The cost of the first bear is $4.00.
The cost of the remaining 100 bears with the 50 cent discount is:
* 100 bears x $3.50 per bear = $350

The total cost is the cost of the first bear plus the cost of the remaining 100 bears:
* $4.00 + $350 = $354

Answer: $354
