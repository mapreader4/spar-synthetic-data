Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, you did 30 squats
* Each day, you plan to increase the number of squats by 5 more than the previous day
* You will do your workout for four consecutive days

So, let's calculate the number of squats for each day:
* Day 1: 30 squats
* Day 2: 30 + 5 = 35 squats
* Day 3: 35 + 5 = 40 squats
* Day 4: 40 + 5 = 45 squats

The day after tomorrow is the fifth day, so the number of squats you will perform is:
* Day 5: 45 + 5 = 50 squats

Answer: 50
