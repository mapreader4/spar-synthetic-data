Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Connell harvested 60 apples from his apple tree
* He harvested 3 times as many peaches from his peach tree
* To find the number of peaches, we multiply the number of apples by 3:
* 60 apples x 3 = 180 peaches
* Now, to find the difference between the number of apples and peaches, we subtract the number of apples from the number of peaches:
* 180 peaches - 60 apples = 120

Answer: 120
