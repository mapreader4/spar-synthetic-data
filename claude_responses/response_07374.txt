Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Grace baked 4 whole pumpkin pies
* She sold 1 whole pumpkin pie, so she had 3 whole pies remaining
* She gave 1 whole pumpkin pie to her friend, so she had 2 whole pies remaining
* The 2 remaining whole pies were each sliced into 6 pieces, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 pieces
* Her family ate 2/3 of the 12 pieces, which is 2/3 * 12 = 8 pieces
* Therefore, the number of pieces of pumpkin pie left is 12 - 8 = 4 pieces
