Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Betty picked 16 strawberries
* Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, so he picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries
* Natalie picked half as many strawberries as Matthew, so she picked 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries
* In total, they picked 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries
* Each jar of jam used 7 strawberries
* So they were able to make 70 / 7 = 10 jars of jam
* They sold each jar for $4
* Therefore, the total money they were able to make is 10 jars * $4 per jar = $40

Answer: $40
