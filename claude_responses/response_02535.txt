Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jamie earns $10 per hour delivering flyers
* She delivers flyers 2 days each week
* It takes her 3 hours each time she delivers flyers
* She delivers flyers for 6 weeks

First, let's calculate how much she earns per day:
* 3 hours per delivery x $10 per hour = $30 per day

Next, let's calculate how much she earns per week:
* $30 per day x 2 days per week = $60 per week

Finally, let's calculate how much she earns over 6 weeks:
* $60 per week x 6 weeks = $360

Answer: $360
