Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The dress's hem is 3 feet long
* Each stitch Jenna makes is 1/4 inch long
* Jenna makes 24 stitches per minute

First, we need to convert the length of the dress's hem from feet to inches:
* 3 feet = 36 inches

Next, we need to calculate how many stitches Jenna needs to make to hem the dress:
* 36 inches / 1/4 inch per stitch = 144 stitches

Finally, we can calculate how long it will take Jenna to make 144 stitches at a rate of 24 stitches per minute:
* 144 stitches / 24 stitches per minute = 6 minutes

Answer: 6 minutes
