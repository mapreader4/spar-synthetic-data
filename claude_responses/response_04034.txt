Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* There are 80 students who took the biology exam
* 2/5 of the 80 students scored 100%
* 2/5 of 80 = 0.4 * 80 = 32 students scored 100%
* The remaining students who didn't score 100% are 80 - 32 = 48 students
* 50% of the 48 students scored over 80%
* 50% of 48 = 0.5 * 48 = 24 students scored over 80%
* The remaining students who scored below 80% are 48 - 24 = 24 students
* Therefore, the number of students who failed the exam is 24.

Answer: 24
