Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) David broke 2 glasses.
2) William broke 4 times the number of glasses David broke.
3) To find the number of glasses William broke, we multiply the number of glasses David broke (2) by 4.
4) 2 x 4 = 8 glasses broken by William.
5) To find the total number of glasses broken, we add the number of glasses broken by David (2) and the number of glasses broken by William (8).
6) 2 + 8 = 10 glasses broken in total.
