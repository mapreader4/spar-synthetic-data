Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of salt, which contains 2 * 50 mg = 100 mg of sodium.
2) The recipe also calls for 8 oz of parmesan cheese, which contains 8 * 25 mg = 200 mg of sodium.
3) The total amount of sodium in the recipe is 100 mg + 200 mg = 300 mg.
4) James wants to reduce the total amount of sodium by 1/3rd, which means he needs to reduce the sodium by 100 mg.
5) Since he can't reduce the salt, he needs to reduce the amount of parmesan cheese.
6) To reduce the sodium from the parmesan cheese by 100 mg, he needs to reduce the amount of parmesan cheese by 100 mg / 25 mg per oz = 4 oz.
