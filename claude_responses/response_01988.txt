Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackson and Brandon both initially invest $500 in the stock market.
* Jackson's investment quadruples in value, meaning it is now worth 4 times the initial $500, which is $2,000.
* Brandon's investment is reduced to 20% of the initial $500, which is $100.
* To find how much more money Jackson has than Brandon, we need to subtract Brandon's final amount from Jackson's final amount.
* Jackson's final amount: $2,000
* Brandon's final amount: $100
* $2,000 - $100 = $1,900

Answer: $1,900
