Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carl saved $25 each week for 6 weeks.
2) This means he saved a total of $25 x 6 = $150 in the first 6 weeks.
3) On the seventh week, he had to use a third of his savings to pay some bills.
4) One third of $150 is $50, so he had to use $50 to pay the bills.
5) This means he had $150 - $50 = $100 left in his savings after the seventh week.
6) The coat costs $170, so he still needs an additional amount of money to buy the coat.
7) The amount of money his dad gave him is the difference between the cost of the coat ($170) and the amount of money Carl had saved ($100).
8) Therefore, the amount of money his dad gave him is: $170 - $100 = $70.

Answer: $70
