Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hiram's age is 40 years old
* We are told that when you take Hiram's age and add 12, you get 4 less than twice Allyson's age
* So, we can represent this as an equation:
* Hiram's age + 12 = 2 * Allyson's age - 4
* Substituting Hiram's age of 40, we get:
* 40 + 12 = 2 * Allyson's age - 4
* Simplifying:
* 52 = 2 * Allyson's age - 4
* Adding 4 to both sides:
* 56 = 2 * Allyson's age
* Dividing both sides by 2:
* 28 = Allyson's age

Answer: 28
