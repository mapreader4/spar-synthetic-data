Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 adults in the group
* Each adult meal costs $6
* So the total cost for the adult meals is 6 adults x $6 per meal = $36
* There are 2 children in the group
* Each children's meal costs $4
* So the total cost for the children's meals is 2 children x $4 per meal = $8
* Each person ordered a soda, which costs $2 per soda
* There are 6 adults + 2 children = 8 people
* So the total cost for the sodas is 8 people x $2 per soda = $16
* To calculate the total bill, we add up the costs for the adult meals, children's meals, and sodas:
* $36 + $8 + $16 = $60

Answer: $60
