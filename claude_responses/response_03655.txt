Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martha needs 1.5kg of cheese, which costs $6 per kilogram.
   * Cost of cheese = 1.5kg x $6/kg = $9
2) Martha needs 500 grams of meat, which costs $8 per kilogram.
   * 500 grams = 0.5kg
   * Cost of meat = 0.5kg x $8/kg = $4
3) To calculate the total cost, we add the cost of the cheese and the cost of the meat:
   * Total cost = $9 + $4 = $13

Answer: $13
