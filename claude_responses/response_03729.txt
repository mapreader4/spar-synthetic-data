Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Stan has 10 songs that are 3 minutes each
* So the total time for the 10 songs that are 3 minutes each is:
  * 10 songs x 3 minutes per song = 30 minutes
* Stan also has 15 songs that are 2 minutes each
* So the total time for the 15 songs that are 2 minutes each is:
  * 15 songs x 2 minutes per song = 30 minutes
* The total time for all the songs is:
  * 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes
* The entire run takes 100 minutes
* To find how many more minutes of songs Stan needs, we subtract the total song time from the total run time:
  * 100 minutes - 60 minutes = 40 minutes

Answer: 40
