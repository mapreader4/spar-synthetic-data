To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pies sold by Milton during the weekend.

Given information:
- Milton cuts the apple pie into 8 slices.
- Milton cuts the peach pie into 6 slices.
- 56 customers ordered apple pie slices.
- 48 customers ordered peach pie slices.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apple pies sold.
Number of apple pies sold = Total apple pie slices ordered / Number of slices per apple pie
Number of apple pies sold = 56 / 8 = 7 apple pies

Step 2: Calculate the number of peach pies sold.
Number of peach pies sold = Total peach pie slices ordered / Number of slices per peach pie
Number of peach pies sold = 48 / 6 = 8 peach pies

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pies sold.
Total pies sold = Number of apple pies sold + Number of peach pies sold
Total pies sold = 7 + 8 = 15 pies

Answer: 15 pies
