Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ed and Jacob already had 2 shells in their collection.
2) Ed found 7 limpet shells, 2 oyster shells, and 4 conch shells. So the total number of shells Ed found is 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 shells.
3) Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed, so Jacob found 13 + 2 = 15 shells.
4) The total number of shells the pair have is the 2 shells they already had, plus the 13 shells Ed found, plus the 15 shells Jacob found. So the total number of shells is 2 + 13 + 15 = 30 shells.

Answer: 30
