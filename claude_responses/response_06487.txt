Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Zack's number of marbles can be divided equally among three people, leaving Zack with 5.
2) This means that Zack's initial number of marbles was a multiple of 3, plus 5.
3) Zack then gave his three friends 20 marbles each, which is 60 marbles total.
4) Zack kept 5 marbles for himself.
5) So the total number of marbles Zack had initially was the 60 marbles he gave away, plus the 5 he kept, which is 65.

Answer: 65
