Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The tallest building is 100 feet tall.
2) The second tallest building is half as tall as the tallest, so it is 100 / 2 = 50 feet tall.
3) The third tallest building is half as tall as the second, so it is 50 / 2 = 25 feet tall.
4) The fourth tallest building is one-fifth as tall as the third, so it is 25 / 5 = 5 feet tall.
5) To find the total height of all 4 buildings, we add up their individual heights:
100 feet + 50 feet + 25 feet + 5 feet = 180 feet.

Answer: 180
