Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Cynthia's room is 8 feet tall.
2) She wants the curtains to have an additional 5 inches of material to pool at the bottom.
3) To convert 8 feet to inches, we multiply 8 by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
8 feet x 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
4) Adding the additional 5 inches of material, the total length of the curtains needs to be:
96 inches + 5 inches = 101 inches
Answer: 101
