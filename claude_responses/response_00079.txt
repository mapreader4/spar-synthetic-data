Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James spends 40 years teaching
* His partner has been teaching for 10 years less than James
* To find the partner's teaching experience, we subtract 10 years from James' 40 years
* 40 years - 10 years = 30 years
* So, the partner has been teaching for 30 years
* To find the combined experience, we add James' 40 years and the partner's 30 years
* 40 years + 30 years = 70 years

Answer: 70 years
