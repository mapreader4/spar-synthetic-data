Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Liza bought 10 kilograms of butter
* She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies
* One-half of 10 kilograms is 5 kilograms
* She used one-fifth of the 10 kilograms for peanut butter cookies
* One-fifth of 10 kilograms is 2 kilograms
* That leaves 10 - 5 - 2 = 3 kilograms of butter remaining
* She then used one-third of the remaining 3 kilograms for sugar cookies
* One-third of 3 kilograms is 1 kilogram
* So the amount of butter left after making the three kinds of cookies is 3 - 1 = 2 kilograms

Answer: 2 kilograms
