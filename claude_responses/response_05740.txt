Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Anna bought 50 eBook readers.
2) John bought 15 eBook readers less than Anna, so John bought 50 - 15 = 35 eBook readers.
3) John then lost 3 eBook readers, so he has 35 - 3 = 32 eBook readers remaining.
4) To find the total number of eBook readers they have altogether, we add Anna's 50 eBook readers and John's 32 eBook readers:
50 + 32 = 82 eBook readers.

Answer: 82
