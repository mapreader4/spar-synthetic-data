Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The dog initially had some unknown number of fleas.
* After the first treatment, half of the fleas were eliminated.
* After the second treatment, half of the remaining fleas were eliminated.
* After the third treatment, half of the remaining fleas were eliminated.
* After the fourth treatment, the dog had 14 fleas left.

Let's represent the initial number of fleas as "x".
* After the first treatment, the number of fleas was x/2.
* After the second treatment, the number of fleas was (x/2)/2 = x/4.
* After the third treatment, the number of fleas was (x/4)/2 = x/8.
* After the fourth treatment, the number of fleas was (x/8) = 14.

Solving for x, we get:
* x/8 = 14
* x = 112

Therefore, the dog had 112 fleas before the treatments, and 14 fleas after the treatments.
