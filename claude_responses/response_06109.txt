Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Susan bought 3 candies on Tuesday
* She bought 5 candies on Thursday
* She bought 2 candies on Friday
* So the total number of candies she bought is:
    - Tuesday: 3 candies
    - Thursday: 5 candies
    - Friday: 2 candies
    - Total: 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 candies
* Susan has 4 candies left
* To find the number of candies she ate, we take the total number of candies she bought (10) and subtract the number of candies she has left (4)
* 10 - 4 = 6 candies
