Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brandon sold 86 geckos last year
* The year before, he sold twice as many geckos as he did last year
* To find the number of geckos he sold the year before, we multiply 86 by 2:
  * 86 x 2 = 172 geckos

Now, to find the total number of geckos Brandon has sold in the last two years, we add the number of geckos he sold last year and the year before:
* 86 + 172 = 258 geckos

Answer: 258
