Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The factory originally employed 852 people.
* 25% more workers have just been hired.
* To calculate the 25% increase:
  * 25% of 852 = 0.25 * 852 = 213
* So, the number of new workers hired is 213.
* To find the total number of employees now, we add the original 852 employees to the 213 new hires:
  * 852 + 213 = 1,065

Answer: 1,065
