Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James listens to music that is 200 beats per minute
* He listens to 2 hours of music per day
* To calculate the number of beats per week, we need to:
  1. Calculate the number of beats per day
  2. Multiply the number of beats per day by the number of days in a week

Calculating the number of beats per day:
* 200 beats per minute
* 2 hours per day = 120 minutes per day
* 200 beats per minute x 120 minutes per day = 24,000 beats per day

Calculating the number of beats per week:
* 24,000 beats per day
* 7 days per week
* 24,000 beats per day x 7 days per week = 168,000 beats per week

Answer: 168,000
