Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
* Ben whitewashed 10 feet of the fence.
* After Ben's work, there are 100 - 10 = 90 feet of the fence left to be whitewashed.
* Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining 90 feet, which is 90 / 5 = 18 feet.
* After Billy's work, there are 90 - 18 = 72 feet of the fence left to be whitewashed.
* Johnny whitewashed a third of the remaining 72 feet, which is 72 / 3 = 24 feet.
* After Johnny's work, there are 72 - 24 = 48 feet of the fence left to be whitewashed.
