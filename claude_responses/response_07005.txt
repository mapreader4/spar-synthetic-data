Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The surface area of the moon is 1/5 that of the Earth.
2) The surface area of the Earth is 200 square acres.
3) Therefore, the surface area of the moon is 1/5 of 200 square acres, which is 40 square acres.
4) The land on the moon is worth 6 times that of the land on the Earth.
5) The total value of all the land on the Earth is 80 billion dollars.
6) Therefore, the value of the land on the Earth is 80 billion dollars.
7) Since the land on the moon is worth 6 times that of the land on the Earth, the value of the land on the moon is 6 times 80 billion dollars, which is 480 billion dollars.

Answer: 480 billion dollars.
