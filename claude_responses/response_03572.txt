Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eliza can iron a blouse in 15 minutes
* Eliza can iron a dress in 20 minutes
* Eliza spends 2 hours ironing blouses
* Eliza spends 3 hours ironing dresses

First, let's calculate how many blouses Eliza can iron in 2 hours:
* 2 hours = 120 minutes
* 120 minutes / 15 minutes per blouse = 8 blouses

Next, let's calculate how many dresses Eliza can iron in 3 hours:
* 3 hours = 180 minutes
* 180 minutes / 20 minutes per dress = 9 dresses

Now, we can add the number of blouses and dresses to get the total number of pieces of clothes she ironed:
* 8 blouses + 9 dresses = 17 pieces of clothes

Answer: 17
