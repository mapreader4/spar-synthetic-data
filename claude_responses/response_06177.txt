Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lorraine made a pan of brownies and cut them into 16 pieces.
2) Her children ate 25% of the brownies when they got home from school.
   * 25% of 16 brownies = 0.25 * 16 = 4 brownies eaten by the children
   * 16 - 4 = 12 brownies remaining
3) After dinner, the entire family ate 50% of the remaining brownies.
   * 50% of 12 brownies = 0.50 * 12 = 6 brownies eaten by the family
   * 12 - 6 = 6 brownies remaining
4) After everyone went to bed, Lorraine ate 1 more brownie.
   * 6 - 1 = 5 brownies remaining

Answer: 5 brownies are left over.
