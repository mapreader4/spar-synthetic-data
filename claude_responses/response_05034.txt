Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackie spends 8 hours working per day
* Jackie spends 3 hours exercising per day
* Jackie spends 8 hours sleeping per day
* To calculate the total time spent on these activities, we add them up:
   - 8 hours working + 3 hours exercising + 8 hours sleeping = 19 hours
* There are 24 hours in a day
* To calculate the free time Jackie has, we take the total hours in a day (24) and subtract the time spent on the other activities (19 hours)
* 24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours
