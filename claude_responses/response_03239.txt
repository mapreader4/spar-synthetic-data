Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total cost of the accident is $40,000 (property damage) + $70,000 (medical bills) = $110,000.
2) Carl's insurance company will pay 80% of the costs, which means they will pay 0.8 * $110,000 = $88,000.
3) Carl is responsible for the remaining 20% of the costs, which means he personally owes 0.2 * $110,000 = $22,000.

Answer: $22,000
