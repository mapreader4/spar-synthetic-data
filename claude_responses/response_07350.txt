Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tonya spent $90.00 on art supplies in total.
2) 4 canvases cost $40.00.
3) The mixed set of paints cost 1/2 of the cost of the canvases, which is $20.00.
4) Tonya also spent $15.00 on an easel.
5) To find the amount spent on paintbrushes, we need to subtract the cost of the canvases, paints, and easel from the total amount spent:
   $90.00 - $40.00 - $20.00 - $15.00 = $15.00

Answer: $15.00
