Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) All people named Barry are nice, and there are 24 people named Barry in the crowd.
2) Therefore, the number of nice people named Barry is 24.
3) Half of the people named Kevin are nice, and there are 20 people named Kevin in the crowd.
4) Therefore, the number of nice people named Kevin is 20 * 0.5 = 10.
5) Three-fourths of people named Julie are nice, and there are 80 people named Julie in the crowd.
6) Therefore, the number of nice people named Julie is 80 * 0.75 = 60.
7) 10% of people named Joe are nice, and there are 50 people named Joe in the crowd.
8) Therefore, the number of nice people named Joe is 50 * 0.1 = 5.
9) To find the total number of nice people in the crowd, we add up the nice people from each name:
24 + 10 + 60 + 5 = 99

Answer: 99
