Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are two birds making the nest
* Each bird made 10 round trips to collect building materials
* The building materials were located 200 miles from where they were building the nest

To calculate the total distance covered by the birds, we need to:
1. Calculate the distance covered by each bird
2. Multiply that by the number of birds

For each bird:
* 10 round trips
* Each round trip is 200 miles there and 200 miles back, so 400 miles per round trip
* 10 round trips x 400 miles per round trip = 4,000 miles

For the two birds:
* 2 birds x 4,000 miles per bird = 8,000 miles

Answer: 8,000
