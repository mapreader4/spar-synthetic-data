Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Grandma wants to order 5 personalized backpacks.
2) The original price of each backpack is $20.00.
3) The backpacks are 20% off, which means the discounted price of each backpack is $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4) The cost of having each backpack monogrammed is $12.00.
5) The total cost for 5 backpacks at $16.00 each is 5 * $16.00 = $80.00.
6) The total cost for having 5 backpacks monogrammed at $12.00 each is 5 * $12.00 = $60.00.
7) The total cost of the backpacks and monogramming is $80.00 + $60.00 = $140.00.

Answer: $140
