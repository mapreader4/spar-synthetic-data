Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* In the first week, Jodi walks 1 mile per day for 6 days, so that's 1 mile x 6 days = 6 miles.
* In the second week, Jodi walks 2 miles per day for 6 days, so that's 2 miles x 6 days = 12 miles.
* In the third week, Jodi walks 3 miles per day for 6 days, so that's 3 miles x 6 days = 18 miles.
* In the fourth week, Jodi walks 4 miles per day for 6 days, so that's 4 miles x 6 days = 24 miles.

Now, to find the total miles walked in 4 weeks, we add up the miles from each week:
6 miles + 12 miles + 18 miles + 24 miles = 60 miles

Answer: 60
