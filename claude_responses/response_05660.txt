Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Mr. Willson worked for 3/4 of an hour.
2. On Tuesday, he worked for 1/2 an hour.
3. On Wednesday, he worked for 2/3 of an hour.
4. On Thursday, he worked for 5/6 of an hour.
5. On Friday, he worked for 75 minutes, which is 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time he worked from Monday to Friday:
* Monday: 3/4 hour
* Tuesday: 1/2 hour
* Wednesday: 2/3 hour
* Thursday: 5/6 hour
* Friday: 1 hour and 15 minutes (1.25 hours)

Adding these up, we get:
* 3/4 + 1/2 + 2/3 + 5/6 + 1.25 = 3.92 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Mr. Willson worked from Monday to Friday is 3.92 hours.

Answer: 4 hours
