Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) On March 1st, the sun sets at 6 PM.
2) Every day after, the sun sets 1.2 minutes later.
3) It is 6:10 PM and 40 days after March 1st.
4) To find the time the sun sets 40 days after March 1st, we need to calculate the total time the sun sets later each day.
5) 1.2 minutes per day x 40 days = 48 minutes.
6) The sun set at 6 PM on March 1st, so 48 minutes later it would set at 6:48 PM.
7) Since it is currently 6:10 PM, that means there are 38 minutes until the sun sets.

Answer: 38 minutes
