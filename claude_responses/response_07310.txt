Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The chairs were arranged in 7 rows with 12 chairs in each row.
2) To find the total number of chairs in the 7 rows, we can multiply the number of rows (7) by the number of chairs in each row (12):
7 rows x 12 chairs per row = 84 chairs
3) In addition, 11 extra chairs were added at the back.
4) To find the total number of chairs, we add the 84 chairs in the rows and the 11 extra chairs:
84 chairs + 11 extra chairs = 95 chairs

Answer: 95
