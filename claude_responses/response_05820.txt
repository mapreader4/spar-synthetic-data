Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Mrs. Young made 10 bonnets.
* On Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she made twice as many as on Monday, which is 2 x 10 = 20 bonnets.
* On Thursday, she made 5 more than on Monday, which is 10 + 5 = 15 bonnets.
* On Friday, she made 5 less than on Thursday, which is 15 - 5 = 10 bonnets.
* So the total number of bonnets she made is:
  - Monday: 10 bonnets
  - Tuesday and Wednesday: 20 bonnets
  - Thursday: 15 bonnets
  - Friday: 10 bonnets
  - Total: 10 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 55 bonnets
* She then divided the 55 bonnets evenly among 5 orphanages.
* To find the number of bonnets sent to each orphanage, we divide 55 by 5:
  - 55 รท 5 = 11
