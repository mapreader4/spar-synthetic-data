Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Winwin won $50 in the lottery.
2) She paid 20% for the tax. 20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.
3) She also paid a $5 processing fee.
4) To calculate the amount she was able to take home, we need to subtract the tax and processing fee from the total winnings.
5) $50 - $10 (tax) - $5 (processing fee) = $35.

Answer: 35
