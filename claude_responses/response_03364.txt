Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The regular price of each polo shirt is $50.
2) The shirts are on a 40% off rack, which means the discounted price is 60% of the regular price.
3) To find the discounted price, we take the regular price ($50) and multiply it by 0.6 (60%):
$50 x 0.6 = $30 per shirt
4) Zane purchased 2 polo shirts, so the total cost would be:
2 shirts x $30 per shirt = $60
Answer: $60
