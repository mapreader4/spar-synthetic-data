Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The movie theater can hold 50 people at a time.
2) They charge $8.00 per ticket.
3) On Tuesday night, they only sold 24 tickets.
4) To calculate the maximum revenue they could have made, we multiply the total capacity (50) by the ticket price ($8.00):
   50 * $8.00 = $400.00
5) However, they only sold 24 tickets, so the actual revenue they made was:
   24 * $8.00 = $192.00
6) To calculate the money they lost by not selling out, we subtract the actual revenue from the maximum revenue:
   $400.00 - $192.00 = $208.00

Answer: $208
