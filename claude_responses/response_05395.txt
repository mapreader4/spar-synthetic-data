Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The original recipe calls for 2 pounds of pasta and serves 7 people.
2) We need to find how much pasta is needed for 35 people.
3) We can set up a proportion to solve this:
   2 pounds / 7 people = x pounds / 35 people
4) Cross-multiplying, we get:
   2 * 35 = 7x
   70 = 7x
   x = 10 pounds
5) Therefore, Dale needs to buy 10 pounds of pasta for the family reunion.
