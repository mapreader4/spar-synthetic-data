Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The swimming pool holds 84 gallons of water
* Jimmy has a 2 gallon bucket
* It takes 20 seconds to fill the bucket and carry it to the pool to pour in the water
* To calculate the time it will take to fill the pool:
* First, we need to determine how many times Jimmy needs to fill the bucket to fill the pool
* 84 gallons / 2 gallons per bucket = 42 buckets
* Now, we need to calculate the time it takes to fill 42 buckets
* 42 buckets x 20 seconds per bucket = 840 seconds
* 840 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 14 minutes

Answer: 14 minutes
