Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There are 60 pieces of chips in Lara's bag.
2) One-sixth of the chips are blue. To find the number of blue chips, we divide 60 by 6, which gives us 10 blue chips.
3) There are 34 red chips in the bag.
4) To find the number of green chips, we need to subtract the number of blue and red chips from the total number of chips.
5) The total number of chips is 60.
6) The number of blue chips is 10.
7) The number of red chips is 34.
8) So the number of green chips is 60 - 10 - 34 = 16.

Answer: 16
