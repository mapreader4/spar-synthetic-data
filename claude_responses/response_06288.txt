Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alice starts with 27 plates
* She then adds 37 more plates
* So the total number of plates in the tower at this point is 27 + 37 = 64 plates
* The tower then topples over and crashes down, with a total of 83 plates
* To find how many more plates Alice was able to add before the tower fell, we need to subtract the initial 64 plates from the total 83 plates

83 plates - 64 plates = 19 more plates

Answer: 19
