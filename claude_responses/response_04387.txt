Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeff has 16 GB of storage on his phone
* He is already using 4 GB of storage
* So, the remaining storage available is 16 GB - 4 GB = 12 GB
* We know that 1 GB = 1000 MB
* So, 12 GB = 12,000 MB
* Each song takes up 30 MB of storage
* To find the number of songs Jeff can store, we divide the remaining storage (12,000 MB) by the storage per song (30 MB)
* 12,000 MB / 30 MB = 400 songs

Answer: 400
