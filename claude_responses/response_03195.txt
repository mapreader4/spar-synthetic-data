Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James buys 5 packs of sodas, and each pack has 12 sodas.
2) So the total number of sodas he bought is 5 packs x 12 sodas per pack = 60 sodas.
3) He also had 10 sodas already.
4) So the total number of sodas he had is 60 + 10 = 70 sodas.
5) He finishes all the sodas in 1 week.
6) Therefore, the number of sodas he drinks per day is 70 sodas / 7 days = 10 sodas per day.
