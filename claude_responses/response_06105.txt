Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The town council originally intended to plant 7 cherry trees.
2) By the end of the decade, they have planted twice as many cherry trees as they originally planned.
3) Twice as many as 7 is 14 cherry trees.
4) Each tree drops 100 leaves during the fall.
5) To find the total number of leaves that fall, we multiply the number of trees (14) by the number of leaves per tree (100).
6) 14 trees x 100 leaves per tree = 1,400 leaves.

Answer: 1,400
