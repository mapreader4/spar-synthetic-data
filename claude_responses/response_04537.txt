Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miranda saved money for 3 months
* Her sister gave her $50 to buy the heels
* She paid a total of $260 for the heels

To find out how much she saved per month, we need to subtract the $50 her sister gave her from the total cost of $260, and then divide the remaining amount by the number of months she saved (3).

$260 - $50 = $210
$210 / 3 months = $70 per month

Therefore, Miranda saved $70 per month.

Answer: 70
