Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt's protein powder is 80% protein
* Matt weighs 80 kg
* Matt wants to eat 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day
* To calculate the amount of protein Matt needs per day:
    - 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight
    - Matt weighs 80 kg
    - 2 grams per kg x 80 kg = 160 grams of protein per day
* Since the protein powder is 80% protein, we need to calculate how much powder Matt needs to get 160 grams of protein:
    - 160 grams of protein / 0.8 (80% protein) = 200 grams of protein powder per day
* To calculate the amount of protein powder needed per week:
    - 200 grams of protein powder per day x 7 days per week = 1,400 grams of protein powder per week

Answer: 1,400 grams
