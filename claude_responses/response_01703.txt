Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Coach A bought:
* 10 new basketballs at $29 each
* Total cost for basketballs = 10 x $29 = $290

Coach B bought:
* 14 new baseballs at $2.50 each
* Total cost for baseballs = 14 x $2.50 = $35
* 1 baseball bat for $18
* Total cost for Coach B = $35 + $18 = $53

To find the difference in spending between Coach A and Coach B:
* Coach A spent $290
* Coach B spent $53
* Difference in spending = $290 - $53 = $237

Answer: $237
