Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The car has an advertised gas mileage of 35 miles per gallon.
2) The car has a 12-gallon tank.
3) Pria was able to drive a total of 372 miles on a full tank of gas.
4) To calculate Pria's actual mileage, we divide the total miles driven (372) by the tank capacity (12 gallons):
372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon
5) The difference between Pria's mileage and the advertised mileage is:
35 miles per gallon - 31 miles per gallon = 4 miles per gallon
