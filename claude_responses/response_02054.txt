Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Wednesday, the book sold 15 copies
* On Thursday, the book sold three times the number of copies it sold on Wednesday
* To calculate the number of copies sold on Thursday:
  * Copies sold on Wednesday: 15
  * Copies sold on Thursday: 3 x 15 = 45
* On Friday, the book sold one-fifth the number of copies it did on Thursday
* To calculate the number of copies sold on Friday:
  * Copies sold on Thursday: 45
  * Copies sold on Friday: 45 / 5 = 9

Now, to calculate the total number of copies sold by Friday:
* Copies sold on Wednesday: 15
* Copies sold on Thursday: 45
* Copies sold on Friday: 9
* Total copies sold by Friday: 15 + 45 + 9 = 69

Answer: 69
