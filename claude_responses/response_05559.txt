Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lemuel made 2-point shots 7 times.
2) Each 2-point shot is worth 2 points.
3) So, for the 2-point shots, Lemuel scored 7 x 2 = 14 points.
4) Lemuel also made 3-point shots 3 times.
5) Each 3-point shot is worth 3 points.
6) So, for the 3-point shots, Lemuel scored 3 x 3 = 9 points.
7) To find the total points Lemuel scored, we add the points from the 2-point shots and the 3-point shots:
14 points + 9 points = 23 points.

Answer: 23
