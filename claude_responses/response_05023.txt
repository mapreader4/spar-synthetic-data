Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Dark Lord needs to transport 1200 pounds of swords to the Enchanted Forest.
2) He has 10 squads of 8 orcs each, so that's a total of 80 orcs.
3) To calculate how many pounds of swords each orc has to carry, we divide the total weight of the swords (1200 pounds) by the total number of orcs (80).
4) 1200 pounds / 80 orcs = 15 pounds per orc.

Answer: 15
