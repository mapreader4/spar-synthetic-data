Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The total length of the wire is 5 feet 4 inches.
2) We need to convert the length to inches, since the final answer is required in inches.
3) 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 5 feet is equal to 5 * 12 = 60 inches.
4) 4 inches is equal to 4 inches.
5) The total length of the wire in inches is 60 + 4 = 64 inches.
6) The wire was divided into 4 equal parts, so each part must be 64 / 4 = 16 inches.
