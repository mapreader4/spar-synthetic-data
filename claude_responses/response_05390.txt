Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The shop sold a total of 50 cups of milk tea yesterday.
* Two-fifths of the sales are winter melon flavor.
* Three-tenths of the sales are Okinawa flavor.
* The remaining cups are chocolate flavor.

First, let's calculate how many cups are winter melon and Okinawa flavors:
* Winter melon: 2/5 of 50 = 20 cups
* Okinawa: 3/10 of 50 = 15 cups

Now, we can calculate the number of cups that are chocolate flavor:
* Total cups sold = 50
* Winter melon cups = 20
* Okinawa cups = 15
* Chocolate cups = Total cups - Winter melon cups - Okinawa cups
* Chocolate cups = 50 - 20 - 15 = 15 cups

Answer: 15 cups of chocolate-flavored milk tea were sold yesterday.
