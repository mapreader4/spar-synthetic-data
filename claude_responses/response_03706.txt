Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bobby's weekly salary is $450
* Federal taxes remove 1/3 of his salary, which is 1/3 * $450 = $150
* State taxes remove 8% of his salary, which is 0.08 * $450 = $36
* Health insurance removes $50 per week
* Life insurance removes $20 per week
* City parking fee is $10 per week

Now, let's calculate the total deductions:
* Total deductions = Federal taxes ($150) + State taxes ($36) + Health insurance ($50) + Life insurance ($20) + Parking fee ($10)
* Total deductions = $150 + $36 + $50 + $20 + $10 = $266

Finally, we can calculate the final amount left in Bobby's paycheck:
* Final paycheck = Salary ($450) - Total deductions ($266)
* Final paycheck = $450 - $266 = $184

Answer: $184
