Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The ship started with 400 pounds of food supplies.
2) After one day of sailing, 2/5 of the supplies had been used. This means that 2/5 of 400 pounds, or 160 pounds, had been used.
3) The remaining supplies after one day would be 400 pounds - 160 pounds = 240 pounds.
4) After another two days of sailing, 3/5 of the remaining supplies had been used. This means that 3/5 of 240 pounds, or 144 pounds, had been used.
5) The remaining supplies after three days would be 240 pounds - 144 pounds = 96 pounds.

Answer: 96 pounds
