Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Clinton buys a burger meal for $6.00
* He upgrades his fries and drink for an additional $1.00
* So the total cost of his meal is $6.00 + $1.00 = $7.00
* He buys this same meal every day for 5 days
* To calculate the total amount he spends on lunch, we multiply the cost of the meal ($7.00) by the number of days (5)
* $7.00 x 5 = $35.00

Answer: $35
