Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kylie has 34 stamps in her collection
* Nelly has 44 more stamps than Kylie
* To find the number of stamps Nelly has, we add 44 to the number of stamps Kylie has:
* Nelly's stamps = Kylie's stamps + 44
* Nelly's stamps = 34 + 44 = 78
* To find the total number of stamps Kylie and Nelly have together, we add their individual stamp counts:
* Total stamps = Kylie's stamps + Nelly's stamps
* Total stamps = 34 + 78 = 112

Answer: 112
