Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Tom brought 4 six-sided dice
* Each six-sided die has 6 sides
* So, the total number of sides for Tom's 4 dice is:
4 dice x 6 sides per die = 24 sides
* Tim also brought 4 six-sided dice
* The total number of sides for Tim's 4 dice is also:
4 dice x 6 sides per die = 24 sides
* To find the total number of sides, we add the sides for Tom's dice and Tim's dice:
24 sides + 24 sides = 48 sides
Answer: 48
