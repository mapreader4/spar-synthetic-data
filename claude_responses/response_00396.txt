Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Holly needs to take 2 insulin pills per day
* Holly needs to take 3 blood pressure pills per day
* Holly needs to take twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills each day
* So, the number of anticonvulsants per day is 2 x 3 = 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of pills per day:
* Insulin pills per day: 2
* Blood pressure pills per day: 3
* Anticonvulsants per day: 6
* Total pills per day: 2 + 3 + 6 = 11

Finally, to calculate the total number of pills in a week:
* Total pills per day: 11
* Total days in a week: 7
* Total pills in a week: 11 x 7 = 77

Answer: 77
