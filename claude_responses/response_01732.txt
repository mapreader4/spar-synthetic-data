Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each carton of ice cream contains 10 scoops
* Mary has 3 cartons: 1 chocolate, 1 strawberry, and 1 vanilla
* Ethan wants 1 scoop of vanilla and 1 scoop of chocolate
* Lucas, Danny, and Connor each want 2 scoops of chocolate
* Olivia wants 1 scoop of vanilla and 1 scoop of strawberry
* Shannon wants twice as much as Olivia, which is 2 scoops of vanilla and 2 scoops of strawberry

Now, let's calculate the total number of scoops used:
* Ethan uses 1 vanilla and 1 chocolate = 2 scoops
* Lucas, Danny, and Connor each use 2 chocolate scoops, so 3 x 2 = 6 scoops
* Olivia uses 1 vanilla and 1 strawberry = 2 scoops
* Shannon uses 2 vanilla and 2 strawberry = 4 scoops

The total scoops used is 2 + 6 + 2 + 4 = 14 scoops.

Each carton has 10 scoops, so 3 cartons have 30 scoops total.
The number of scoops left is 30 - 14 = 16 scoops.
