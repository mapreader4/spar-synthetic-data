Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The lake is 5 miles long
* Marcos needs to get across the lake in 10 minutes
* To find the speed he needs to travel, we can use the formula:
Speed = Distance / Time
* Plugging in the values:
Speed = 5 miles / (10 minutes / 60 minutes per hour)
* Simplifying:
Speed = 5 miles / (1/6 hours)
* Solving for speed:
Speed = 5 miles * 6 hours/1 hour
* Therefore, the speed Marcos needs to travel is:
Answer: 30 miles per hour
