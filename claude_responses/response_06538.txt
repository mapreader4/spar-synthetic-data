Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The total length of the path is 900 feet.
2) A fence pole is placed every 6 feet along the path.
3) The entire path is lined with a fence, except for a 42-foot bridge.
4) To find the number of fence poles, we need to subtract the length of the bridge (42 feet) from the total length of the path (900 feet).
5) 900 feet - 42 feet = 858 feet.
6) Since a fence pole is placed every 6 feet, we divide the remaining length (858 feet) by 6 to find the number of fence poles.
7) 858 feet / 6 feet per pole = 143 poles.
8) Since the fence is placed on both sides of the path, we need to double the number of poles.
9) 143 poles x 2 = 286 poles.

Answer: 286
