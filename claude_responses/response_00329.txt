Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts, which is 2 x 12 = 24 doughnuts.
2) Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts, which is 3 x 12 = 36 doughnuts.
3) The total number of doughnuts is 24 + 36 = 60 doughnuts.
4) They planned to share the doughnuts evenly with their 8 other friends, which means there are 10 people total (Samuel, Cathy, and 8 friends).
5) To find how many doughnuts each person will receive, we divide the total number of doughnuts (60) by the number of people (10).
6) 60 รท 10 = 6 doughnuts per person.
