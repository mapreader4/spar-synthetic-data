Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Tuesday, Max's mom gave him $8 for a hot dog.

2. On Wednesday, his mom gave him 5 times as much money as she gave him on Tuesday.
   * Tuesday's amount: $8
   * Wednesday's amount: 5 x $8 = $40

3. On Thursday, his mom gave him $9 more in money than she gave him on Wednesday.
   * Wednesday's amount: $40
   * Thursday's amount: $40 + $9 = $49

4. To find how much more money his mom gave him on Thursday than she gave him on Tuesday, we subtract the Tuesday amount from the Thursday amount:
   * Thursday amount: $49
   * Tuesday amount: $8
   * Difference: $49 - $8 = $41

Answer: $41
