Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Elisa paints 30 square feet of her house's walls.
2. On Tuesday, she paints twice the amount she painted on Monday, which is 2 x 30 = 60 square feet.
3. On Wednesday, she paints half as many square feet as she painted on Monday, which is 1/2 x 30 = 15 square feet.

Now, to find the total square feet Elisa painted in her house, we add up the amounts from each day:
30 + 60 + 15 = 105 square feet

Answer: 105
