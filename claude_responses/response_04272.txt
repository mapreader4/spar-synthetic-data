Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recipe is for 12 servings of Chicken Surprise
* The recipe requires 4.5 pounds of chicken
* The recipe requires 24 ounces of stuffing
* To find the ounces per serving, we need to convert the total amounts to ounces and then divide by the number of servings

First, let's convert the 4.5 pounds of chicken to ounces:
* 1 pound = 16 ounces
* 4.5 pounds = 4.5 * 16 = 72 ounces of chicken

Now, we have:
* 72 ounces of chicken
* 24 ounces of stuffing
* 12 servings

To find the ounces per serving, we add the total ounces of chicken and stuffing, and divide by the number of servings:
* Total ounces = 72 + 24 = 96 ounces
* Ounces per serving = 96 ounces / 12 servings = 8 ounces per serving

Answer: 8 ounces
