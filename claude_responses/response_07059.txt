Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maddie bought 3 makeup palettes at $15 each
* So the total cost of the makeup palettes is 3 x $15 = $45
* Maddie also bought 4 lipsticks at $2.50 each
* So the total cost of the lipsticks is 4 x $2.50 = $10
* Maddie also bought 3 boxes of hair color at $4 each
* So the total cost of the hair color is 3 x $4 = $12
* To calculate the total amount Maddie paid, we add up the costs of the makeup palettes, lipsticks, and hair color:
* $45 + $10 + $12 = $67

Answer: 67
