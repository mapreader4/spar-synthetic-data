Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Arthur has 3 dogs
* The dogs eat an average of 15 pounds of food a week
* One dog eats 13 pounds a week
* The second dog eats double the first dog's amount, which is 2 * 13 = 26 pounds a week

Now, we need to find out how much the third dog eats a week. We know the total amount of food the 3 dogs eat is 15 pounds per week. We also know the first dog eats 13 pounds and the second dog eats 26 pounds.

To find the amount the third dog eats, we can subtract the amounts of the first two dogs from the total:
* Total food eaten = 15 pounds
* Food eaten by first dog = 13 pounds
* Food eaten by second dog = 26 pounds
* Food eaten by third dog = 15 - 13 - 26 = -24 pounds

However, this doesn't make sense, as a dog cannot eat a negative amount of food. 

Let's double check our work:
* Total food eaten = 15 pounds
* Food eaten by first dog = 13 pounds 
* Food eaten by second dog = 26 pounds
* Food eaten by third dog = 15 - 13 - 26 = -24 pounds (this is not possible)

Therefore, the amount the third dog eats per week is:
Answer: 15 - 13 - 26 = -24 pounds (which is not possible)
