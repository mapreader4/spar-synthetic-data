Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The problem states that there are twice as many sharks as stingrays.
2) The problem also states that there are 28 stingrays.
3) Since there are twice as many sharks as stingrays, we can calculate the number of sharks by multiplying the number of stingrays by 2.
4) 28 stingrays x 2 = 56 sharks.
5) The total number of fish is the sum of the number of sharks and the number of stingrays.
6) 56 sharks + 28 stingrays = 84 fish.

Answer: 84
