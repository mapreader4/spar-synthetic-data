Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John gives his dog 2 treats per day
* The cost of each treat is $0.10
* The month is 30 days long

To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of treats John's dog will eat in 30 days:
   * 2 treats per day x 30 days = 60 treats

2. Calculate the total cost of the 60 treats:
   * 60 treats x $0.10 per treat = $6.00

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 6
