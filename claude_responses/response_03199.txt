Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each sonnet is 14 lines long
* Horatio's lady fair told him to leave after he read her 7 sonnets
* The 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard were the remaining lines from the sonnets he had written

To find the total number of sonnets Horatio wrote, we need to calculate the total number of lines he wrote and then divide that by the number of lines per sonnet.

The total number of lines he wrote is:
* 7 sonnets read + 70 lines unread = 7 * 14 + 70 = 148 lines

Now, we divide the total number of lines by the number of lines per sonnet to get the total number of sonnets:
* 148 lines / 14 lines per sonnet = 10.57 sonnets

Since we can't have a fractional number of sonnets, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 11 sonnets
