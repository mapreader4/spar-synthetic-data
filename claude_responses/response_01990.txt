Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first car was made in 1970
* The second car was made 10 years later than the first car
* So the second car was made in 1970 + 10 = 1980
* The third car was made 20 years later than the second car
* So the third car was made in 1980 + 20 = 2000

Answer: 2000
