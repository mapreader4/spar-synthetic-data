Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 5 pieces of hamburger at $3 each: 5 x $3 = $15
* 4 sets of French fries at $1.20 each: 4 x $1.20 = $4.80
* 5 cups of soda at $0.5 each: 5 x $0.5 = $2.50
* 1 platter of spaghetti at $2.7: $2.70

Now, we add up the total cost of the meal:
* $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25

Since there are 5 friends, they will split the bill equally. To calculate the amount each of them will pay, we divide the total cost by 5:
* $25 / 5 = $5

Answer: 5
