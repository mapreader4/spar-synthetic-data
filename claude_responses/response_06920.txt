Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The person puts $5600 in the bank for two years.
2) Each year, he earns interest of 7% of the original amount deposited.
3) To calculate the interest earned in the first year:
   * Interest = 7% of $5600 = 0.07 x $5600 = $392
4) The total amount in the bank after the first year is:
   * $5600 + $392 = $5992
5) To calculate the interest earned in the second year:
   * Interest = 7% of $5992 = 0.07 x $5992 = $419.44
6) The total amount in the bank after the second year is:
   * $5992 + $419.44 = $6411.44

Answer: $6411
