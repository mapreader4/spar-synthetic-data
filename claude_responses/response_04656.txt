Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary bought 14 apples
* Mary bought 9 oranges
* Mary bought 6 blueberries
* Mary ate 1 of each type of fruit
* So, Mary ate 1 apple, 1 orange, and 1 blueberry
* To calculate the total number of fruits Mary has left, we need to subtract the number of fruits she ate from the total number of fruits she bought:
* Total fruits bought: 14 apples + 9 oranges + 6 blueberries = 29 fruits
* Fruits eaten: 1 apple + 1 orange + 1 blueberry = 3 fruits
* Fruits left: 29 fruits - 3 fruits = 26 fruits

Answer: 26
