Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 30 students in the classroom.
2) 1/3 of the students are boys, so the number of boys is 30 * 1/3 = 10 boys.
3) The number of girls is the total number of students (30) minus the number of boys (10), which is 20 girls.
4) Among the girls, 40% own dogs. 40% of 20 girls is 0.4 * 20 = 8 girls own dogs.
5) Among the girls, 20% own cats. 20% of 20 girls is 0.2 * 20 = 4 girls own cats.
6) The remaining girls are those who do not own any pets. The number of girls with no pets is the total number of girls (20) minus the number of girls who own dogs (8) and the number of girls who own cats (4), which is 20 - 8 - 4 = 8 girls.
