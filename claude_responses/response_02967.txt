Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dave weighs 175 pounds
2) Dave can bench press three times his body weight, which is 3 * 175 = 525 pounds
3) Craig can only bench press 20% of the amount Dave can, which is 20% of 525 pounds = 0.2 * 525 = 105 pounds
4) Mark can bench press 50 pounds less than Craig, which is 105 - 50 = 55 pounds

Answer: 55 pounds
