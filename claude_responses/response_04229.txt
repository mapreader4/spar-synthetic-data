Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nate starts with 70 matches.
2) He drops 10 matches in a creek.
3) His dog eats twice as many matches as he dropped in the creek. 
   * He dropped 10 matches, so his dog eats 2 x 10 = 20 matches.
4) To calculate the number of matches Nate has left, we start with the original 70 matches, then subtract the 10 he dropped and the 20 his dog ate.
   * 70 - 10 - 20 = 40 matches.

Answer: 40
