Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Last year's costume cost $250.
2) This year's costume is 40% more expensive than last year's. To calculate the new cost:
   * 40% of $250 = 0.4 * $250 = $100
   * New cost = $250 + $100 = $350
3) Jeff has to put in a 10% deposit. The deposit is 10% of $350, which is 0.1 * $350 = $35.
4) The remaining amount to pay when picking up the costume is the total cost ($350) minus the deposit ($35).
   * Remaining amount = $350 - $35 = $315.

Answer: $315.
