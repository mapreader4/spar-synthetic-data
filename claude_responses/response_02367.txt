Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The chef prepared 17 meals for lunch.
2) During lunch, he sold 12 meals.
3) This means he has 17 - 12 = 5 meals remaining from lunch.
4) After lunch, the chef prepared another 5 meals for dinner.
5) So the total number of meals the chef has for dinner is the 5 remaining from lunch, plus the 5 he prepared for dinner, which is 5 + 5 = 10 meals.
