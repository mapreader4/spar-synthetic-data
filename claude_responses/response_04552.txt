Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Monica takes 10 subjects
* Marius takes 4 more subjects than Monica, so Marius takes 10 + 4 = 14 subjects
* Millie takes 3 more subjects than Marius, so Millie takes 14 + 3 = 17 subjects

Now, to find the total number of subjects taken by all three:
* Monica takes 10 subjects
* Marius takes 14 subjects
* Millie takes 17 subjects
* Total subjects taken = 10 + 14 + 17 = 41

Answer: 41
