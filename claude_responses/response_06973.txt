Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The water tank has a capacity of 4000 gallons.
2) Mack connects a pipe that fills the tank at a rate of 10 gallons per hour.
3) We need to find how long it will take to fill the tank to 3/4 of its capacity.
4) 3/4 of the tank's capacity is 3/4 * 4000 = 3000 gallons.
5) To find the time it takes to fill the tank to 3000 gallons, we divide 3000 gallons by the fill rate of 10 gallons per hour.
6) 3000 gallons / 10 gallons per hour = 300 hours.

Answer: 300
