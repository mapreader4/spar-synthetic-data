Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hot dog buns come in packages of 8.
2) Mr. Gates bought 30 packages of hot dog buns.
3) Each package has 8 hot dog buns, so the total number of hot dog buns is:
   30 packages x 8 buns per package = 240 hot dog buns
4) Mr. Gates has 4 classes with 30 students in each class.
5) The total number of students is 4 classes x 30 students per class = 120 students.
6) To calculate how many hot dog buns each student can get, we divide the total number of hot dog buns (240) by the total number of students (120):
   240 hot dog buns / 120 students = 2 hot dog buns per student.
