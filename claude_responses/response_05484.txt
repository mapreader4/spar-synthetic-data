Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles. This means that the number of blue marbles is equal to the number of red marbles plus 24.
2) We also know that Brett has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles. This means that the number of blue marbles is 5 times the number of red marbles.
3) Let's call the number of red marbles 'x'. Then the number of blue marbles is 5x.
4) We know that the number of blue marbles is equal to the number of red marbles plus 24. So 5x = x + 24.
5) Solving for x, we get 4x = 24, so x = 6.
Answer: 6
