Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Each batch of cookies contains 12 cookies.
2. Kendra made 3 batches of cookies.
3. So the total number of cookies baked is 3 batches x 12 cookies per batch = 36 cookies.
4. There are 4 people in Kendra's family.
5. If each family member gets the same number of cookies, then each person would get 36 cookies / 4 people = 9 cookies.
6. Each cookie contains 2 chocolate chips.
7. So each family member would eat 9 cookies x 2 chocolate chips per cookie = 18 chocolate chips.

Answer: 18
