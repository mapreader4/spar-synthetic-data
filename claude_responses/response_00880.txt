Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes every day
* There are 7 days in a week
* We need to find the total time spent jogging after two weeks
* First, let's calculate the time spent jogging in one week:
  * 1 hour 30 minutes per day
  * 7 days in a week
  * 1 hour 30 minutes x 7 days = 10 hours 30 minutes
* Now, to find the time spent jogging after two weeks:
  * 10 hours 30 minutes x 2 weeks = 21 hours

Answer: 21 hours
