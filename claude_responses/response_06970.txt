Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joel collected 18 stuffed animals, 42 action figures, 2 board games, and 13 puzzles from his friends
* This adds up to 18 + 42 + 2 + 13 = 75 toys from his friends
* His sister gave him some toys from her closet
* Joel then added twice as many toys from his own closet as his sister did from hers
* In total, Joel was able to donate 108 toys
* To find how many of the donated toys were Joel's, we need to subtract the 75 toys from his friends from the total of 108 toys
* 108 - 75 = 33 toys that were Joel's

Answer: 33
