Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Robin ate 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce
* She also ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting
* To find the number of cupcakes with buttercream frosting, we multiply the 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce by 2:
* 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce x 2 = 8 cupcakes with buttercream frosting
* Now, to find the total number of cupcakes Robin ate, we add the 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce and the 8 cupcakes with buttercream frosting:
* 4 + 8 = 12 cupcakes

Answer: 12 cupcakes
