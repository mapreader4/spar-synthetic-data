Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ralph starts with 175 tennis balls in the machine.
2) Out of the first 100 balls, he hits 2/5 of them.
   * 2/5 of 100 = 40 balls hit
   * Remaining balls not hit = 100 - 40 = 60 balls
3) Out of the next 75 balls, he hits 1/3 of them.
   * 1/3 of 75 = 25 balls hit
   * Remaining balls not hit = 75 - 25 = 50 balls
4) In total, the number of balls Ralph did not hit is:
   * Balls not hit from first 100 = 60
   * Balls not hit from next 75 = 50
   * Total balls not hit = 60 + 50 = 110

Answer: 110
