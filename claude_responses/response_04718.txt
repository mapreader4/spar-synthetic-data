Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James writes from 1 PM to 4 PM every night, which is a total of 3 hours per day.
2) He can write 5 pages per hour.
3) So in 3 hours per day, he can write 5 pages x 3 hours = 15 pages per day.
4) The book is 735 pages long.
5) To find how many days it will take to write the 735 pages, we divide 735 by 15 pages per day:
735 pages / 15 pages per day = 49 days.
6) There are 7 days in a week, so to find how many weeks it will take, we divide 49 days by 7 days per week:
49 days / 7 days per week = 7 weeks.

Answer: 7 weeks.
