Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The ticket price for adults is $26
* The ticket price for children is half of the adult price, which is $13
* There were 183 adults who attended the show
* There were 28 children who attended the show
* To calculate the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of tickets sold for each group by the respective ticket prices, and then add them together.

For the adults:
* 183 adults x $26 per ticket = $4,758

For the children:
* 28 children x $13 per ticket = $364

Now, we add the revenue from the adults and the children to get the total revenue:
* $4,758 + $364 = $5,122

Answer: $5,122
