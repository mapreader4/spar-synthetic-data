Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater.
   Let's represent the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater as 'x'.
   Then, the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the refrigerator is 3x.

2. The electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, which is twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses.
   So, the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater is $500 / 2 = $250.
   This means that 'x' = $250.

3. Now, we can calculate the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets:
   - Power used by the water heater: $250
   - Power used by the refrigerator: 3 x $250 = $750
   - Power used by the electric oven: $500

   Total amount paid = $250 + $750 + $500 = $1,500

Answer: $1,500
