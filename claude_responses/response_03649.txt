Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Uncle Ben has 440 chickens on his farm
* 39 of them are roosters
* The remaining 440 - 39 = 401 chickens are hens
* 15 of the hens do not lay eggs
* The remaining 401 - 15 = 386 hens do lay eggs
* Each egg-laying hen lays 3 eggs
* Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by the 386 egg-laying hens is 386 * 3 = 1,158 eggs

Answer: 1,158
