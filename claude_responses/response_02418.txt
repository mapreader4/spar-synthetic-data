Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lyra has a weekly food budget of $80
* She bought:
  - 1 bucket of fried chicken that costs $12
  - 5 pounds of beef that cost $3 per pound
* To calculate the cost of the beef:
  - 5 pounds of beef at $3 per pound = 5 x $3 = $15
* So the total amount Lyra spent is:
  - Fried chicken: $12
  - Beef: $15
  - Total: $12 + $15 = $27
* Now, to calculate how much is left on her weekly budget:
  - Lyra's weekly budget: $80
  - Amount spent: $27
  - Amount left: $80 - $27 = $53

Answer: $53
