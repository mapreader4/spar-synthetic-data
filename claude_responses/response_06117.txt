Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cape May and Daytona Beach have a total of 40 shark sightings per year
* Cape May has 8 less than double the number of shark sightings of Daytona Beach
* Let's call the number of shark sightings in Daytona Beach as x
* Then, the number of shark sightings in Cape May is 2x - 8
* The total number of shark sightings is 40, so we can set up the equation:
x + (2x - 8) = 40
* Solving for x, we get:
3x - 8 = 40
3x = 48
x = 16
* Therefore, the number of shark sightings in Daytona Beach is 16
* And the number of shark sightings in Cape May is 2x - 8 = 2(16) - 8 = 24
