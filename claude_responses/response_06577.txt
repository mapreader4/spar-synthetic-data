Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jimmy needs to score at least 50 points to pass to the next class.
* He earned 20 points for each of the 3 exams he wrote, which is 3 x 20 = 60 points.
* He lost 5 points during the school year for bad behavior.
* So, his total points so far are 60 - 5 = 55 points.
* Since he needs at least 50 points to pass, he can afford to lose up to 55 - 50 = 5 more points and still be able to pass the next class.
