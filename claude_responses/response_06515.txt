Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total cost per night per person is $40
* Jenny and two of her friends stayed at the hotel
* They stayed for 3 nights

To calculate the total amount of money they all paid together, we need to:
1. Multiply the cost per night per person ($40) by the number of people (3)
2. Multiply the result from step 1 by the number of nights (3)

Step 1: 
* Cost per night per person = $40
* Number of people = 3
* $40 x 3 = $120

Step 2:
* Number of nights = 3
* $120 x 3 = $360

Answer: $360
