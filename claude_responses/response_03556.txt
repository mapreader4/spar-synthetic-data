Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kathleen saved $21 in June, $46 in July, and $45 in August.
2) So the total amount Kathleen saved is $21 + $46 + $45 = $112.
3) Kathleen then spent $12 on school supplies and $54 on new clothes.
4) The total amount Kathleen spent is $12 + $54 = $66.
5) To calculate the amount of money Kathleen has left, we take the total amount she saved ($112) and subtract the total amount she spent ($66).
6) $112 - $66 = $46.
7) Kathleen's aunt said she would give Kathleen $25 if Kathleen saves more than $125.
8) Since Kathleen saved $112, which is less than $125, she does not qualify for the $25 from her aunt.
9) Therefore, the total amount of money Kathleen has left is $46.

Answer: 46
