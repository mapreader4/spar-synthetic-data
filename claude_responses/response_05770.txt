Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark supplies one store with 5 dozen eggs each day
* 1 dozen = 12 eggs
* So, 5 dozen eggs = 5 x 12 = 60 eggs per day to the first store
* Mark also supplies another store with 30 eggs each day
* In a week, there are 7 days
* For the first store:
  - 60 eggs per day x 7 days = 420 eggs per week
* For the second store:
  - 30 eggs per day x 7 days = 210 eggs per week
* To find the total number of eggs supplied to both stores in a week:
  - 420 eggs + 210 eggs = 630 eggs

Answer: 630
