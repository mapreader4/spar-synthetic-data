Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The distance between Arizona and New York is around 2,000 miles by plane.
2) If someone decides to drive instead of flying, the distance increases by 40%.
3) To calculate the driving distance, we take the plane distance and increase it by 40%:
   2,000 miles x 1.4 = 2,800 miles
4) Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York.
5) To find the distance from Missouri to New York, we take the total driving distance (2,800 miles) and divide it by 2, since Missouri is midway:
   2,800 miles / 2 = 1,400 miles

Answer: 1,400 miles
