Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. This means that if the number of dogs is x, then the number of cats is 0.8x.
2) There are twice as many frogs as the number of dogs. This means that if the number of dogs is x, then the number of frogs is 2x.
3) We are told that there are 160 frogs. So, 2x = 160, which means x = 80.
4) If the number of dogs is 80, then the number of cats is 0.8 * 80 = 64.
5) The total number of animals is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and frogs.
6) The total number of animals = 80 dogs + 64 cats + 160 frogs = 304.

Answer: 304
