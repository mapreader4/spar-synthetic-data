Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The total price of the meal is $67.
2) They have a coupon for $4, so the final price of the meal is $67 - $4 = $63.
3) There are 3 people splitting the bill evenly, so each person needs to contribute 1/3 of the final price.
4) 1/3 of $63 is $63 / 3 = $21.

Answer: $21
