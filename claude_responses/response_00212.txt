Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Randy is 12 years old and wants to become a piano expert before he is 20 years old
* The 10,000-hour rule says that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in a field
* We need to calculate how many hours per day Randy needs to practice to reach 10,000 hours before he turns 20
* There are 8 years between when Randy is 12 and when he turns 20
* In a year, there are 52 weeks, and Randy takes 2 weeks off for vacation
* So, in a year, Randy has 50 weeks of practice time (52 weeks - 2 weeks vacation)
* Each week, Randy practices Monday through Friday, which is 5 days per week
* So, in a year, Randy has 50 weeks x 5 days/week = 250 days of practice
* To reach 10,000 hours in 8 years, Randy needs to practice 10,000 hours / 8 years = 1,250 hours per year
* 1,250 hours per year / 250 days of practice per year = 5 hours per day

Answer: 5 hours
