Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Know It All High School had 50 students at the competition.

2. Karen High had 3/5 times as many students as Know It All High School. 
   * 3/5 of 50 = 30 students from Karen High.

3. The combined number of students from Know It All High School and Karen High was 50 + 30 = 80 students.

4. Novel Corona High School had twice the combined number of students from the first two schools.
   * Twice the combined number of 80 students is 160 students from Novel Corona High School.

Now, to calculate the total number of students at the competition, we add up the students from all three schools:
* 50 + 30 + 160 = 240 students

Answer: 240
