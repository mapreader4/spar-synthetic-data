Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Jill has 9 llamas that got pregnant with 1 calf each, so that's 9 additional calves
* Jill has 5 llamas that got pregnant with twins, so that's 10 additional calves
* In total, Jill has 9 + 10 = 19 calves
* Jill then trades 8 of the calves for 2 new adult llamas
* So now Jill has 19 - 8 = 11 calves, and 2 new adult llamas
* Jill then sells 1/3 of her herd at the market
* Before the sale, Jill had the original number of adult llamas, plus the 2 new ones, which is 9 + 2 = 11 adult llamas
* 1/3 of 11 adult llamas is 11/3 = 3.67 adult llamas sold
* So Jill has 11 - 3 = 8 adult llamas left
* Jill also has 11 calves left
* Therefore, the total number of llamas (calves and adults) that Jill has now is 8 + 11 = 19

Answer: 19
