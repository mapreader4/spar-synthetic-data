Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alex already has $14,500 saved up
* The car costs $14,600
* He needs to make up the remaining $100 ($14,600 - $14,500)
* He charges $1.5 per trip and 5% of the price of the groceries
* He makes 40 trips

To calculate the amount of groceries he needs to deliver, we first need to find out how much he earns per trip:
* $1.5 per trip + 5% of the price of the groceries

We know that he needs to make $100 to cover the remaining cost of the car, so we can set up an equation:
* 40 trips x ($1.5 + 5% of the price of the groceries) = $100

Solving for the price of the groceries:
* 40 x ($1.5 + 0.05 x price of groceries) = $100
* 60 + 2 x price of groceries = $100
* 2 x price of groceries = $40
* Price of groceries = $20

Therefore, Alex delivered $20 worth of groceries.

Answer: $20
