Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Gary has 30 grams of gold that cost $15 per gram.
   * To find the total cost of Gary's gold, we multiply the amount of gold by the cost per gram:
   * 30 grams x $15 per gram = $450

2. Anna has 50 grams of gold that cost $20 per gram.
   * To find the total cost of Anna's gold, we multiply the amount of gold by the cost per gram:
   * 50 grams x $20 per gram = $1,000

3. To find the combined cost of their gold, we add the total cost of Gary's gold and Anna's gold:
   * $450 + $1,000 = $1,450

Answer: $1,450
