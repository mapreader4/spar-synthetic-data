Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elvis is releasing a new album with 10 songs
* He spends 5 hours in the studio
* Each song takes 12 minutes to record
* It takes 30 minutes to edit all of his songs

First, we need to calculate the total time spent recording the songs:
* 10 songs x 12 minutes per song = 120 minutes

Next, we need to add the time spent editing the songs:
* 30 minutes

So the total time spent in the studio is:
* 120 minutes + 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how much time was spent writing the songs. We know that Elvis spent 5 hours (300 minutes) in the studio, so:
* 300 minutes - 150 minutes = 150 minutes

Since there are 10 songs, and the total time spent writing was 150 minutes, we can divide to find the time spent writing each song:
* 150 minutes / 10 songs = 15 minutes per song

Answer: 15 minutes
