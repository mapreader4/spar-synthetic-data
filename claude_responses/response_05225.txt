Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bruno wants to buy two and one-half dozens of pens
* One dozen is equal to 12 pens
* Two and one-half dozens is equal to 2.5 dozens
* To calculate the total number of pens, we multiply 2.5 dozens by 12 pens per dozen:
* 2.5 dozens x 12 pens/dozen = 30 pens

Answer: 30
