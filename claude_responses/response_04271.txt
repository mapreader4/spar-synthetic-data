Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dante takes 15 minutes to go to Hidden Lake
* From Hidden Lake, he has to walk back to the Park Office, and this takes him 7 minutes
* In total, he has been gone from the Park Office for 32 minutes

Now, we need to find the time it takes him to walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant.

We know that:
* Total time gone from Park Office = 32 minutes
* Time to go to Hidden Lake = 15 minutes
* Time to return from Hidden Lake = 7 minutes

Therefore, the time spent walking from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant must be:
* 32 minutes - 15 minutes - 7 minutes = 10 minutes

Answer: 10 minutes
