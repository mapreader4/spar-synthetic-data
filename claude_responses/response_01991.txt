Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sally already has $28 saved.
2) The costs for the trip are:
   - $10 for parking
   - $55 for park admission
   - $25 for a meal pass
3) The total cost of the trip so far is:
   - $10 + $55 + $25 = $90
4) The distance to Sea World is 165 miles.
5) Sally's car gets 30 miles per gallon of gas.
6) Gas costs $3 per gallon.
7) To calculate the cost of gas, we first need to find how many gallons of gas she will need:
   - 165 miles / 30 miles per gallon = 5.5 gallons
8) The cost of gas will be:
   - 5.5 gallons x $3 per gallon = $16.50
9) The total cost of the trip is:
   - $90 + $16.50 = $106.50
10) Since Sally already has $28 saved, the amount she still needs to save is:
    - $106.50 - $28 = $78.50

Answer: $78
