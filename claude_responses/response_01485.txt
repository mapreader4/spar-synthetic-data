Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Adam has a total of 50 balls
* 20 of the balls are red
* 10 of the balls are blue
* The remaining balls are either pink or orange
* There are 3 times as many pink balls as orange balls

First, let's find the number of balls that are not red or blue:
* Total balls = 50
* Red balls = 20
* Blue balls = 10
* Balls that are not red or blue = 50 - 20 - 10 = 20

Now, we know that there are 3 times as many pink balls as orange balls. Let's call the number of orange balls 'x'.
* Pink balls = 3x

We also know that the total number of non-red and non-blue balls is 20.
* Pink balls + Orange balls = 20
* 3x + x = 20
* 4x = 20
* x = 5

Therefore, the number of orange balls is 5.

Answer: 5
