Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emily purchased 2 pairs of curtains at $30.00 each
* So the total cost of the curtains is 2 x $30.00 = $60.00
* Emily also purchased 9 wall prints at $15.00 each
* So the total cost of the wall prints is 9 x $15.00 = $135.00
* The store offers an installation service for $50.00
* To calculate the total cost of Emily's entire order, we add the cost of the curtains, the wall prints, and the installation service:
* $60.00 + $135.00 + $50.00 = $245.00

Answer: $245
