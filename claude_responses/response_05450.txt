Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 kettles of hawks being tracked
* Each kettle has an average of 15 pregnancies
* Each pregnancy yields 4 babies per batch
* So, the total number of babies expected is:
  - 6 kettles x 15 pregnancies per kettle x 4 babies per batch = 360 babies
* However, the question states that approximately 25% of the babies are expected to be lost
* To calculate the number of babies lost, we take 25% of the total number of babies:
  - 0.25 x 360 = 90 babies lost
* To calculate the final number of babies expected, we subtract the number of babies lost from the total number of babies:
  - 360 - 90 = 270 babies

Answer: 270
