Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The previous largest spider weighed 6.4 ounces.
2) The new giant spider weighs 2.5 times the previous largest spider, so its weight is:
   2.5 x 6.4 ounces = 16 ounces
3) Each of the giant spider's legs has a cross-sectional area of 0.5 square inches.
4) To calculate the pressure on each leg, we divide the weight of the spider by the total cross-sectional area of all the legs:
   Weight of spider: 16 ounces
   Total cross-sectional area of all legs: 8 x 0.5 square inches = 4 square inches
   Pressure on each leg = 16 ounces / 4 square inches = 4 ounces per square inch

Answer: 4 ounces per square inch
