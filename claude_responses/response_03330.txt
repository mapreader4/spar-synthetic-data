Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jane bought 62 red pens and 43 black pens for each of her 3 students.
2) So the total number of pens bought is:
   * 3 students x (62 red + 43 black) = 3 x 105 = 315 pens
3) After the first month, 37 pens were taken from the pool.
4) After the second month, another 41 pens were taken from the pool.
5) So the total number of pens taken from the pool is 37 + 41 = 78 pens.
6) The remaining number of pens in the pool is 315 - 78 = 237 pens.
7) Jane decided to split the remaining 237 pens equally among her 3 students.
8) So each student will get 237 / 3 = 79 pens.

Answer: 79
