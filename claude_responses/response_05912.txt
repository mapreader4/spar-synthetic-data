Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Selene's purchase:
* 3 sandwiches at $2 each = 3 x $2 = $6
* 1 can of fruit juice at $2 each = 1 x $2 = $2
* Total for Selene = $6 + $2 = $8

Tanya's purchase:
* 2 hamburgers at $2 each = 2 x $2 = $4
* 2 cans of fruit juice at $2 each = 2 x $2 = $4
* Total for Tanya = $4 + $4 = $8

Now, to find the total amount Selene and Tanya spend together, we add their individual totals:
* Total spent by Selene and Tanya = $8 + $8 = $16

Answer: $16
