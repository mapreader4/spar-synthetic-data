Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs.
2) Each roof has two slanted rectangular sides, each measuring 20 feet by 40 feet.
3) To find the total area of one roof, we need to calculate the area of each side and then add them together.
4) The area of one side is 20 feet x 40 feet = 800 square feet.
5) Since there are two sides, the total area of one roof is 800 square feet + 800 square feet = 1,600 square feet.
6) Since Jerry needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, we can calculate the total number of shingles needed for one roof by multiplying 1,600 square feet by 8 shingles per square foot.
7) 1,600 square feet x 8 shingles per square foot = 12,800 shingles per roof.
8) Since Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs, the total number of shingles needed is 12,800 shingles per roof x 3 roofs = 38,400 shingles.

Answer: 38,400
