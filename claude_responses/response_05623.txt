Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The class has 30 students
* 1/5 of the students like Math
* 1/3 of the students like English
* 1/7 of the remaining students like Science
* The rest don't have a favorite subject

First, let's calculate how many students like Math:
* 1/5 of 30 students = 30 * 1/5 = 6 students

Next, let's calculate how many students like English:
* 1/3 of 30 students = 30 * 1/3 = 10 students

Now, let's calculate how many students are left after the Math and English students are accounted for:
* 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 students

Finally, let's calculate how many of the remaining 14 students like Science:
* 1/7 of 14 students = 14 * 1/7 = 2 students

The remaining students are the ones who don't have a favorite subject:
* 14 - 2 = 12 students

Answer: 12
