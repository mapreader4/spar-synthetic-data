Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ms. Swanson's class has an average of 5 zits per student.
2) There are 25 kids in Ms. Swanson's class.
3) To find the total number of zits in Ms. Swanson's class, we multiply the average (5) by the number of students (25):
5 zits per student x 25 students = 125 total zits in Ms. Swanson's class.

4) Mr. Jones' class has an average of 6 zits per student. 
5) There are 32 kids in Mr. Jones' class.
6) To find the total number of zits in Mr. Jones' class, we multiply the average (6) by the number of students (32):
6 zits per student x 32 students = 192 total zits in Mr. Jones' class.

7) To find the difference in zits between the two classes, we subtract the total zits in Ms. Swanson's class from the total zits in Mr. Jones' class:
192 total zits in Mr. Jones' class - 125 total zits in Ms. Swanson's class = 67 more zits in Mr. Jones' class.

Answer: 67
