Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The plot of land in front of Jill's house is 200 feet wide by 50 feet deep.
* The total area of the plot is 200 feet x 50 feet = 10,000 square feet.
* The sidewalk is 3 feet wide and 50 feet long, so the area of the sidewalk is 3 feet x 50 feet = 150 square feet.
* The two flower beds in front of the house are each 4 feet deep by 25 feet long, so the total area of those two beds is 2 x (4 feet x 25 feet) = 200 square feet.
* The third flower bed is 10 feet by 12 feet, so the area of that bed is 10 feet x 12 feet = 120 square feet.
* The fourth flower bed is 7 feet by 8 feet, so the area of that bed is 7 feet x 8 feet = 56 square feet.
* To calculate the total area of sod needed, we take the total plot area (10,000 square feet) and subtract the areas of the sidewalk and flower beds:
10,000 square feet - 150 square feet - 200 square feet - 120 square feet - 56 square feet = 9,474 square feet.

Answer: 9,474 square feet.
