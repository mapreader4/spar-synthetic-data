Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Prom tickets: 2 tickets at $100 each, so 2 x $100 = $200
* Dinner: $120
* Tip for dinner: 30% of $120 = 0.3 x $120 = $36
* Limo rental: 6 hours at $80 per hour, so 6 x $80 = $480

Now, we add up all the costs:
* $200 + $120 + $36 + $480 = $836

Answer: $836
