Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Five years ago, the sum of Sebastian's age and his sister's age was 3/4 of their father's age.
2) Sebastian is currently 40 years old, which means 5 years ago he was 35 years old.
3) Sebastian is 10 years older than his sister, so 5 years ago his sister was 25 years old.
4) The sum of Sebastian's age and his sister's age 5 years ago was 35 + 25 = 60.
5) The father's age 5 years ago was 60 / 3/4 = 80.
6) Therefore, the father's age today is 80 + 5 = 85.

Answer: 85
