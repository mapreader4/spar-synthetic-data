Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given the ratio of fuel used in gallons to the distance covered in miles as 4:7.
2) This means that for every 4 gallons of fuel used, the car covers 7 miles.
3) We are also given that Haley's car used 44 gallons of gas.
4) To find the distance covered, we need to set up a proportion:
4 gallons / 7 miles = 44 gallons / x miles
5) Cross-multiplying, we get:
4x = 308
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = 308/4 = 77 miles

Answer: 77 miles
