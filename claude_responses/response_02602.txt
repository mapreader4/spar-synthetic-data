Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each kid gets a burger with 400 calories
* Each kid gets 5 carrot sticks with 20 calories each, so 5 x 20 = 100 calories
* The total calories from the burger and carrot sticks is 400 + 100 = 500 calories
* Marissa wants each kid to eat a total of 750 calories for lunch
* To find the number of cookies each kid gets, we need to subtract the 500 calories from the burger and carrot sticks from the 750 total calories
* 750 calories - 500 calories = 250 calories
* Each cookie has 50 calories
* 250 calories / 50 calories per cookie = 5 cookies
