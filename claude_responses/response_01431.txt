Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The distance between Tony's town and his first friend's town is 120 miles.
* It takes Tony 3 hours to drive this distance.
* Therefore, his speed is 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour.
* The distance between Tony's first friend's town and his second friend's town is 200 miles.
* Since Tony is driving at the same speed of 40 miles per hour, the time it will take him to drive the 200 miles is:
* 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Answer: 5 hours.
