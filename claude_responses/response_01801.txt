Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Addilynn bought six dozen eggs. One dozen is 12 eggs, so six dozen is 6 x 12 = 72 eggs.
2) After two weeks, she used half of the eggs. Half of 72 is 72 / 2 = 36 eggs.
3) She then accidentally broke 15 of the remaining eggs.
4) The number of eggs remaining is the original 72 eggs, minus the 36 eggs she used, minus the 15 eggs she broke.
5) 72 - 36 - 15 = 21 eggs.

Answer: 21
