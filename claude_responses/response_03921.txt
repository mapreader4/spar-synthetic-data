Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We have four trees with the following characteristics:
   - Tree 1: 50 feet tall, 200 branches
   - Tree 2: 40 feet tall, 180 branches
   - Tree 3: 60 feet tall, 180 branches
   - Tree 4: 34 feet tall, 153 branches

2. To find the average number of branches per foot, we need to calculate the total number of branches and divide it by the total height of the trees.

3. Total number of branches:
   - Tree 1: 200 branches
   - Tree 2: 180 branches
   - Tree 3: 180 branches
   - Tree 4: 153 branches
   - Total branches = 200 + 180 + 180 + 153 = 713 branches

4. Total height of the trees:
   - Tree 1: 50 feet
   - Tree 2: 40 feet
   - Tree 3: 60 feet
   - Tree 4: 34 feet
   - Total height = 50 + 40 + 60 + 34 = 184 feet

5. Average number of branches per foot:
   - Average = Total branches / Total height
   - Average = 713 branches / 184 feet
   - Average = 3.88 branches per foot

Answer: 4 branches per foot (rounded to the nearest whole number).
