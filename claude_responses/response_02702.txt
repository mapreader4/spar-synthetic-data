Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Stephen ordered 2 large pizzas, each cut into 12 slices
* So the total number of slices is 2 * 12 = 24 slices
* Stephen ate 25% of the pizza
* 25% of 24 slices = 0.25 * 24 = 6 slices
* So there are 24 - 6 = 18 slices remaining
* Pete ate 50% of the remaining pizza
* 50% of 18 slices = 0.5 * 18 = 9 slices
* So the number of slices left over is 18 - 9 = 9 slices

Answer: 9
