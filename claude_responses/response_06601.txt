Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hakeem has $15 to spend on artichokes.
2) Artichokes cost $1.25 each.
3) It takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip.
4) To calculate how many ounces of dip Hakeem can make, we first need to find out how many artichokes he can buy with his $15.
5) $15 / $1.25 per artichoke = 12 artichokes.
6) Since it takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip, we can calculate the total ounces of dip he can make:
7) 12 artichokes / 3 artichokes per 5 ounces = 4 batches of 5 ounces each.
8) 4 batches x 5 ounces per batch = 20 ounces of dip.

Answer: 20 ounces.
