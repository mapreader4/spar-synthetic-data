Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sophie bought 4 boxes of donuts, and each box had 12 donuts.
2) So the total number of donuts she bought is 4 boxes x 12 donuts per box = 48 donuts.
3) She gave 1 box to her mom, which is 12 donuts.
4) She gave half a dozen (6) to her sister.
5) So the total number of donuts she gave away is 12 + 6 = 18 donuts.
6) The number of donuts left for her is the total she bought (48) minus the number she gave away (18).

Answer: 30 donuts.
