Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 3 years ago, Bethany was twice the age of her younger sister
* In 5 years, her younger sister will be 16
* So, the younger sister's current age is 16 - 5 = 11
* 3 years ago, the younger sister was 11 - 3 = 8 years old
* 3 years ago, Bethany was twice the age of her younger sister, so Bethany was 2 * 8 = 16 years old
* Now, Bethany is 16 + 3 = 19 years old

Answer: 19
