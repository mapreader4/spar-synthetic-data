Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca
* Roselyn remains with 60 books
* Rebecca received 40 books

Let's start by finding out how many books Roselyn gave to Mara:
* Roselyn gave Mara three times as many books as she gave Rebecca
* So, if Rebecca received 40 books, Mara received 3 * 40 = 120 books

Now, we can find the total number of books Roselyn had before:
* Roselyn remained with 60 books
* Roselyn gave away 120 books to Mara and 40 books to Rebecca
* So, the total number of books Roselyn had before was 60 + 120 + 40 = 220 books

Answer: 220
