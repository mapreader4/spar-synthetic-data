Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hearty bought 3 packages of blue beads
* Each package of blue beads has 40 beads
* So, the total number of blue beads is:
3 packages x 40 beads per package = 120 blue beads

* Hearty also bought 5 packages of red beads
* Each package of red beads has 40 beads
* So, the total number of red beads is:
5 packages x 40 beads per package = 200 red beads

* To find the total number of beads Hearty has, we add the blue and red beads together:
120 blue beads + 200 red beads = 320 beads

Answer: 320
