Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Abigail built 10 fences
* Each fence took her 30 minutes to build
* She will be building fences for the next 8 hours

First, we need to calculate how many fences she can build in 8 hours:
* 8 hours = 480 minutes
* 480 minutes / 30 minutes per fence = 16 fences

Now, we add the 10 fences she has already built to the 16 fences she will build in the next 8 hours:
* 10 fences + 16 fences = 26 fences

Answer: 26
