Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that a jug contains 5 liters of water.
2) We are also given that a bucket is filled with 4 jugs.
3) To find the amount of water in 1 bucket, we need to multiply the number of jugs (4) by the amount of water in each jug (5 liters).
4) 4 jugs x 5 liters per jug = 20 liters of water in 1 bucket.
5) The question asks how many liters of water are contained in 2 buckets.
6) To find this, we need to multiply the amount of water in 1 bucket (20 liters) by the number of buckets (2).
7) 20 liters x 2 buckets = 40 liters of water.

Answer: 40 liters
