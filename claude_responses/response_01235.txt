Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Penny starts with $20.
2) Penny buys 4 pairs of socks at $2 per pair. That means she spent 4 x $2 = $8 on the socks.
3) Penny also buys a hat for $7.
4) To calculate the total amount Penny spent, we add the cost of the socks ($8) and the cost of the hat ($7):
$8 + $7 = $15
5) Now, to find out how much money Penny has left, we subtract the total amount spent ($15) from the amount she started with ($20):
$20 - $15 = $5

Answer: 5
