Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wade's average points per game is 20.
2) His teammates' average points per game is 40.
3) We want to find the total points the team will have after 5 games.
4) Wade's total points in 5 games will be: 20 points per game x 5 games = 100 points.
5) His teammates' total points in 5 games will be: 40 points per game x 5 games = 200 points.
6) The total points the team will have after 5 games is the sum of Wade's points and his teammates' points:
100 points + 200 points = 300 points.

Answer: 300
