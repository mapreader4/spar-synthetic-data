Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There will be 10 people at the party, including Lucy
* Each person should get 1.2 pounds of potato chips
* The potato chips cost 25 cents per pound

To calculate the total amount of potato chips needed, we multiply the number of people (10) by the amount each person should get (1.2 pounds):
* 10 people x 1.2 pounds per person = 12 pounds of potato chips

Now, to calculate the total cost, we multiply the total amount of potato chips (12 pounds) by the cost per pound (25 cents):
* 12 pounds x $0.25 per pound = $3.00

Therefore, Lucy will pay $3.00 for the potato chips.
