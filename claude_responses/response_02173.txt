Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There were 45 kids and 123 adults at the Taylor family reunion.
2) The total number of people at the reunion is the sum of the kids and adults: 45 + 123 = 168 people.
3) There were 14 tables at which the people sat down to eat.
4) To find the number of people sitting at each table, we divide the total number of people by the number of tables: 168 รท 14 = 12 people per table.

Answer: 12
