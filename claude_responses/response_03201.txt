Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The church has 100 members who have volunteered to bake cookies
* Each member baked 10 sheets of cookies
* Each sheet has 16 cookies

To calculate the total number of cookies baked, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of cookies per member
   * Each member baked 10 sheets of cookies
   * Each sheet has 16 cookies
   * So, each member baked 10 * 16 = 160 cookies
2. Calculate the total number of cookies baked by all members
   * There are 100 members
   * Each member baked 160 cookies
   * So, the total number of cookies baked is 100 * 160 = 16,000 cookies

Answer: 16,000
