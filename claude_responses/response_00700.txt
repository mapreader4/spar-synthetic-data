Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Two white socks cost 45 cents
* This means one white sock costs 45 / 2 = 22.5 cents
* We know that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock
* So, the cost of a single brown sock is 22.5 - 25/2 = 10 cents
* Now, we want to find the cost of 15 brown socks
* Since each brown sock costs 10 cents, the cost of 15 brown socks is 15 * 10 = 150 cents
Answer: 150
