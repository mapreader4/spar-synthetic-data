Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The original length of the pole is 20 meters.
* The pole was cut in a way that left it 30% shorter.
* To find the new length of the pole, we need to calculate 30% of the original length and subtract that from the original length.
* 30% of 20 meters is 0.3 * 20 = 6 meters.
* Subtracting 6 meters from the original 20 meters gives us the new length of the pole.
* 20 meters - 6 meters = 14 meters.

Answer: 14 meters.
