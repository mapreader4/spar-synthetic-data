Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the total number of pencils Asaf has.
2) Asaf is 50 years old.
3) The sum of their ages is 140, so Alexander's age must be 140 - 50 = 90.
4) The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is 90 - 50 = 40.
5) Since the age difference is half the total number of pencils Asaf has, Asaf must have 40 x 2 = 80 pencils.
6) Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, so Alexander has 80 + 60 = 140 pencils.
7) The total number of pencils they have together is 80 + 140 = 220.

Answer: 220
