Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The building has 4 floors
* Each floor has 10 rooms
* So, the total number of rooms in the building is 4 floors x 10 rooms per floor = 40 rooms
* It takes Legacy 6 hours to clean one room
* So, to clean all 40 rooms, it will take Legacy 40 rooms x 6 hours per room = 240 hours
* Legacy earns $15 per hour of work
* Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from cleaning all the floors in the building is 240 hours x $15 per hour = $3,600
