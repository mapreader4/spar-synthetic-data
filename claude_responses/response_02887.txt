Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cara is 20 years younger than her mom
* Cara's mom is 15 years younger than Cara's grandmother
* Cara's grandmother is 75 years old

First, we need to find the age of Cara's mom:
* Cara's grandmother is 75 years old
* Cara's mom is 15 years younger than Cara's grandmother
* Therefore, Cara's mom is 75 - 15 = 60 years old

Next, we need to find Cara's age:
* Cara is 20 years younger than her mom
* Cara's mom is 60 years old
* Therefore, Cara is 60 - 20 = 40 years old

Answer: 40
