Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The minimum height to ride Kingda Ka is 140 cm.
2) Mary's brother is 180 cm tall.
3) Mary is 2/3 the height of her brother.
4) To find Mary's height, we take 2/3 of her brother's height: 2/3 * 180 cm = 120 cm.
5) To find how many more centimeters Mary needs to grow, we subtract her current height from the minimum height requirement: 140 cm - 120 cm = 20 cm.

Answer: 20
