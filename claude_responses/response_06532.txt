Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The difference in age between Declan's elder son and younger son is 10 years.
2) The elder son is 40 years old now.
3) To find the age of the younger son, we subtract 10 years from the elder son's age: 40 - 10 = 30 years old.
4) The question asks how old the younger son will be 30 years from now. To find this, we add 30 years to the younger son's current age: 30 + 30 = 60 years old.

Answer: 60
