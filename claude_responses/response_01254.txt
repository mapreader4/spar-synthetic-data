Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emilia needs 42 cartons of berries to make the berry cobbler.
2) She already has 2 cartons of strawberries and 7 cartons of blueberries in her cupboard.
3) To calculate the total number of cartons she already has, we add the strawberries and blueberries:
2 cartons of strawberries + 7 cartons of blueberries = 9 cartons of berries
4) To calculate the number of additional cartons she needs to buy, we subtract the number of cartons she already has from the total number of cartons she needs:
42 cartons needed - 9 cartons already owned = 33 cartons to buy

Answer: 33
