Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joe starts with $240
* He spends $50 a month on video games
* He sells each game for $30 once he's done playing them

To calculate how many months he can buy and sell games before running out of money, we need to find the net gain or loss per month.

* Cost per month: $50
* Revenue per month: $30 (assuming he sells one game per month)
* Net loss per month: $50 - $30 = $20

Now, we can calculate how many months he can sustain this net loss of $20 per month before running out of money.

* Starting amount: $240
* Net loss per month: $20
* Number of months = $240 / $20 = 12 months

Therefore, Joe can buy games at $50 and sell them at $30 for 12 months before running out of money.

Answer: 12
