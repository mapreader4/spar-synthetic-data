Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* We know that 70% of the students in the engineering department are men
* We also know that there are 180 women in the engineering department
* To find the number of men, we need to find the total number of students in the engineering department, and then calculate 70% of that total
* Let's call the total number of students in the engineering department "x"
* We know that 70% of x are men, and the remaining 30% are women
* So we can write the equation: 0.7x = 180
* Solving for x, we get x = 180 / 0.7 = 257
* Now that we know the total number of students is 257, we can calculate the number of men as 70% of that:
* Number of men = 0.7 * 257 = 180

Answer: 180
