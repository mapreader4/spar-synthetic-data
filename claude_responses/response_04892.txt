Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Liam's trip to Paris costs $7,000.
2) Liam's bills cost $3,500.
3) Liam has been saving $500 per month for 2 years.
4) 2 years is 24 months, so Liam has saved 24 * $500 = $12,000.
5) After paying his bills of $3,500, Liam will have $12,000 - $3,500 = $8,500 left.

Answer: $8,500
