Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 4 trains at the train station
* Each train has 4 carriages
* Each carriage has 3 rows of wheels
* Each row of wheels has 5 wheels

First, let's calculate the number of wheels per carriage:
* 3 rows of wheels per carriage
* 5 wheels per row
* 3 rows x 5 wheels per row = 15 wheels per carriage

Now, let's calculate the number of wheels per train:
* 4 carriages per train
* 15 wheels per carriage
* 4 carriages x 15 wheels per carriage = 60 wheels per train

Finally, let's calculate the total number of wheels at the train station:
* 4 trains
* 60 wheels per train
* 4 trains x 60 wheels per train = 240 wheels

Answer: 240
