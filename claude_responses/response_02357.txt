Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The clown cost $100 per hour and was hired for 4 hours.
   * Cost of the clown = $100 per hour x 4 hours = $400

2. The bounce house was rented for half the time of the clown, which is 2 hours.
   * The bounce house cost 3 times as much per hour as the clown.
   * Cost of the bounce house = $100 per hour x 3 x 2 hours = $600

3. The other expenses for the party cost $1000.

4. To calculate the total cost of the birthday party, we add up the costs of the clown, bounce house, and other expenses:
   * Total cost = Cost of clown + Cost of bounce house + Other expenses
   * Total cost = $400 + $600 + $1000 = $2000

Answer: $2000
