Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 500 students in the high school.
2) 40 percent of the students are juniors. To find the number of juniors, we take 40% of 500:
   * 40% of 500 = 0.40 * 500 = 200 juniors
3) 70 percent of the juniors are involved in sports. To find the number of juniors involved in sports, we take 70% of 200:
   * 70% of 200 = 0.70 * 200 = 140 juniors involved in sports.

Answer: 140
