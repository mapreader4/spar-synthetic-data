Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that the area of the circle is 100.
2) The area of a circle is calculated using the formula: A = π * r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.
3) Rearranging the formula, we get: r^2 = A / π
4) Plugging in the given area of 100, we get: r^2 = 100 / π
5) Taking the square root of both sides, we get: r = √(100 / π)
6) We are also given that the area of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the square.
7) The perimeter of a square is calculated using the formula: P = 4 * s, where P is the perimeter and s is the length of one side of the square.
8) Since the area of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the square, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:
π * r^2 = 4 * s
9) Plugging in the value of r that we calculated earlier, we get:
π * (√(100 / π))^2 = 4 * s
10) Simplifying, we get:
100 = 4 * s
11) Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
s = 25
Answer: 25
