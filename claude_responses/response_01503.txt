Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerome has 20 classmates on his contact list
* He has half as many out of school friends as classmates
* So, the number of out of school friends he has is 20 / 2 = 10
* He also has his two parents and his sister on his contact list
* So, the total number of people on Jerome's contact list is:
  - Classmates: 20
  - Out of school friends: 10
  - Parents: 2
  - Sister: 1
  - Total: 20 + 10 + 2 + 1 = 33
