Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat to get to the island called "Virgo"
* The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip
* The boat trip takes up to 2 hours

Let's call the duration of the boat trip "x" hours.
* Since the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, the duration of the plane trip is 4x hours.

The total travel time is the sum of the plane trip and the boat trip:
* Total travel time = 4x + x = 5x hours

We know that the boat trip takes up to 2 hours, so:
* x ≤ 2 hours

Substituting this into the total travel time equation:
* Total travel time = 5x ≤ 5 * 2 = 10 hours

Therefore, Tom is able to get to the "Virgo" island in 10 hours or less.
