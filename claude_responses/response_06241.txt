Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.
2) So, the total number of pieces is 5 oranges x 8 pieces per orange = 40 pieces.
3) He splits the 40 pieces between 4 people.
4) So, each person gets 40 pieces / 4 people = 10 pieces.
5) Each orange has 80 calories.
6) So, the total number of calories in the 40 pieces is 5 oranges x 80 calories per orange = 400 calories.
7) Each person gets 400 calories / 4 people = 100 calories.

Answer: 100
