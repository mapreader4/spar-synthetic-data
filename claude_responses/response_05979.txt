Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The average GPA for 6th graders is 93
* The average GPA for 7th graders is 2 more than the 6th graders, which means it is 93 + 2 = 95
* The average GPA for 8th graders is 91

To find the average GPA for the school, we need to calculate the total GPA for all three grades and then divide it by the total number of grades.

Total GPA:
* 6th grade: 93
* 7th grade: 95
* 8th grade: 91
* Total GPA = 93 + 95 + 91 = 279

Number of grades:
* There are 3 grades (6th, 7th, and 8th)

Average GPA for the school:
* Total GPA / Number of grades = 279 / 3 = 93

Answer: 93
