Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) It takes 320 rose petals to make an ounce of perfume.
2) Each rose produces 8 petals.
3) There are 12 roses per bush.
4) Fern needs to make 20 12-ounce bottles of perfume.
5) To calculate the total number of petals needed, we first need to find the total number of ounces of perfume required:
   * 20 bottles x 12 ounces per bottle = 240 ounces of perfume
6) Since it takes 320 petals per ounce, the total number of petals needed is:
   * 240 ounces x 320 petals/ounce = 76,800 petals
7) Since each rose produces 8 petals, and there are 12 roses per bush, the number of petals per bush is:
   * 8 petals/rose x 12 roses/bush = 96 petals/bush
8) To find the number of bushes needed, we divide the total number of petals needed by the number of petals per bush:
   * 76,800 petals / 96 petals/bush = 800 bushes

Answer: 800 bushes
