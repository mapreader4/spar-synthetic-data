Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The camera's value is $5000.
2) The rental fee is 10% of the value per week.
   * Rental fee per week = 10% of $5000 = $500
   * Rental fee for 4 weeks = $500 x 4 = $2000
3) John's friend agreed to pay 40% of the rental fee.
   * 40% of $2000 = $800
4) John's portion of the rental fee is the remaining 60%.
   * 60% of $2000 = $1200
Therefore, the amount John paid is:
Answer: $1200
