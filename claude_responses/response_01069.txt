Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Maria originally had:
- 4 dimes, which is 4 x $0.10 = $0.40
- 4 quarters, which is 4 x $0.25 = $1.00
- 7 nickels, which is 7 x $0.05 = $0.35
2) The total amount of money Maria had originally is $0.40 + $1.00 + $0.35 = $1.75
3) Her mom then gave her 5 quarters, which is 5 x $0.25 = $1.25
4) So the total amount of money Maria has now is $1.75 + $1.25 = $3.00

Answer: $3.00
