Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The banana tree has 100 bananas left after Raj cut some bananas from it.
2) Raj has eaten 70 bananas.
3) Raj has twice as many remaining in his basket as he has eaten.
4) To find the total number of bananas on the tree initially, we need to add the number of bananas Raj has eaten and the number of bananas remaining on the tree.
5) The number of bananas Raj has eaten is 70.
6) The number of bananas remaining in Raj's basket is twice the number of bananas he has eaten, which is 2 * 70 = 140.
7) The total number of bananas on the tree initially is the sum of the bananas Raj has eaten (70) and the bananas remaining on the tree (100), which is 70 + 100 = 170.

Answer: 170
