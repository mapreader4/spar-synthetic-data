Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Niko bought 9 pairs of socks that cost $2 each.
   * Total cost of the socks = 9 pairs x $2 per pair = $18

2. He wants to gain a 25% profit from 4 of the pairs of socks.
   * 25% of $2 (the cost of each pair) = 0.25 x $2 = $0.50 profit per pair
   * Profit from 4 pairs = 4 pairs x $0.50 profit per pair = $2 profit

3. He wants to gain a $0.20 profit each for the other 5 pairs of socks.
   * Profit from 5 pairs = 5 pairs x $0.20 profit per pair = $1 profit

4. To calculate the total profit:
   * Total profit = Profit from 4 pairs + Profit from 5 pairs
   * Total profit = $2 + $1 = $3

Answer: $3
