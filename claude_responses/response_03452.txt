Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than 2 hours of screen time per day for children.
2) Mrs. Merril wants to follow this 2-hour screen time recommendation for her child.
3) The child has already used his gadget for 45 minutes in the morning.
4) To calculate the remaining screen time allowed for the evening, we need to subtract the 45 minutes used in the morning from the total 2-hour (120 minutes) recommendation.
5) 120 minutes - 45 minutes = 75 minutes.

Answer: 75 minutes
