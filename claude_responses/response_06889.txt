Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ben starts with $2000 for his business operations costs.
2) He orders goods from his supplier and writes them a cheque for $600. This means he now has $2000 - $600 = $1400 remaining.
3) His debtor pays him $800 from the purchases they had made on credit. This means he now has $1400 + $800 = $2200 remaining.
4) Mr. Ben then decides to do equipment maintenance and spends $1200 on the whole operation. This means he now has $2200 - $1200 = $1000 remaining.

Answer: $1000
