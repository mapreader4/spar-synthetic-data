Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack has 65 pounds of sugar today
* Tomorrow, he will use 18 pounds of sugar
* So, after tomorrow, he will have 65 - 18 = 47 pounds of sugar
* The following day, he will buy 50 more pounds of sugar
* So, the total amount of sugar he will have in the end is 47 + 50 = 97 pounds
