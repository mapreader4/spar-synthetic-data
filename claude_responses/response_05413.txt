Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Ben wants to pick 56 sugar snap peas, and it will take him 7 minutes to pick them all.
2) This means that Ben can pick 56 / 7 = 8 sugar snap peas per minute.
3) Now, Ben wants to pick 72 sugar snap peas.
4) Since Ben can pick 8 sugar snap peas per minute, it will take him 72 / 8 = 9 minutes to pick 72 sugar snap peas.

Answer: 9 minutes.
