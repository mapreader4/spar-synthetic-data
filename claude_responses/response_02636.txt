Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Charlize was 20 minutes late
* 4 of her classmates were each 10 minutes later than Charlize
* So, each of the 4 classmates was 20 minutes late (10 minutes later than Charlize's 20 minutes)
* The total time for the 5 students (Charlize and the 4 classmates) is:
    - Charlize: 20 minutes
    - 4 classmates: 4 x 20 minutes = 80 minutes
* Adding these together, the total time for which the 5 students were late is:
    - 20 minutes + 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Answer: 100
