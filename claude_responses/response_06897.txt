Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mike gets paid $100 a week.
2) He decides to spend half of that at the arcade, which is $50.
3) He spends $10 on food at the arcade, so he has $40 left to spend on arcade tokens.
4) He can play for 1 hour for $8, so with $40 he can play for:
$40 / $8 per hour = 5 hours
5) Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 5 hours = 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

Answer: 300 minutes
