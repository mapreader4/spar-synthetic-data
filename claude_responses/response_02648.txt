Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The ratio of the ages of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively.
2) This means that Halima's age is 4 parts, Beckham's age is 3 parts, and Michelle's age is 7 parts.
3) The total of these parts is 4 + 3 + 7 = 14.
4) The total age of the three siblings is 126.
5) To find the age of each sibling, we need to divide the total age (126) by the total parts (14).
6) This gives us 126 / 14 = 9 as the value of each part.
7) Therefore, Halima's age is 4 * 9 = 36, Beckham's age is 3 * 9 = 27, and Michelle's age is 7 * 9 = 63.
8) The age difference between Halima and Beckham is 36 - 27 = 9.

Answer: 9
