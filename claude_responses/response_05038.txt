Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There were 148 peanuts in the jar initially.
2) Brock ate one-fourth of the peanuts. To find one-fourth of 148, we divide 148 by 4: 148 / 4 = 37. So Brock ate 37 peanuts.
3) Bonita ate 29 peanuts.
4) To find the number of peanuts remaining in the jar, we start with the initial 148 peanuts, then subtract the 37 peanuts Brock ate and the 29 peanuts Bonita ate:
148 - 37 - 29 = 82 peanuts remaining.

Answer: 82
