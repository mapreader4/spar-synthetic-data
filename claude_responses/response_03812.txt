Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Don throws 3 darts
* One dart is a bullseye worth 50 points
* One dart completely missed the target, so it received 0 points
* The third dart was worth half the points of the bullseye

To calculate the final score:
* Bullseye worth 50 points
* Third dart worth half of 50 points, which is 25 points
* Total points = 50 + 0 + 25 = 75 points

Answer: 75
