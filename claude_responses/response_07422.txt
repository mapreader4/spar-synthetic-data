Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The punch bowl can hold 16 gallons of punch.
2) Mark fills the bowl part way, then his cousin drinks half of the punch in the bowl.
3) Mark then adds 4 more gallons of punch.
4) Sally then drinks 2 gallons of punch.
5) Finally, Mark has to add 12 gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl.

To find the initial amount of punch Mark added to the bowl, we can work backwards:
* Mark added 12 gallons to completely fill the bowl
* Sally drank 2 gallons, so the bowl had 14 gallons before that
* Mark added 4 gallons, so the bowl had 10 gallons before that
* Mark's cousin drank half of the 10 gallons, so the bowl had 5 gallons before that
* Therefore, Mark initially added 5 gallons of punch to the bowl.
