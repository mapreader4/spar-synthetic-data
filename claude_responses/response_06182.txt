Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The office canteen has 2 round tables and 2 rectangular tables
* Each round table has 6 chairs
* Each rectangular table has 7 chairs
* To find the total number of chairs, we need to calculate the number of chairs for each table type and then add them together.

For the round tables:
* 2 round tables x 6 chairs per table = 12 chairs

For the rectangular tables:
* 2 rectangular tables x 7 chairs per table = 14 chairs

Now, we add the chairs from the round tables and the rectangular tables:
* 12 chairs + 14 chairs = 26 chairs

Answer: 26
