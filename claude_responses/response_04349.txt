Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mars can be seen until 12:10 AM
* Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes after Mars disappears
* Uranus appears 3 hours and 16 minutes after Jupiter makes its first appearance

First, we need to find out when Jupiter appears:
* Mars disappears at 12:10 AM
* Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes later
* 12:10 AM + 2 hours and 41 minutes = 2:51 AM

Now, we need to find out when Uranus appears:
* Jupiter appears at 2:51 AM
* Uranus appears 3 hours and 16 minutes later
* 2:51 AM + 3 hours and 16 minutes = 6:07 AM

Therefore, Uranus first appears in the evening sky over Texas this evening 7 minutes after 6:00 AM.
