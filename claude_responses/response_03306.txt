Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day
* In the first week, he jogs for 3 days
* In the second week, he jogs for 5 days
* To calculate the total time he jogs in two weeks:
* First week: 3 days x 30 minutes = 90 minutes
* Second week: 5 days x 30 minutes = 150 minutes
* Total minutes in two weeks: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes
* To convert to hours:
* 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Answer: 4 hours
