Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In the first hour, Kylie picks 66 apples.
2) In the second hour, Kylie doubles her apple picking rate, so she picks 2 x 66 = 132 apples.
3) In the third hour, Kylie picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour, so she picks 66 / 3 = 22 apples.
4) To calculate the total number of apples Kylie picked, we add up the apples picked in each hour:
   66 + 132 + 22 = 220 apples.

Answer: 220
