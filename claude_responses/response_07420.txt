Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nikola wants 400 ants in his farm.
2) Each ant needs 2 ounces of food.
3) So the total amount of food needed is 400 ants x 2 ounces = 800 ounces of food.
4) Each ounce of ant food costs $0.10.
5) So the total cost of the ant food is 800 ounces x $0.10 = $80.
6) Nikola charges $5 to start a job and 1 penny per leaf.
7) He raked 6,000 leaves.
8) So the total amount he earned from raking leaves is $5 + (6,000 leaves x $0.01) = $65.
9) To calculate the number of jobs he completed, we need to divide the total amount he earned ($65) by the $5 he charges to start a job.
10) $65 / $5 = 13 jobs.

Answer: 13 jobs.
