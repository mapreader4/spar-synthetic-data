Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Chicago Cubs scored:
  - 2 home runs in the third inning
  - 1 home run in the fifth inning
  - 2 home runs in the eighth inning
* So the total number of home runs scored by the Chicago Cubs is:
  - 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 home runs
* The Cardinals scored:
  - 1 home run in the second inning
  - 1 home run in the fifth inning
* So the total number of home runs scored by the Cardinals is:
  - 1 + 1 = 2 home runs
* To find the difference in home runs scored, we subtract the Cardinals' total from the Cubs' total:
  - 5 home runs - 2 home runs = 3 home runs
