Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 600 people in the stadium at the start of the game.
2) There were 240 girls at the beginning of the game.
3) The number of boys at the beginning of the game would be 600 - 240 = 360.
4) One-fourth of the boys left early, which means 360 / 4 = 90 boys left early.
5) One-eighth of the girls left early, which means 240 / 8 = 30 girls left early.
6) The total number of people who left early is 90 boys + 30 girls = 120 people.
7) The number of people who remained to see the end of the game is 600 - 120 = 480 people.

Answer: 480
