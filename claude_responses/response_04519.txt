Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kendra made an unknown number of buttons.
2) Sue made half as many buttons as Kendra, so if Kendra made x buttons, then Sue made x/2 buttons.
3) We know that Sue made 6 buttons, so x/2 = 6, which means x = 12.
4) Kendra made 12 buttons.
5) Mari made 4 more than five times as many buttons as Kendra. So if Kendra made 12 buttons, then Mari made 5 * 12 + 4 = 64 buttons.

Answer: 64
