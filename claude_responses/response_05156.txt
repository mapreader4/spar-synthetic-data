Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The man originally had 39 cows
* Last year, 25 of them died and he sold 6 of them
* So, the number of cows he had after last year was 39 - 25 - 6 = 8 cows
* This year, the number of cows increased by 24
* So, the number of cows he had after the increase was 8 + 24 = 32 cows
* The man then bought 43 more cows
* So, the number of cows he had after buying 43 more was 32 + 43 = 75 cows
* His friend then gave him 8 more cows as a gift
* So, the total number of cows the man has now is 75 + 8 = 83 cows

Answer: 83
