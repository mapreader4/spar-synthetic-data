Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The person borrowed an amount of money for a year at an interest rate of 12%.
2) The total interest paid is $1500.
3) The formula for simple interest is: I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal (original borrowed amount), r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.
4) Substituting the given values, we get:
$1500 = P * 0.12 * 1
5) Solving for P, we get:
P = $1500 / (0.12 * 1)
P = $12,500

Answer: $12,500
