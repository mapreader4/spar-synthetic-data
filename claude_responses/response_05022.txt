Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Georgie can currently run 40 yards within 5 seconds.
2) This means his current speed is 40 yards / 5 seconds = 8 yards per second.
3) If he can improve his speed by 40%, his new speed will be 8 yards per second + (40% of 8 yards per second) = 8 yards per second + 3.2 yards per second = 11.2 yards per second.
4) In 10 seconds, he will be able to run 11.2 yards per second * 10 seconds = 112 yards.

Answer: 112
