Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Monika went to the mall and spent $250.

2. She then went to the movies and watched 3 movies that each cost $24. So, the total cost of the movies would be:
   3 movies x $24 per movie = $72

3. Finally, she stopped by the farmer's market and got 20 bags of beans at $1.25 per bag. The total cost of the beans would be:
   20 bags x $1.25 per bag = $25

4. Now, we add up all the expenses:
   $250 (mall) + $72 (movies) + $25 (beans) = $347

Answer: $347
