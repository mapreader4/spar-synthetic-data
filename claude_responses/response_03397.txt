Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Leo and Ryan together have $48.
2. Ryan owns 2/3 of the amount, which means Ryan has 2/3 of $48, which is $32.
3. Leo has the remaining 1/3 of $48, which is $16.
4. Ryan owed Leo $10, and Leo owed Ryan $7. So, the net amount that Ryan owes Leo is $10 - $7 = $3.
5. After the debts have been settled, Leo has the $16 he originally had, plus the $3 that Ryan owed him, which is a total of $19.

Answer: 19
