Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that there are 14 kindergartners and 24 first graders in Ms. Watson's class.
2) We also know that the total number of students in Ms. Watson's class is 42.
3) To find the number of second graders, we need to subtract the number of kindergartners and first graders from the total number of students.
4) 42 (total students) - 14 (kindergartners) - 24 (first graders) = 4 second graders.

Answer: 4
