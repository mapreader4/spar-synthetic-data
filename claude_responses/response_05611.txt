Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The outdoor scouts took 3 cars, 6 taxis, and 2 vans to get to the hike.
* Each car had 4 people, each taxi had 6 people, and each van had 5 people.
* To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of people in each type of vehicle and then add them up.

For the cars:
* 3 cars with 4 people each
* 3 x 4 = 12 people in the cars

For the taxis:
* 6 taxis with 6 people each
* 6 x 6 = 36 people in the taxis

For the vans:
* 2 vans with 5 people each
* 2 x 5 = 10 people in the vans

Now, we add up the total number of people:
* 12 + 36 + 10 = 58 people

Answer: 58
