Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, Sol sells 10 candy bars
* Each day after, she sells 4 more candy bars than the previous day
* So, on the second day, she sells 10 + 4 = 14 candy bars
* On the third day, she sells 14 + 4 = 18 candy bars
* On the fourth day, she sells 18 + 4 = 22 candy bars
* On the fifth day, she sells 22 + 4 = 26 candy bars
* On the sixth day, she sells 26 + 4 = 30 candy bars
* Each candy bar costs 10 cents
* So, the total earnings for the week would be:
* Day 1: 10 candy bars x 10 cents = $1.00
* Day 2: 14 candy bars x 10 cents = $1.40
* Day 3: 18 candy bars x 10 cents = $1.80
* Day 4: 22 candy bars x 10 cents = $2.20
* Day 5: 26 candy bars x 10 cents = $2.60
* Day 6: 30 candy bars x 10 cents = $3.00
* Total earnings for the week = $1.00 + $1.40 + $1.80 + $2.20 + $2.60 + $3.00 = $12.00

Answer: $12.00
