Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 26 chickens, 40 piglets, and 34 goats at Stacy's farm.
2) A really bad storm hits and half of all the animals get sick.
3) To find the total number of animals that get sick, we need to calculate half of the total number of animals.
4) The total number of animals is 26 chickens + 40 piglets + 34 goats = 100 animals.
5) Half of 100 animals is 50 animals.

Answer: 50
