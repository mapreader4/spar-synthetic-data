Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kimberly's brother picked 3 baskets, each containing 15 strawberries
* So, the total number of strawberries her brother picked is:
    - 3 baskets x 15 strawberries per basket = 45 strawberries
* Kimberly picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked
    - 8 x 45 strawberries = 360 strawberries
* Kimberly's parents picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly
    - 360 strawberries - 93 strawberries = 267 strawberries
* The total number of strawberries picked is:
    - Kimberly's brother: 45 strawberries
    - Kimberly: 360 strawberries
    - Kimberly's parents: 267 strawberries
    - Total: 45 + 360 + 267 = 672 strawberries
* If they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them, each person would have:
    - 672 strawberries / 4 people = 168 strawberries

Answer: 168
