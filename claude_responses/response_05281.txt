Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The husband gives $335 every week
* The wife gives $225 every week
* They save for 6 months, which is 24 weeks (4 weeks per month)
* The husband's total contribution is $335 x 24 = $8,040
* The wife's total contribution is $225 x 24 = $5,400
* The total amount saved by the couple is $8,040 + $5,400 = $13,440
* They decide to divide half of the savings, which is $13,440 / 2 = $6,720
* They have 4 children, so each child receives $6,720 / 4 = $1,680

Answer: $1,680
