Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Emily is currently 20 years old
* Rachel is currently 24 years old
* We want to find out how old Rachel will be when Emily is half her age

To find this, we need to determine when Emily will be half of Rachel's age.
* If Emily is half of Rachel's age, then Emily's age will be 1/2 of Rachel's age
* So, we need to find the age when 1/2 of Rachel's age is equal to Emily's age
* Rachel's age when 1/2 of Rachel's age is equal to Emily's age of 20 is:
* 1/2 of Rachel's age = 20
* Rachel's age = 20 * 2 = 40

Answer: 40
