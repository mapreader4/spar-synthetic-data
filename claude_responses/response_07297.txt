Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lauryn made $2000 from selling old electronics on eBay
* Aurelia made 70% of what Lauryn made on eBay after selling her used electronics

To calculate the total amount of money the two friends made on eBay, we need to add Lauryn's earnings and Aurelia's earnings.

Aurelia's earnings:
* Aurelia made 70% of what Lauryn made
* Lauryn made $2000
* 70% of $2000 = 0.7 * $2000 = $1400

Total amount of money the two friends made on eBay:
* Lauryn's earnings: $2000
* Aurelia's earnings: $1400
* Total: $2000 + $1400 = $3400

Answer: $3400
