Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackson spends 9 hours playing video games
* He spends 1/3 of that time studying
* 1/3 of 9 hours is 3 hours
* For every hour he spends studying, his grade increases by 15 points
* So, for 3 hours of studying, his grade increases by 15 points x 3 hours = 45 points

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 45
