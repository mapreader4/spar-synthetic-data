Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Costco sells 1 gallon of mayo for $8
* 1 gallon = 128 ounces
* At the normal store, a 16-ounce bottle costs $3
* To calculate the cost of 128 ounces at the normal store, we need to divide 128 by 16 to get the number of 16-ounce bottles needed:
* 128 รท 16 = 8 bottles
* 8 bottles x $3 per bottle = $24
* The difference between the cost at Costco ($8) and the cost at the normal store ($24) is the amount of money Jim saves:
* $24 - $8 = $16

Answer: $16
