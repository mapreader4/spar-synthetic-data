Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each angel food cake calls for 8 egg whites
* Since there are 2 angel food cakes, the total number of egg whites needed is 8 x 2 = 16 egg whites
* Every 2 tablespoons of aquafaba is equivalent to 1 egg white
* To find the total number of tablespoons of aquafaba needed, we need to multiply the total number of egg whites (16) by 2, since 2 tablespoons of aquafaba is equivalent to 1 egg white
* 16 egg whites x 2 tablespoons per egg white = 32 tablespoons of aquafaba

Answer: 32 tablespoons of aquafaba
