Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 1 lizard is worth 8 bottle caps
* 3 lizards are worth 5 gallons of water
* 1 horse is worth 80 gallons of water
* Marla can scavenge for 20 bottle caps each day
* Marla needs to pay 4 bottle caps per night for food and shelter

First, we need to figure out how many bottle caps are needed to buy a horse.
* 1 horse is worth 80 gallons of water
* 3 lizards are worth 5 gallons of water
* So 1 horse is worth 80 / 5 * 3 = 48 lizards
* 1 lizard is worth 8 bottle caps
* So 1 horse is worth 48 * 8 = 384 bottle caps

Next, we need to figure out how much Marla can save each day.
* Marla can scavenge 20 bottle caps each day
* Marla needs to pay 4 bottle caps per night for food and shelter
* So Marla can save 20 - 4 = 16 bottle caps each day

Finally, we can calculate how many days it will take Marla to save up 384 bottle caps.
* Marla can save 16 bottle caps per day
* 384 bottle caps / 16 bottle caps per day = 24 days

Answer: 24 days
