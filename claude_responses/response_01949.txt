Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Albert needs to buy:
   - A paintbrush that costs $1.50
   - A set of paints that costs $4.35
   - A wooden easel that costs $12.65
2) The total cost of these items is:
   - $1.50 + $4.35 + $12.65 = $18.50
3) Albert already has $6.50
4) To calculate how much more money Albert needs, we subtract the amount he already has ($6.50) from the total cost ($18.50):
   - $18.50 - $6.50 = $12.00
