Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tanya bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums
* All of the fruit was placed in a single paper bag
* The bag had a hole, and half of the fruit fell out as Tanya walked home
* After the fruit fell out, there were only 9 pieces of fruit remaining in the bag

To find the number of plums Tanya bought, we need to first calculate the total number of pieces of fruit she bought initially.

The total number of pieces of fruit is:
* 6 pears + 4 Granny Smith apples + 2 pineapples + the number of plums

Since half of the fruit fell out, the 9 pieces remaining must be half of the original total.

So, the original total number of pieces of fruit was:
* 9 x 2 = 18 pieces

Now we can plug in the known quantities:
* 18 = 6 + 4 + 2 + the number of plums
* the number of plums = 18 - 6 - 4 - 2 = 6

Therefore, Tanya bought 6 plums.
