Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 325 students in the high school.
2) 40% of the students have glasses.
3) To find the number of students who have glasses, we can take 40% of 325:
   * 40% of 325 = 0.40 * 325 = 130 students have glasses.
4) To find the number of students who do not have glasses, we need to subtract the number of students with glasses from the total number of students:
   * 325 - 130 = 195 students do not have glasses.

Answer: 195
