Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Betty's account balance is $3,456.
2) Gina has two bank accounts, and each of Gina's accounts has a quarter (1/4) of the balance in Betty's account.
3) To find the balance in each of Gina's accounts, we take 1/4 of Betty's account balance:
   1/4 of $3,456 = $864
4) Since Gina has two accounts, each with a balance of $864, the combined balance of both Gina's accounts is:
   $864 + $864 = $1,728

Answer: $1,728
