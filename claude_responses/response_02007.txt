Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Merry is taking care of 10 lambs
* Her brother takes care of 3 more lambs than Merry
* To find the total number of lambs Merry and her brother have, we need to add the number of lambs Merry has and the number of lambs her brother has

First, let's find the number of lambs her brother has:
* Merry has 10 lambs
* Her brother has 3 more lambs than Merry
* So her brother has 10 + 3 = 13 lambs

Now, to find the total number of lambs Merry and her brother have:
* Merry has 10 lambs
* Her brother has 13 lambs
* So the total number of lambs is 10 + 13 = 23 lambs

Answer: 23
