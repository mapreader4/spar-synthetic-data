Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Lady Eagles basketball team scored a total of 311 points in 5 games.
* Some players combined for 188 points.
* The remaining points were scored equally by Lisa, Jessie, and Devin.

To find how many points Jessie scored, we need to first find the total points scored by Lisa, Jessie, and Devin.
* Total points scored = 311 points
* Points scored by some players = 188 points
* Points scored by Lisa, Jessie, and Devin = 311 - 188 = 123 points

Since Lisa, Jessie, and Devin scored the remaining points equally, we can divide the 123 points by 3 to find how many points each of them scored.
* Points scored by each of Lisa, Jessie, and Devin = 123 / 3 = 41 points

Therefore, Jessie scored 41 points.

Answer: 41
