Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Anna baked 60 cupcakes
2) She gives away 4/5 of the cupcakes to her classmates

3) The remaining 1/5 of the cupcakes is 1/5 * 60 = 12 cupcakes
4) Of the remaining 12 cupcakes, she eats 3 cupcakes
5) The number of cupcakes she has left is 12 - 3 = 9 cupcakes
