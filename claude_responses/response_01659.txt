Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We are told that the number of redwoods is 20% more than the number of pines.
2) We are also told that there are 600 pines in the national park.
3) To find the number of redwoods, we need to calculate 20% of 600, which is 0.2 * 600 = 120.
4) So the number of redwoods is 600 + 120 = 720.
5) The total number of pines and redwoods is 600 + 720 = 1,320.

Answer: 1,320
