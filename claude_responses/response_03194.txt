Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 1000 guests at the birthday party
* 30% of the guests are married
* 50% of the guests are single
* The remaining guests are children

First, let's calculate the number of married guests:
* 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 married guests

Next, let's calculate the number of single guests:
* 50% of 1000 = 0.50 * 1000 = 500 single guests

Finally, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the married and single guests from the total:
* 1000 - 300 - 500 = 200 children

Now, to find the difference between the number of married guests and the number of children, we subtract:
* 300 married guests - 200 children = 100 more married guests than children

Answer: 100
