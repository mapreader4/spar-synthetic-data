Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jessica has a basic cable television service for $15 per month.
* If she adds the movie channels, it will cost an additional $12 per month.
* The sports channels cost $3 less per month than the movie channels.
* So, the cost of the sports channels is $12 - $3 = $9 per month.
* If Jessica adds the movie channels and the sports channels, her total monthly payment will be:
* Basic cable: $15 per month
* Movie channels: $12 per month
* Sports channels: $9 per month
* Total monthly payment: $15 + $12 + $9 = $36 per month.
