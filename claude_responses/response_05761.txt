Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farmer has 52 cows
* Each cow gives 5 liters of milk per day
* We want to find the total amount of milk the farmer gets in a week

To calculate the total amount of milk in a week, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount of milk per day
2. Multiply the daily amount by the number of days in a week

Step 1: Calculating the total amount of milk per day
* Each cow gives 5 liters of milk per day
* There are 52 cows
* So the total amount of milk per day is 52 cows x 5 liters/cow = 260 liters

Step 2: Calculating the total amount of milk in a week
* There are 7 days in a week
* So the total amount of milk in a week is 260 liters/day x 7 days = 1,820 liters

Answer: 1,820 liters
