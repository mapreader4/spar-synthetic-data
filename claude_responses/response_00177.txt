Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. James sold his $20,000 car for 80% of its value.
   * 80% of $20,000 = 0.8 * $20,000 = $16,000

2. James then bought a $30,000 sticker price car for 90% of its value.
   * 90% of $30,000 = 0.9 * $30,000 = $27,000

3. To calculate how much James was out of pocket, we need to add the amount he received from selling his car ($16,000) and subtract it from the amount he paid for the new car ($27,000).
   * $27,000 - $16,000 = $11,000

Therefore, James was out of pocket $11,000.

Answer: 11000
