Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Joshua and Justin shared $40 in total.
2) Joshua's share was thrice as much as Justin's share.
3) Let's call Justin's share 'x'.
4) Then Joshua's share would be '3x'.
5) The total amount shared is $40, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x = 40
4x = 40
x = 10
6) Since Justin's share is 'x', and x = 10, then Justin's share is $10.
7) Since Joshua's share is '3x', and x = 10, then Joshua's share is 3 * $10 = $30.

Answer: 30
