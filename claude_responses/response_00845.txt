Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The show can have 5 actors at a time
* Each actor is in the show for about 15 minutes
* After 15 minutes, another 5 actors come in
* We want to know how many actors can be on the show in 1 hour (60 minutes)

To calculate the number of actors in 1 hour, we need to determine how many sets of 5 actors can fit into 60 minutes.

* Each set of 5 actors lasts for 15 minutes
* 60 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 4 sets of 5 actors

Therefore, in 1 hour, there can be 4 sets of 5 actors, which is a total of:
4 sets x 5 actors per set = 20 actors

Answer: 20
