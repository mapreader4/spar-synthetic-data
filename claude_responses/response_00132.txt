Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James buys 5 packs of beef
* Each pack is 4 pounds
* So the total weight of beef is 5 packs x 4 pounds per pack = 20 pounds
* The price of beef is $5.50 per pound
* To calculate the total cost, we multiply the total weight (20 pounds) by the price per pound ($5.50)
* 20 pounds x $5.50 per pound = $110

Answer: $110
