Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chocolate cake requires 3 eggs per cake
* 5 chocolate cakes would require 5 * 3 = 15 eggs
* Cheesecake requires 8 eggs per cake
* 9 cheesecakes would require 9 * 8 = 72 eggs
* To find the difference, we subtract the number of eggs needed for the chocolate cakes from the number of eggs needed for the cheesecakes:
* 72 eggs - 15 eggs = 57 eggs

Answer: 57
