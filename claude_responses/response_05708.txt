Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Reuben sells 10 Reubens and 5 Pastrami sandwiches
* Pastrami costs $2 more than the Reuben
* The total earnings from selling these sandwiches is $55

Let's define the variables:
* Let x = the cost of a Reuben sandwich
* Then the cost of a Pastrami sandwich is x + $2

The total earnings can be calculated as:
* 10 Reubens at x each, plus 5 Pastrami sandwiches at x + $2 each
* Total earnings = 10x + 5(x + $2) = 10x + 5x + $10 = 15x + $10

We are told the total earnings is $55, so we can set up an equation:
* 15x + $10 = $55
* 15x = $45
* x = $3

Since the Pastrami sandwich costs $2 more than the Reuben, the cost of a Pastrami sandwich is:
* x + $2 = $3 + $2 = $5

Answer: $5
