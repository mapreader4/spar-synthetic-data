Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Claudia charges $10.00 per one-hour art class.
2) On Saturday, 20 kids attended the class.
3) To calculate the money made on Saturday, we multiply the number of kids (20) by the cost per class ($10.00):
   20 kids x $10.00 per class = $200.00
4) On Sunday, half as many kids attended the class as on Saturday, which is 10 kids.
5) To calculate the money made on Sunday, we multiply the number of kids (10) by the cost per class ($10.00):
   10 kids x $10.00 per class = $100.00
6) To calculate the total money Claudia made, we add the money made on Saturday and Sunday:
   $200.00 + $100.00 = $300.00

Answer: $300
