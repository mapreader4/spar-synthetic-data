Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lucille earns 6 cents for every weed she pulls.
2) There are 11 weeds in the flower bed, 14 in the vegetable patch, and 32 in the grass around the fruit trees.
3) Lucille weeded the flower bed, the vegetable patch, and half the grass before she took a break.
4) So for the flower bed, she earned 11 x 6 = 66 cents.
5) For the vegetable patch, she earned 14 x 6 = 84 cents.
6) For the grass, she weeded half of the 32 weeds, so 16 weeds, earning 16 x 6 = 96 cents.
7) In total, she earned 66 + 84 + 96 = 246 cents.
8) She then bought a soda for 99 cents.
9) So the amount of cents Lucille has left is 246 - 99 = 147 cents.
