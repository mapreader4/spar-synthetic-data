Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bill has two 2-gallon jugs.
2) Each jug is filled 70% full with sand.
3) The density of sand is 5 pounds per gallon.

To calculate the total weight of the improvised weights:
* Each jug has a capacity of 2 gallons.
* Since each jug is filled 70% full, the amount of sand in each jug is:
  * 2 gallons x 0.70 = 1.4 gallons
* The weight of the sand in each jug is:
  * 1.4 gallons x 5 pounds/gallon = 7 pounds
* Since there are two jugs, the total weight is:
  * 7 pounds x 2 = 14 pounds

Answer: 14 pounds
