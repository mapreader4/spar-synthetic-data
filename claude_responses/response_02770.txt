Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Robert orders:
   - 5 boxes of pizza at $10 each
   - 10 cans of soft drinks at $2 each
2. Teddy buys:
   - 6 hamburgers at $3 each
   - 10 cans of soft drinks at $2 each

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
* Robert's order:
  - 5 boxes of pizza at $10 each = 5 x $10 = $50
  - 10 cans of soft drinks at $2 each = 10 x $2 = $20
  - Total for Robert = $50 + $20 = $70
* Teddy's order:
  - 6 hamburgers at $3 each = 6 x $3 = $18
  - 10 cans of soft drinks at $2 each = 10 x $2 = $20
  - Total for Teddy = $18 + $20 = $38
* Total spent by Robert and Teddy:
  - $70 + $38 = $108

Answer: 108
