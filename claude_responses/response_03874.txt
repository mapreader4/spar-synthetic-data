Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sara makes 4 cakes per day during the 5 weekdays
* That means she makes 4 cakes x 5 days = 20 cakes per week
* In 4 weeks, she makes 20 cakes x 4 weeks = 80 cakes
* She sells each cake for $8
* To calculate the total money she collected, we multiply the number of cakes (80) by the price per cake ($8)
* 80 cakes x $8 per cake = $640

Answer: $640
