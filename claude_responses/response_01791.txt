Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are a total of 36 delegates at the convention
* 16 of the 36 delegates arrived with pre-printed name badges
* That means 36 - 16 = 20 delegates did not have pre-printed name badges
* Half of the 20 delegates without pre-printed name badges made their own, hand-written name badges
* So, 20 / 2 = 10 delegates made their own name badges
* That means the remaining delegates who did not have any name badges is 20 - 10 = 10 delegates

Answer: 10
