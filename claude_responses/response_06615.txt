Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pete received $2.50 from his grandmother
* Pete spent 4 nickels, which is 4 x $0.05 = $0.20
* So Pete saved $2.50 - $0.20 = $2.30

* Raymond received $2.50 from his grandmother
* Raymond has 7 dimes left, which is 7 x $0.10 = $0.70
* So Raymond spent $2.50 - $0.70 = $1.80

* The total amount spent by Pete and Raymond is $0.20 + $1.80 = $2.00
