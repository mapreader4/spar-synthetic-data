Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The average speed for an hour drive is 66 miles per hour
* Felix wants to drive twice as fast for 4 hours
* To find the distance covered, we need to multiply the speed by the time
* The original speed is 66 miles per hour
* Felix wants to drive twice as fast, so his new speed is 66 * 2 = 132 miles per hour
* He wants to drive for 4 hours
* So the distance covered is 132 miles per hour * 4 hours = 528 miles

Answer: 528
