Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Patty agrees to give her siblings 3 cookies for every chore they do
* Each kid normally has 4 chores per week
* Patty has $15 to buy cookies
* Each pack of cookies contains 24 cookies and costs $3

First, let's calculate how many cookies Patty can buy with her $15:
* $15 / $3 per pack = 5 packs of cookies
* 5 packs x 24 cookies per pack = 120 cookies

Now, let's calculate how many chores her siblings can do in exchange for cookies:
* 3 cookies per chore
* 120 cookies / 3 cookies per chore = 40 chores

Finally, let's calculate how many weeks Patty can go without doing chores:
* Each kid has 4 chores per week
* 40 chores / 4 chores per kid per week = 10 weeks

Answer: 10 weeks
