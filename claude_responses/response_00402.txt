Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The movie made $120 million in its opening weekend.
2) The movie ended up making 3.5 times that much during its entire run. 
3) 3.5 * $120 million = $420 million total revenue for the entire run of the movie.
4) The production company gets to keep 60% of the total revenue.
5) 60% of $420 million = 0.6 * $420 million = $252 million.
6) The movie cost $60 million to produce.
7) The profit made by the production company is the total revenue they kept ($252 million) minus the cost to produce the movie ($60 million).
8) $252 million - $60 million = $192 million.

Answer: $192 million
