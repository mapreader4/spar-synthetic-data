Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Travis and his brother collected 68 pieces of candy altogether.
2) Each of them ate 4 pieces of candy after the event.
3) To find the number of pieces of candy left, we need to subtract the number of pieces they ate from the total number of pieces they collected.
4) The number of pieces they ate is 4 (pieces) x 2 (people) = 8 pieces.
5) The total number of pieces of candy left is 68 (total pieces collected) - 8 (pieces eaten) = 60 pieces.

Answer: 60
