Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* We are given that a 25 m roll of wire weighs 5 kg.
* We want to find the weight of a 75 m roll of wire.
* To do this, we can set up a proportion:
* 25 m of wire = 5 kg
* 75 m of wire = x kg
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 25x = 75 * 5
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = (75 * 5) / 25
* x = 15 kg

Answer: 15 kg
