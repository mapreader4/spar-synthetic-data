Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tenisha had 40 dogs in total.
2) 60% of the dogs are female. To find the number of female dogs, we take 60% of 40:
   * 60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 female dogs
3) 3/4 of the female dogs gave birth to 10 puppies each. To find the number of puppies born, we take 3/4 of 24 and multiply by 10:
   * 3/4 of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 female dogs gave birth
   * 18 female dogs * 10 puppies each = 180 puppies born
4) Tenisha donated 130 puppies to the church.
5) To find the total number of puppies Tenisha remains with, we take the total number of puppies born (180) and subtract the 130 puppies donated:
   * 180 puppies - 130 puppies = 50 puppies

Answer: 50
