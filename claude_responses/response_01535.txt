Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janine read 5 books last month
* This month, she read twice as many books, which is 2 x 5 = 10 books
* Each book has 10 pages
* To calculate the total number of pages read in two months:
  - Last month: 5 books x 10 pages per book = 50 pages
  - This month: 10 books x 10 pages per book = 100 pages
  - Total pages read in two months: 50 + 100 = 150 pages

Answer: 150
