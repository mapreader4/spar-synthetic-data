Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each lollipop uses 5ml of food colouring
* The candy store makes 100 lollipops in a day
* So the total amount of food colouring used for the lollipops is:
  * 100 lollipops x 5ml per lollipop = 500ml
* The candy store also makes 5 hard candies
* We know the total amount of food colouring used in a day is 600ml
* So the amount of food colouring used for the hard candies must be:
  * 600ml total - 500ml for lollipops = 100ml for hard candies
* Since there are 5 hard candies, we can divide the 100ml by 5 to get the amount of food colouring per hard candy:
  * 100ml / 5 hard candies = 20ml per hard candy

Answer: 20ml
