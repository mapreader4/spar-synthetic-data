Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kim drinks a 1.5-quart bottle of water.
2) 1 quart = 32 ounces.
3) 1.5 quarts = 1.5 * 32 = 48 ounces.
4) Kim then drinks a 12 ounce can of water.
5) The total amount of water Kim drank is the sum of the 48 ounces from the 1.5-quart bottle and the 12 ounces from the can.
6) 48 ounces + 12 ounces = 60 ounces.

Answer: 60 ounces.
