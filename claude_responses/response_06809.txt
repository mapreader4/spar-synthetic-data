Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry is paid $40 per task
* Each task takes him 2 hours to complete
* He works 10 hours a day
* He works for a whole week (7 days)

First, let's calculate how many tasks he can complete in a day:
* 10 hours of work per day / 2 hours per task = 5 tasks per day

Next, let's calculate how many tasks he can complete in a week:
* 5 tasks per day x 7 days = 35 tasks per week

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money he would earn:
* 35 tasks per week x $40 per task = $1,400

Answer: $1,400
