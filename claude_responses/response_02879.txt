Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Malcolm brushes his teeth for 2 minutes after each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner)
* There are 3 meals per day
* So, Malcolm brushes his teeth for a total of 2 minutes x 3 meals = 6 minutes per day
* After 30 days, the total time spent brushing his teeth is:
* 6 minutes per day x 30 days = 180 minutes
* To convert this to hours, we divide 180 minutes by 60 minutes per hour:
* 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours

Answer: 3 hours
