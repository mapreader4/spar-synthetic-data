Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Zoo entry tickets are $5 per person.
2) Bus fare is $1.50 per person one way, so $3 per person round-trip.
3) Noah and Ava are going to the zoo, so that's 2 people.
4) The total cost for zoo entry and bus fare is:
   - Zoo entry: 2 people x $5 = $10
   - Bus fare: 2 people x $3 = $6
   - Total cost: $10 + $6 = $16
5) They have $40 to start with.
6) The amount of money they have left to spend on lunch and snacks is:
   - $40 - $16 = $24

Answer: $24
