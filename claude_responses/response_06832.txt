Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Juan takes half the time to grab his lunch from his office and back, compared to the time it takes him to read a book.
* If he takes 4 hours to move from his office to grab lunch, then the time it takes him to read the book is 8 hours (4 hours x 2).
* The book has 4000 pages.
* To find the number of pages he reads in an hour, we divide the total number of pages (4000) by the total time it takes him to read the book (8 hours).

Answer: 500 pages
