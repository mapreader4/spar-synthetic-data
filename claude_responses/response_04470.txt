Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim buys a cabinet for $1200
* He gets a 15% discount on the cabinet
* To calculate the discount amount, we take 15% of $1200:
    * 15% of $1200 = 0.15 x $1200 = $180
* To calculate the final amount Tim paid, we subtract the discount from the original price:
    * $1200 - $180 = $1020
Answer: $1020
