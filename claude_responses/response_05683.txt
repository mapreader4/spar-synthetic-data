Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 4 runners ran a combined total of 195 miles last week
* Katarina ran 51 miles
* Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet all ran the same distance

To find the distance Harriet ran, we need to first find the distance that Tomas and Tyler ran.

We know that the 4 runners ran a combined total of 195 miles, and that Katarina ran 51 miles.
* The remaining 3 runners (Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet) ran a combined total of 195 - 51 = 144 miles.

Since Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet all ran the same distance, we can divide the 144 miles by 3 to find the distance each of them ran:
* 144 / 3 = 48 miles

Therefore, Harriet ran 48 miles.

Answer: 48
