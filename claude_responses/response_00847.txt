Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The farmer spent a total of $50 + $35 + $15 = $100 on the cultivation of the corn.
2) The farmer was able to gather 10 bags of corn.
3) To make a 10% profit, the farmer needs to sell each bag of corn for a price that is 10% higher than the total cost per bag.
4) The total cost per bag is the total cost ($100) divided by the number of bags (10), which is $10 per bag.
5) To make a 10% profit, the farmer should sell each bag for 110% of the cost per bag, which is $10 x 1.10 = $11 per bag.

Answer: $11
