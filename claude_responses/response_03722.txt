Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Jorge is 16 years old in 2005.
2) We also know that Jorge is 24 years younger than Simon.
3) So, in 2005, Simon's age would be 16 + 24 = 40 years old.
4) Now, we need to find out how old Simon would be in 2010.
5) Since 2010 is 5 years after 2005, Simon's age in 2010 would be 40 + 5 = 45 years old.

Answer: 45
