Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The bag initially has:
  - 7 apples
  - 8 oranges
  - 15 mangoes
* Luisa takes out:
  - 2 apples
  - Twice as many oranges as apples, which is 2 x 2 = 4 oranges
  - 2/3 the number of mangoes, which is 2/3 x 15 = 10 mangoes
* After Luisa's removal, the remaining number of fruits in the bag is:
  - Apples: 7 - 2 = 5
  - Oranges: 8 - 4 = 4
  - Mangoes: 15 - 10 = 5
* The total remaining number of fruits in the bag is:
  - 5 apples + 4 oranges + 5 mangoes = 14 fruits
