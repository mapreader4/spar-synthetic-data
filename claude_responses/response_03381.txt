Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 shirts in total
* 3 of the shirts cost $15 each
* The remaining 2 shirts cost $20 each
* To calculate the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the 3 shirts at $15 each and the cost of the 2 shirts at $20 each.

Cost of the 3 shirts at $15 each:
* 3 shirts x $15 per shirt = $45

Cost of the 2 shirts at $20 each:
* 2 shirts x $20 per shirt = $40

Total cost of all 5 shirts:
* $45 + $40 = $85

Answer: $85
