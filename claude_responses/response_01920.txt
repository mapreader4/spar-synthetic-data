Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Blanch starts with 15 slices of pizza in the fridge
* For breakfast, she eats 4 slices
* So after breakfast, she has 15 - 4 = 11 slices left
* At lunch, she eats 2 slices
* So after lunch, she has 11 - 2 = 9 slices left
* As a snack, she eats 2 more slices
* So after the snack, she has 9 - 2 = 7 slices left
* For dinner, she eats 5 more slices
* So after dinner, she has 7 - 5 = 2 slices left
