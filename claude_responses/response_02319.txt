Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Mayer bought Corgi dogs for $1000 each.
2) He plans to sell them with a 30% profit.
3) To calculate the selling price, we take the cost price ($1000) and add the 30% profit:
   * Profit = 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300
   * Selling price = Cost price + Profit = $1000 + $300 = $1300 per dog
4) His friend wants to buy 2 dogs.
5) Therefore, the total amount his friend should pay is:
   * 2 dogs x $1300 per dog = $2600

Answer: $2600
