Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Ronald has rolled the following numbers: 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 3, 4, 4, 2
2) The sum of all the rolls is 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 31
3) The number of rolls so far is 10
4) The average of all the rolls so far is 31 / 10 = 3.1
5) To get the average to be exactly 3, Ronald needs the sum of all the rolls to be 30 (since 30 / 11 = 2.73)
6) So the next roll needs to be a 2 to get the total to 31 + 2 = 33, and the average to be 33 / 11 = 3.
