Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Yasmin deposited a $50 birthday check from her grandmother
* The check was worth a quarter of her new balance after the check money is added
* We need to find how many dollars were in her account before she deposited the check

First, let's call the amount in her account before the deposit as 'x'.
* After the $50 check is deposited, the new balance is x + 50
* The check is worth a quarter of the new balance, so:
* $50 = 1/4 * (x + 50)
* Solving for x, we get:
* $50 = 1/4 * x + 12.5
* $37.5 = 1/4 * x
* x = $150

Therefore, the amount in Yasmin's account before she deposited the $50 check was $150.

Answer: $150
