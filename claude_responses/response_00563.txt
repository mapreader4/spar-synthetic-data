Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 84 people waiting in line to ride the roller coaster.
2) Each car on the roller coaster seats 2 people.
3) There are 7 cars on the roller coaster.
4) To calculate how many people can ride in one round of the roller coaster, we multiply the number of cars (7) by the number of people per car (2):
7 cars x 2 people per car = 14 people per round.
5) To determine how many times the ride operator will need to run the roller coaster to give everyone in line a turn, we divide the total number of people in line (84) by the number of people who can ride per round (14):
84 people / 14 people per round = 6 rounds.
