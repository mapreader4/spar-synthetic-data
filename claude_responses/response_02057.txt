Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* Jack weighs 60 pounds
* Anna weighs 40 pounds
* The goal is to make their weights equal
* To do this, Jack needs to add weight to his side of the see-saw
* Each rock weighs 4 pounds
* We need to find how many 4-pound rocks Jack needs to add to make the total weight on his side equal to Anna's weight of 40 pounds

To calculate the number of rocks, we need to find the difference between Jack's weight and Anna's weight, and then divide that difference by the weight of each rock.

The difference between their weights is:
* 60 pounds - 40 pounds = 20 pounds

Since each rock weighs 4 pounds, we divide the 20-pound difference by 4 to get the number of rocks needed:
* 20 pounds / 4 pounds per rock = 5 rocks

Answer: 5
