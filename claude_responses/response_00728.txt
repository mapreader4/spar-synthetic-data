Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Whitney's mom gave her two $20 bills, which is a total of $40.
* Whitney wants to buy:
  - 2 posters at $5 each, so 2 x $5 = $10
  - 3 notebooks at $4 each, so 3 x $4 = $12
  - 2 bookmarks at $2 each, so 2 x $2 = $4
* The total cost of the items Whitney wants to buy is $10 + $12 + $4 = $26.
* To find the amount of money Whitney will have left over, we take the total amount she was given ($40) and subtract the total cost of the items she wants to buy ($26).
* $40 - $26 = $14.
