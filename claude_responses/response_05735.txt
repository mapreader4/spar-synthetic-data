Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The stadium has a total capacity of 2000 people.
2. The total number of people in the stadium is 3/4 of the total capacity, which means there are 3/4 * 2000 = 1500 people in the stadium.
3. Each person paid $20 in entry fees.
4. The total amount of fees collected when the stadium was 3/4 full is 1500 * $20 = $30,000.
5. If the stadium would have been full, the total number of people would be 2000.
6. The total amount of fees collected if the stadium was full would be 2000 * $20 = $40,000.
7. The difference between the total amount of fees collected when the stadium was 3/4 full and if the stadium would have been full is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Answer: $10,000
