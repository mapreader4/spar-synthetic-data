Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lizzy's mother gave her 80 cents
* Her father gave her 40 cents
* She spent 50 cents buying candy for her little cousin
* Her uncle gave her 70 cents

First, we add the money she received from her mother and father:
* 80 cents + 40 cents = 120 cents

Next, we subtract the 50 cents she spent on candy:
* 120 cents - 50 cents = 70 cents

Finally, we add the 70 cents she received from her uncle:
* 70 cents + 70 cents = 140 cents

Answer: 140 cents
