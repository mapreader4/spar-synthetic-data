Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sasha added 48 cards into the box.
2) Karen then took out 1/6 of the cards that Sasha added.
3) To find how many cards Karen took out, we take 1/6 of 48, which is 8 cards.
4) So, after Karen took out 8 cards, there are 48 - 8 = 40 cards left in the box.
5) The question states that there are now 83 cards in the box.
6) To find the original number of cards in the box, we add the 40 cards left after Karen's removal to the 8 cards she took out, which gives us 40 + 8 = 48 cards.

Answer: 48
