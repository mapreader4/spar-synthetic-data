Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Draymond earned 12 points
* Curry earned twice the points as Draymond, so Curry earned 2 * 12 = 24 points
* Kelly earned 9 points
* Durant earned twice the points as Kelly, so Durant earned 2 * 9 = 18 points
* Klay earned half the points as Draymond, so Klay earned 1/2 * 12 = 6 points

Now, to find the total points earned by the Golden State team, we add up the points earned by each player:
* Total points = Draymond's points + Curry's points + Kelly's points + Durant's points + Klay's points
* Total points = 12 + 24 + 9 + 18 + 6 = 69

Answer: 69
