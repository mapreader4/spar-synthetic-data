Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 50 candies left in the bowl after Shelly ate 20 candies the previous week.
2) Shelly's friend brings twice as much candy as Shelly originally had, which means she brought 40 candies (2 x 20 = 40).
3) Shelly adds the 40 candies from her friend to the 50 candies already in the bowl, so now there are 50 + 40 = 90 candies in the bowl.
4) They decide to divide the 90 candies equally, so each person gets 90 / 2 = 45 candies.
5) Shelly's friend then eats 10 of her 45 candies.
6) So, after eating 10 of her candies, Shelly's friend has 45 - 10 = 35 candies left.

Answer: 35
