Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Irene earns $500 for working 40 hours a week
* She gets an extra $20 for every hour of overtime
* Last week, she worked 50 hours

First, let's calculate her base pay for 40 hours:
* Base pay = $500

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay:
* Overtime hours = 50 hours - 40 hours = 10 hours
* Overtime pay = 10 hours x $20 = $200

Finally, let's calculate her total income:
* Total income = Base pay + Overtime pay
* Total income = $500 + $200 = $700

Answer: $700
