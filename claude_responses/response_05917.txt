Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Harly's animal shelter initially has 80 dogs.
2) She adopts out 40% of the 80 dogs. 40% of 80 is 0.4 * 80 = 32 dogs.
3) So, after adopting out 32 dogs, she has 80 - 32 = 48 dogs remaining.
4) However, she then has to take back 5 dogs due to personality conflicts.
5) So, the final number of dogs she has now is 48 + 5 = 53 dogs.

Answer: 53
