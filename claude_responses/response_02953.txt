Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adam eats 3 more pies than Bill
2) Sierra eats twice as many pies as Bill
3) Sierra ate 12 pies
4) Since Sierra eats twice as many pies as Bill, we can say that Bill ate 6 pies (12 / 2 = 6)
5) Since Adam eats 3 more pies than Bill, we can say that Adam ate 9 pies (6 + 3 = 9)
6) To find the total number of pies eaten, we add up the pies eaten by Adam, Bill, and Sierra:
   Adam: 9 pies
   Bill: 6 pies
   Sierra: 12 pies
   Total: 9 + 6 + 12 = 27 pies

Answer: 27
