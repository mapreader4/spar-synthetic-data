Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carl starts with a jar full of marbles
* He takes out 12 marbles to play a game
* He accidentally drops them and 1/2 of the 12 marbles get lost
* So, 1/2 of 12 = 6 marbles are lost
* Carl then takes out 10 more marbles to play the game
* Carl's mother brings home a bag of 25 new marbles

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Carl will put in the jar after playing his game:
* Originally, Carl had 12 marbles, but 6 were lost, so he has 12 - 6 = 6 marbles left from the original 12
* He then took out 10 more marbles to play the game
* His mother brought home 25 new marbles
* So the total number of marbles Carl will put in the jar is:
* 6 (remaining from original 12) + 10 (additional marbles taken out) + 25 (new marbles from mother)
* = 6 + 10 + 25
* = 41

Answer: 41
