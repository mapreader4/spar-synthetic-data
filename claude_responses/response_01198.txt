Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Arthur has $200 in his wallet
* He spends four-fifths of that amount
* To calculate four-fifths of $200, we can multiply $200 by 4/5:
* $200 * 4/5 = $160
* So Arthur spent $160
* To calculate how much he has left, we take the original $200 and subtract the $160 he spent:
* $200 - $160 = $40
Answer: 40
