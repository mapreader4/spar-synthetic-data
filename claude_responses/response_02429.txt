Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bea sells her lemonade at 25 cents per glass
* Bea sold 10 glasses
* So, Bea's total earnings = 10 glasses x 25 cents per glass = 250 cents
* Dawn sells her lemonade at 28 cents per glass
* Dawn sold 8 glasses
* So, Dawn's total earnings = 8 glasses x 28 cents per glass = 224 cents
* To find how much more money Bea earned than Dawn, we subtract Dawn's earnings from Bea's earnings:
* 250 cents - 224 cents = 26 cents

Answer: 26
