Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bella received 2 dozen roses from her parents
* 1 dozen = 12 roses
* So, 2 dozen roses = 2 x 12 = 24 roses from her parents
* Bella also received 2 roses from each of her 10 dancer friends
* 2 roses x 10 friends = 20 roses from her friends
* To find the total number of roses Bella received, we add the roses from her parents and the roses from her friends:
* 24 roses (from parents) + 20 roses (from friends) = 44 roses

Answer: 44
