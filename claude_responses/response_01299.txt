Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On Tuesday, Sarah pulled 25 weeds.

2. On Wednesday, she pulled three times the number of weeds she did the day before, which is 3 x 25 = 75 weeds.

3. On Thursday, her allergies bothered her, and she could only pull up one-fifth of the weeds she pulled on the day before. That means she pulled 75 / 5 = 15 weeds.

4. On Friday, it rained for half the day, and she managed to pull up 10 fewer weeds than she did on Thursday. That means she pulled 15 - 10 = 5 weeds.

Now, let's add up the total number of weeds she pulled:
25 + 75 + 15 + 5 = 120 weeds

Answer: 120
