Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The team has 50 players
* 60% of the team are boys, which means 40% are girls
* 40% of 50 players = 0.4 * 50 = 20 girls
* Half of the girls are juniors and half are seniors
* Therefore, the number of junior girls is half of the total number of girls, which is 20 / 2 = 10
