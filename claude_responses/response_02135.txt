Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Janele has 4 cats.
2) The first two cats weigh 12 pounds each.
3) The third cat weighs 14.7 pounds.
4) The fourth cat weighs 9.3 pounds.
5) To calculate the average weight, we need to add up the weights of all the cats and divide by the total number of cats.
6) The total weight of the cats is: 12 + 12 + 14.7 + 9.3 = 48 pounds.
7) Dividing the total weight by the number of cats (4), we get: 48 / 4 = 12 pounds.

Answer: 12
