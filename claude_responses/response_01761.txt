Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kevin sells a total of 50 crates of fruit per week
* Last week, he sold 13 crates of grapes and 20 crates of mangoes
* To find the number of passion fruit crates he sold, we need to subtract the number of grapes and mangoes from the total number of crates

First, let's add up the number of grapes and mangoes:
* 13 crates of grapes + 20 crates of mangoes = 33 crates

Now, we can subtract the number of grapes and mangoes from the total number of crates to find the number of passion fruit crates:
* 50 total crates - 33 crates of grapes and mangoes = 17 crates of passion fruits

Answer: 17
