Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Weng earns $12 per hour for babysitting
* She worked for 50 minutes yesterday
* To calculate her earnings, we need to convert the 50 minutes into hours
* 50 minutes is equal to 0.833 hours (50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour)
* Now we can calculate her earnings:
* 0.833 hours x $12 per hour = $10.00
