Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Manny had 3 birthday cookie pies to share
* Each cookie pie was cut into 10 slices
* Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith each had 1 slice
* To calculate the total number of slices:
  - There were 3 cookie pies, each with 10 slices, so the total number of slices is 3 * 10 = 30 slices
  - Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith each had 1 slice, so the total number of slices taken is 26 (1 for Manny, 24 for his classmates, and 1 for Mr. Keith)
  - The number of slices left is the total number of slices (30) minus the number of slices taken (26)
