Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) A case of water contains 24 bottles.
2) The children's camp purchased 13 cases of water.
3) The first group has 14 children, the second group has 16 children, and the third group has 12 children.
4) The fourth group has half of the number of the first three groups combined, which is (14 + 16 + 12) / 2 = 21 children.
5) Each child consumes 3 bottles of water per day.
6) The camp lasts for 3 days.
7) To calculate the total number of bottles needed:
   - First group: 14 children x 3 bottles/day x 3 days = 126 bottles
   - Second group: 16 children x 3 bottles/day x 3 days = 144 bottles
   - Third group: 12 children x 3 bottles/day x 3 days = 108 bottles
   - Fourth group: 21 children x 3 bottles/day x 3 days = 189 bottles
   - Total bottles needed: 126 + 144 + 108 + 189 = 567 bottles
8) The camp purchased 13 cases, which is 13 x 24 = 312 bottles.
9) The camp still needs to buy: 567 - 312 = 255 more bottles.

Answer: 255
