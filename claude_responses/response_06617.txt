Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Last year, the cost of each opera ticket was $85.
2) This year, the cost of each opera ticket is $102.
3) To calculate the percent increase, we use the formula:
Percent increase = (New value - Original value) / Original value x 100
4) Plugging in the values:
Percent increase = ($102 - $85) / $85 x 100
5) Simplifying the calculation:
Percent increase = $17 / $85 x 100
6) Evaluating the expression:
Percent increase = 0.2 x 100
7) Calculating the final result:
Percent increase = 20%

Answer: 20%
