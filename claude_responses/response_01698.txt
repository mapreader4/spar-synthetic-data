To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of clothes that Cally and Danny washed.

Given information:
- Cally has 10 white shirts, 5 colored shirts, 7 pairs of shorts, and 6 pairs of pants.
- Danny has 6 white shirts, 8 colored shirts, 10 shorts, and 6 pairs of pants.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of clothes Cally washed.
Cally's clothes = 10 white shirts + 5 colored shirts + 7 pairs of shorts + 6 pairs of pants
Cally's clothes = 10 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 28 clothes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of clothes Danny washed.
Danny's clothes = 6 white shirts + 8 colored shirts + 10 shorts + 6 pairs of pants
Danny's clothes = 6 + 8 + 10 + 6 = 30 clothes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of clothes Cally and Danny washed.
Total clothes washed = Cally's clothes + Danny's clothes
Total clothes washed = 28 + 30 = 58 clothes

Answer: 58
