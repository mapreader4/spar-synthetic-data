Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Susan had a sum of money at the start.
2) In September, she spent 1/5 of this money.
3) In October, she spent 1/4 of this money.
4) In November, she spent $120.
5) After these expenses, she had $540 left.
6) Let's call the initial sum of money that Susan had "x".
7) In September, she spent 1/5 of x, which is 0.2x.
8) In October, she spent 1/4 of x, which is 0.25x.
9) In November, she spent $120.
10) The total amount she spent is 0.2x + 0.25x + $120 = 0.45x + $120.
11) The amount she had left is $540.
12) So, 0.45x + $120 = $540.
13) Solving for x, we get x = $940.

Answer: 940
