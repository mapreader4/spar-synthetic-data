Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Aisha starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player.
2. The week after that, she adds another 500 songs, so now she has 500 + 500 = 1000 songs.
3. She then adds twice the amount she already had, which is 2 x 1000 = 2000 songs. So now she has 1000 + 2000 = 3000 songs.
4. Finally, she removes 50 songs that she doesn't like. So the final number of songs on her mp3 player is 3000 - 50 = 2950 songs.

Answer: 2950
