Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have 3 people: Jim, Jane, and Jerry.
2) Jim has 20 apples, Jane has 60 apples, and Jerry has 40 apples.
3) To find the average amount of apples per person, we add up the total number of apples and divide by the number of people:
Total apples = 20 + 60 + 40 = 120
Number of people = 3
Average apples per person = 120 / 3 = 40
4) Now we need to find how many times Jim's 20 apples can fit into the average of 40 apples per person.
5) 40 apples / 20 apples per person = 2
