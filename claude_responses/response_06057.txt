Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each tree has 10 branches
* Each branch has 40 sub-branches
* Each sub-branch has 60 leaves
* So, each tree has:
    - 10 branches
    - 40 sub-branches per branch
    - 60 leaves per sub-branch
    - Therefore, each tree has 10 * 40 * 60 = 24,000 leaves
* There are 4 trees on the farm
* Therefore, the total number of leaves on all the trees is:
    - 4 trees * 24,000 leaves per tree = 96,000 leaves

Answer: 96,000
