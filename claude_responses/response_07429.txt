Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 28 students in the class
* Two-sevenths of the students were absent last Monday
* To find the number of students absent, we need to calculate two-sevenths of 28:
* 2/7 * 28 = 8 students were absent
* To find the number of students present, we need to subtract the number of students absent from the total number of students:
* 28 - 8 = 20 students were present

Answer: 20
