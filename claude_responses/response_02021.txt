Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alaya's restaurant has 200 fruit salads.
2) Angel's restaurant makes twice the number of fruit salads as Alaya's restaurant.
3) To find the number of fruit salads in Angel's restaurant, we multiply Alaya's 200 fruit salads by 2:
200 x 2 = 400 fruit salads in Angel's restaurant.
4) To find the total number of fruit salads in both restaurants, we add the number of fruit salads in each restaurant:
200 + 400 = 600 fruit salads.

Answer: 600
