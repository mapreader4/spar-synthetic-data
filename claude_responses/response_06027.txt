Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The family initially had 10 eggs.
2) The mother used 5 of those eggs to make an omelet.
3) So, the family now has 10 - 5 = 5 eggs.
4) Then, 2 chickens laid 3 eggs each, which is 2 * 3 = 6 more eggs.
5) So, the family now has the original 5 eggs, plus the 6 new eggs, for a total of 5 + 6 = 11 eggs.
