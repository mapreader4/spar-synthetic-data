Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 180 students in ninth grade.
2) 1/4 of them bombed their finals because they were going through difficult breakups. 1/4 of 180 is 45 students.
3) So, the remaining number of students who did not bomb their finals is 180 - 45 = 135 students.
4) 1/3 of the remaining 135 students didn't show up to take the test. 1/3 of 135 is 45 students.
5) So, the remaining number of students who took the test is 135 - 45 = 90 students.
6) Another 20 students got less than a D.
7) Therefore, the number of students who passed their finals is 90 - 20 = 70 students.

Answer: 70 students.
