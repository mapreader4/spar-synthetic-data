Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that Jason eats 3 potatoes in 20 minutes.
2) We want to find out how long it would take him to eat all 27 potatoes.
3) To do this, we need to find the rate at which Jason eats potatoes.
4) The rate is 3 potatoes / 20 minutes = 0.15 potatoes per minute.
5) To find the time it would take to eat 27 potatoes, we divide 27 by the rate:
27 potatoes / 0.15 potatoes per minute = 180 minutes.
6) Converting 180 minutes to hours, we get 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Answer: 3 hours.
