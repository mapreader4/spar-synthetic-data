Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Melanie starts with an 8-ounce wheel of brie cheese
* 1 pound loaf of bread
* 1 pound of tomatoes
* 2 pounds of zucchini
* 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts
* 8 ounces of fresh raspberries
* 8 ounces of fresh blueberries

To calculate the total pounds of food:
* 8 ounces of brie cheese = 0.5 pounds
* 1 pound loaf of bread
* 1 pound of tomatoes
* 2 pounds of zucchini
* 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts
* 8 ounces of fresh raspberries = 0.5 pounds
* 8 ounces of fresh blueberries = 0.5 pounds

Adding these up:
0.5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 7 pounds

Answer: 7 pounds
