Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexa and Emily spent $10 for lemons, $5 for sugar, and $3 for cups, which totals $18 in expenses.
* They sold 21 cups of lemonade at $4 per cup, which means their total revenue is 21 * $4 = $84.
* To calculate their profit, we take the total revenue and subtract the total expenses:
* Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
* Profit = $84 - $18 = $66

Answer: $66
