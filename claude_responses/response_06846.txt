Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Giselle has $120
* Isabella has $45 more than Sam
* Isabella has $15 more than Giselle
* So, if Giselle has $120, then Isabella has $120 + $15 = $135
* And if Isabella has $135, then Sam has $135 - $45 = $90

Now, we need to find the total amount of money that Isabella, Sam, and Giselle have:
* Total money = $135 + $90 + $120 = $345

The three shoppers at the local town's supermarket will share this money equally, so we need to divide the total money by 3:
* $345 / 3 = $115

Answer: $115
