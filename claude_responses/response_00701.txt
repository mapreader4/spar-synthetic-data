Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kim buys 3 pizzas
* Each pizza has 12 slices
* The total cost of the 3 pizzas is $72

First, we need to find the cost per pizza:
* Total cost of 3 pizzas = $72
* Cost per pizza = $72 / 3 = $24

Next, we need to find the cost per slice:
* Each pizza has 12 slices
* Total number of slices = 3 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = 36 slices
* Cost per slice = $72 / 36 slices = $2 per slice

Finally, to find the cost of 5 slices:
* Cost of 5 slices = 5 slices x $2 per slice = $10

Answer: $10
