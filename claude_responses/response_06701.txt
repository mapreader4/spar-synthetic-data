Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* From Sunday to Thursday, Prudence sleeps 6 hours a night.
* That's 5 nights per week, and 6 hours per night, so that's 5 x 6 = 30 hours of sleep per week.
* Friday and Saturday, she sleeps for 9 hours a night.
* That's 2 nights per week, and 9 hours per night, so that's 2 x 9 = 18 hours of sleep per week.
* She also takes a 1-hour nap on Saturday and Sunday.
* That's 2 hours of nap time per week.
* So the total sleep per week is 30 + 18 + 2 = 50 hours.
* In 4 weeks, that's 4 x 50 = 200 hours of sleep.

Answer: 200 hours
