Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mille has 64 pretzels.
2) She has four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so that's 4 x 64 = 256 goldfish.
3) She also has 32 suckers.
4) In total, she has 64 + 256 + 32 = 352 items.
5) She is dividing these 352 items into baggies for 16 kids.
6) To find the number of items in each baggie, we divide the total number of items (352) by the number of kids (16).
7) 352 / 16 = 22.

Answer: 22
