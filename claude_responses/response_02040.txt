Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Phil and Andre ordered a small cheese pizza with 8 slices and a large pepperoni pizza with 14 slices.
* They have both eaten 9 slices already.
* To find the number of slices left per person, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of slices in both pizzas:
   * Small pizza: 8 slices
   * Large pizza: 14 slices
   * Total slices: 8 + 14 = 22 slices
2. Subtract the 9 slices they have already eaten:
   * 22 slices - 9 slices = 13 slices left
3. Divide the remaining 13 slices evenly between Phil and Andre:
   * 13 slices / 2 people = 6.5 slices per person

Since we cannot have a half slice, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 6 slices per person.
