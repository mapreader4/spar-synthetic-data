Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The church has a total of 120 members
* 40% of the members are adults
* The remaining members are children

To find the number of adults:
* 40% of 120 = 0.40 x 120 = 48 adults

To find the number of children:
* Total members - adults = children
* 120 - 48 = 72 children

To find the difference between the number of children and adults:
* Children - adults = 72 - 48 = 24 more children than adults

Answer: 24
