Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The area of a triangle is given by the formula: 1/2 * base * height
2) We are given that the height of the triangle is 8 units
3) We are also given that the area of the triangle is 24 square units
4) Plugging in the values, we get:
1/2 * base * 8 = 24
5) Solving for the base, we get:
base = 24 / (1/2 * 8)
base = 24 / 4
base = 6 units

Answer: 6
