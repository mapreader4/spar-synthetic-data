Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gwen received a $900 bonus
2) She invested one-third of the bonus in stock A, one-third in stock B, and one-third in stock C
3) One-third of $900 is $300, so she invested $300 in each stock
4) After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value
5) Stock A and stock B were each worth $600 (2 x $300) at the end of the year
6) Stock C had lost half of its value, so it was worth $150 (0.5 x $300) at the end of the year
7) Adding up the values of the three stocks, Gwen's total stock value at the end of the year was:
$600 + $600 + $150 = $1,350

Answer: $1,350
