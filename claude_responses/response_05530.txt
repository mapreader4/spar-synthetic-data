Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Simon picks 100 blueberries from his own bushes
* He picks another 200 blueberries from nearby bushes
* So the total number of blueberries he has picked is 100 + 200 = 300 blueberries
* Each pie needs 100 blueberries
* To find how many pies he can make, we divide the total number of blueberries by the number of blueberries needed per pie:
* 300 blueberries / 100 blueberries per pie = 3 pies
