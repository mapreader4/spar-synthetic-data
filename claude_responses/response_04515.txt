Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Two days ago, Oliver's shop washed a total of 5 kilos of laundry.
2. Yesterday, the shop washed 5 kilos more than the previous day, which means it washed 5 + 5 = 10 kilos of laundry.
3. Today, the shop washed twice the number of kilos than yesterday, which means it washed 10 x 2 = 20 kilos of laundry.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of laundry washed over the three days:
* Total laundry washed = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 kilos

Oliver charges $2 per kilo of laundry, so the total amount he earned over the three days is:
* Total earnings = 35 kilos x $2 per kilo = $70

Answer: $70
