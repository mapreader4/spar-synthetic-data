Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elena has 8 lilies in her garden
* Each lily has 6 petals
* So, the total number of petals from the lilies is:
  * 8 lilies x 6 petals per lily = 48 petals
* Elena also has 5 tulips in her garden
* Each tulip has 3 petals
* So, the total number of petals from the tulips is:
  * 5 tulips x 3 petals per tulip = 15 petals
* To find the total number of flower petals in Elena's garden, we add the petals from the lilies and the tulips:
  * 48 petals + 15 petals = 63 petals

Answer: 63
