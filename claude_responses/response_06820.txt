Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jade had to drive 8 hours each day for 3 days
* So Jade's total driving time was 8 hours x 3 days = 24 hours
* Krista had to drive 6 hours each day for 3 days
* So Krista's total driving time was 6 hours x 3 days = 18 hours
* To find the total driving time for both Jade and Krista, we add their individual driving times:
* 24 hours (Jade) + 18 hours (Krista) = 42 hours

Answer: 42
