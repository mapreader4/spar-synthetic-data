Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Andrea needs 45 rhinestones to finish the art project.
2) She bought a third of what she needed. A third of 45 is 45 / 3 = 15 rhinestones.
3) She found a fifth of what she needed in her supplies. A fifth of 45 is 45 / 5 = 9 rhinestones.
4) So the total number of rhinestones she has is 15 + 9 = 24 rhinestones.
5) To find how many more she needs, we take the total she needs (45) and subtract the total she has (24).
Answer: 45 - 24 = 21 rhinestones.
