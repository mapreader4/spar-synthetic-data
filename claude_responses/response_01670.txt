Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The basket can hold 40 fruit altogether.
2) There are 3 times as many apples as oranges.
3) Let's say there are x oranges in the basket.
4) Since there are 3 times as many apples as oranges, the number of apples must be 3x.
5) The total number of fruit in the basket is 40, which is the sum of the apples and oranges.
6) So we can write the equation: x + 3x = 40
7) Solving for x, we get: 4x = 40
8) Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 10
9) Therefore, the number of oranges in the basket is 10.

Answer: 10
