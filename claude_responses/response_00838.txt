Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The boat was carrying 20 sheep, 10 cows, and 14 dogs
* 3 of the sheep drowned
* Twice as many cows drowned as did sheep, so 2 x 3 = 6 cows drowned
* All of the dogs made it to shore

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals that made it to shore:
* Sheep that made it to shore: 20 - 3 = 17
* Cows that made it to shore: 10 - 6 = 4
* Dogs that made it to shore: 14

Adding these up, we get:
* Total animals that made it to shore = 17 + 4 + 14 = 35

Answer: 35
