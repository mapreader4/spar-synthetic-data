Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Haylee has 3 dozen guppies, which is 3 x 12 = 36 guppies.
2) Jose has half as many guppies as Haylee, which is 36 / 2 = 18 guppies.
3) Charliz has one-third of what Jose has, which is 18 / 3 = 6 guppies.
4) Nicolai has 4 times as many guppies as Charliz, which is 6 x 4 = 24 guppies.
5) To find the total number of guppies the four friends have altogether, we add up the individual amounts:
36 + 18 + 6 + 24 = 84 guppies.

Answer: 84
