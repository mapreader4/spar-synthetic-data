Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carter goes through 5 sets of drum sticks per show
* After each show, he tosses 6 new sets of drum sticks to the audience
* He does this for 30 nights straight

First, let's calculate how many sets of drum sticks he goes through during the 30 shows:
* 5 sets per show x 30 shows = 150 sets of drum sticks

Next, let's calculate how many sets of drum sticks he tosses to the audience:
* 6 sets per show x 30 shows = 180 sets of drum sticks

Now, we can add the two numbers together to get the total number of sets of drum sticks he goes through:
* 150 sets + 180 sets = 330 sets of drum sticks

Answer: 330
