Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The book has 120 pages
* Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages
* Today, Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday, which is 2 x 12 = 24 pages
* So, the total number of pages she has read so far is 12 + 24 = 36 pages
* The remaining pages in the book are 120 - 36 = 84 pages
* Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow
* Half of 84 is 84 / 2 = 42 pages

Answer: 42
