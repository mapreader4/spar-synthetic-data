Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) During breakfast, the restaurant had 73 customers.
2) During lunch, the restaurant had 127 customers.
3) During dinner, the restaurant had 87 customers.
4) To find the total number of customers on Friday, we add these three numbers together:
73 + 127 + 87 = 287 customers on Friday.
5) The restaurant predicts they will get twice the amount of customers on Saturday as they had on Friday.
6) To calculate the predicted number of customers on Saturday, we multiply the total number of customers on Friday by 2:
287 x 2 = 574 customers predicted for Saturday.

Answer: 574
