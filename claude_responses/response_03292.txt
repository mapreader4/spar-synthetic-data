Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The school has a deaf student population that is three times the size of the blind student population.
2) The number of deaf students is 180.
3) Since the deaf student population is three times the size of the blind student population, we can set up the following equation:
   Deaf students = 3 x Blind students
   180 = 3 x Blind students
   Blind students = 180 / 3 = 60
4) The total number of students is the sum of the deaf and blind students:
   Total students = Deaf students + Blind students
   Total students = 180 + 60 = 240

Answer: 240
