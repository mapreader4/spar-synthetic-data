Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jennifer has 2 long hair dachshunds
* It takes her 20 minutes to groom each dog
* She grooms her dogs every day
* We need to find how many hours she spends grooming her dogs in 30 days

First, let's calculate how long it takes her to groom both dogs in one day:
* 20 minutes per dog x 2 dogs = 40 minutes per day

Now, we need to convert this to hours for the 30-day period:
* 40 minutes per day x 30 days = 1,200 minutes
* 1,200 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 20 hours

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 20 hours
