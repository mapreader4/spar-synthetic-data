Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Troy had 300 straws in total.
2) He fed 3/5 of the straws to the adult pigs.
3) The remaining 2/5 of the straws were fed to the piglets.
4) The number of straws fed to the piglets is 2/5 of 300, which is 120 straws.
5) The 120 straws were divided equally among the 20 piglets.
6) To find the number of straws each piglet ate, we divide 120 by 20.
