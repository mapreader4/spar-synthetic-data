Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each class uses 200 sheets of paper per day
* The school uses a total of 9000 sheets of paper every week
* There are 5 school days in a week

First, we need to find the total number of sheets of paper used by all the classes in a week:
* 200 sheets per day x 5 days = 1000 sheets per class per week
* Since the school uses 9000 sheets per week, we can divide this by the sheets used per class per week to find the number of classes:
* 9000 sheets / 1000 sheets per class = 9 classes

Answer: 9
