Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Andrew bought 750 stickers.
2) He shared some of these stickers with his friends, Daniel and Fred.
3) Daniel received 250 stickers.
4) Fred received 120 more stickers than Daniel, which means Fred received 250 + 120 = 370 stickers.
5) To find the number of stickers Andrew kept, we need to subtract the number of stickers he gave to his friends from the total number of stickers he bought.
6) The total number of stickers he gave to his friends is 250 (to Daniel) + 370 (to Fred) = 620.
7) So the number of stickers Andrew kept is 750 - 620 = 130.

Answer: 130
