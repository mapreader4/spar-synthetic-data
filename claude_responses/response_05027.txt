Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Collin found 12 cans at home.
2) He found three times as many cans at his grandparents' house, which is 3 x 12 = 36 cans.
3) His neighbor gave him 46 cans.
4) His dad brought home 250 cans from the office.
5) In total, Collin has 12 + 36 + 46 + 250 = 344 cans.
6) Each can is worth $0.25, so the total amount of money Collin earned is 344 x $0.25 = $86.
7) Collin has to put half of the $86 into savings, which is $86 / 2 = $43.

Answer: $43.
