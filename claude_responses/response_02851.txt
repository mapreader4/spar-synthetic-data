Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Aaron, Henry's brother, is 15 years old.
2) Henry's sister is three times as old as Aaron. 
   * So, Henry's sister's age = 3 x 15 = 45 years old.
3) Henry is four times as old as his sister.
   * So, Henry's age = 4 x 45 = 180 years old.
4) To find the combined age of the siblings, we add up the ages of Aaron, Henry's sister, and Henry:
   * Combined age = 15 + 45 + 180 = 240 years old.

Answer: 240
