Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total amount of sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday was $80.
* 2/5 of the total amount of sales were credit sales.
* The remaining amount were cash sales.

To find the amount of cash sales, we need to first find the amount of credit sales.

The amount of credit sales is 2/5 of the total sales, which is:
* 2/5 x $80 = $32

The amount of cash sales is the remaining amount, which is the total sales minus the credit sales:
* $80 - $32 = $48

Therefore, the amount Mr. Brandon got from cash sales is:
Answer: $48
