Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The museum has 8 different wings
* 3 of the wings are dedicated to paintings
* The remaining 5 wings are dedicated to artifacts
* The museum has 4 times as many artifacts as paintings
* The two wings with smaller paintings have 12 paintings each
* The one wing with the large painting has 1 painting

First, let's find out how many paintings are in the museum:
* 2 wings with 12 paintings each = 24 paintings
* 1 wing with 1 large painting = 1 painting
* Total paintings = 24 + 1 = 25 paintings

Now, we know that the museum has 4 times as many artifacts as paintings, so:
* Total artifacts = 4 * 25 = 100 artifacts

The artifacts are divided evenly among the remaining 5 wings, so:
* Artifacts per artifact wing = 100 / 5 = 20 artifacts

Answer: 20 artifacts
