Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Adam has 7 goats.
2) Andrew has 5 more than twice as many goats as Adam. 
   * Twice as many as Adam is 2 x 7 = 14 goats.
   * 5 more than 14 is 14 + 5 = 19 goats.
3) Ahmed has 6 fewer goats than Andrew.
   * Andrew has 19 goats.
   * 6 fewer than 19 is 19 - 6 = 13 goats.

Answer: 13 goats.
