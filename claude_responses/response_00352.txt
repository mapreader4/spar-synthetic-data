Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Punger buys 60 packs of baseball cards
* Each pack has 7 cards inside
* To calculate the total number of cards Punger has, we multiply the number of packs (60) by the number of cards per pack (7):
* 60 packs x 7 cards per pack = 420 cards
* Each page can hold 10 cards
* To calculate the number of pages Punger needs to buy, we divide the total number of cards (420) by the number of cards per page (10):
* 420 cards / 10 cards per page = 42 pages

Answer: 42
