Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Tim spent a total of $50.00 on Chinese take-out
* 80% of the $50.00 went to 4 entrees
* The remaining 20% went to 2 appetizers

First, let's calculate the amount spent on the 4 entrees:
* 80% of $50.00 = 0.80 x $50.00 = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the amount spent on the 2 appetizers:
* The remaining 20% = $50.00 - $40.00 = $10.00

Since the 2 appetizers cost the same amount, we can divide the $10.00 spent on the appetizers by 2 to get the price of a single appetizer:
* $10.00 / 2 = $5.00

Answer: $5.00
