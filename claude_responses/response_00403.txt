Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kimiko is 28 years old.
2. Omi is twice as old as Kimiko, so Omi's age is 2 x 28 = 56 years old.
3. Arlette is 3/4 times as old as Kimiko, so Arlette's age is 3/4 x 28 = 21 years old.

Now, to calculate the average age of the three:
* Average age = (Kimiko's age + Omi's age + Arlette's age) / 3
* Average age = (28 + 56 + 21) / 3
* Average age = 105 / 3
* Average age = 35

Answer: 35
