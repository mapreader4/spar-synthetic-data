Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, the frog laid 50 eggs.
2. On the second day, the frog doubled her production, so she laid 50 x 2 = 100 eggs.
3. On the third day, the frog laid 20 more than the second day, so she laid 100 + 20 = 120 eggs.
4. On the fourth day, the frog doubled the total of the first three days. The total of the first three days is 50 + 100 + 120 = 270. So on the fourth day, she laid 270 x 2 = 540 eggs.

Now, to find the total number of eggs laid over the 4 days, we add up the eggs laid on each day:
50 + 100 + 120 + 540 = 810

Answer: 810
