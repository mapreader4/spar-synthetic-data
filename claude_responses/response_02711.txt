Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ross takes 17 breaths per minute
* Each breath, he inhales 5/9 liter of air
* We want to find the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours

First, let's calculate the volume of air inhaled per minute:
* 17 breaths per minute x 5/9 liter per breath = 85/9 liters per minute

Now, let's calculate the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours:
* 85/9 liters per minute x 60 minutes per hour x 24 hours = 17,200 liters

Therefore, the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours is:
Answer: 17,200 liters
