Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Matt orders 15 pounds of beef.
2) 1 pound = 16 ounces.
3) Therefore, 15 pounds of beef = 15 * 16 = 240 ounces of beef.
4) Matt cuts the beef into 12-ounce steaks.
5) To find the number of steaks, we divide the total ounces of beef by the ounces per steak:
240 ounces / 12 ounces per steak = 20 steaks.

Answer: 20
