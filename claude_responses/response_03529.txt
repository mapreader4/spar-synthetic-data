Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of people who attended the game: 50
* 40% of the audience are supporters of the first team
* 34% of the audience are supporters of the second team

First, let's calculate the number of supporters for the first team:
* 40% of 50 people = 0.40 * 50 = 20 people

Next, let's calculate the number of supporters for the second team:
* 34% of 50 people = 0.34 * 50 = 17 people

Now, to find the number of people who did not support either team, we need to subtract the number of supporters for each team from the total number of people:
* 50 people - 20 supporters of first team - 17 supporters of second team = 13 people
