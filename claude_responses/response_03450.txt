Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Mowing the lawn:
   - Carson has to mow 40 lines
   - It takes him 2 minutes to mow one line
   - Therefore, to mow all 40 lines, it will take him:
     40 lines x 2 minutes/line = 80 minutes

2. Planting the flowers:
   - Carson needs to plant 8 rows of flowers
   - Each row has 7 flowers
   - It takes him 0.5 minutes (half a minute) to plant each flower
   - Therefore, to plant all 56 flowers (8 rows x 7 flowers/row), it will take him:
     56 flowers x 0.5 minutes/flower = 28 minutes

3. Total time spent gardening:
   - Mowing the lawn: 80 minutes
   - Planting the flowers: 28 minutes
   - Total time: 80 minutes + 28 minutes = 108 minutes

Answer: 108
