Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 63 Easter eggs in the yard
* Hannah found twice as many Easter eggs as Helen
* Let's represent the number of Easter eggs Helen found as x
* Since Hannah found twice as many as Helen, Hannah found 2x Easter eggs

We know that the total number of Easter eggs found is 63, so we can set up an equation:
* x + 2x = 63
* 3x = 63
* x = 21

Therefore, Helen found 21 Easter eggs, and Hannah found 2 times that amount, which is:
* 2 * 21 = 42 Easter eggs

Answer: 42
