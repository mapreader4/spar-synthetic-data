Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Mark bought a new puppy that cost $10
* He also bought enough food for 3 weeks
* The puppy eats 1/3 cup of food per day
* A bag of food with 3.5 cups costs $2

First, let's calculate how much food the puppy will need for 3 weeks:
* 1/3 cup per day x 7 days per week x 3 weeks = 7 cups of food needed

Now, let's calculate how many bags of food Mark needs to buy:
* 7 cups of food needed / 3.5 cups per bag = 2 bags of food needed

Finally, let's calculate the total cost:
* Puppy cost: $10
* Food cost: 2 bags x $2 per bag = $4
* Total cost: $10 + $4 = $14

Answer: $14
