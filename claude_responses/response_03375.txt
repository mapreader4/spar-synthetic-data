Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 150 students total.
2) 60% of the students are girls, which means 40% are boys.
3) To find the number of boys, we take 40% of 150 students:
   * 40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60 boys
4) Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs, which means 2/3 of the boys did not join.
5) To find the number of boys who did not join varsity clubs, we take 2/3 of the 60 boys:
   * 2/3 * 60 = 40 boys did not join varsity clubs.

Answer: 40
