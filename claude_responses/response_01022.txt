Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We are given that Rachel is 4 years older than Leah.
2) We are also given that the sum of their ages is 34.
3) Let's represent Leah's age as x.
4) Since Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, Rachel's age can be represented as x + 4.
5) The sum of their ages is 34, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 4) = 34
6) Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 4 = 34
7) Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
2x = 30
8) Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 15
9) Since Leah's age is 15, and Rachel is 4 years older, Rachel's age is 15 + 4 = 19.

Answer: 19
