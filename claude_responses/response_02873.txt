Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The children's home has 40 children in total
* The home has five times as many teenagers as toddlers
* There are 6 toddlers
* We need to find the number of newborns

First, let's find the number of teenagers:
* Since there are 5 times as many teenagers as toddlers, and there are 6 toddlers, there must be 6 x 5 = 30 teenagers

Now, we can find the total number of children that are not newborns:
* 6 toddlers + 30 teenagers = 36 children

Finally, we can find the number of newborns:
* Total children = 40
* Non-newborns = 36
* Newborns = 40 - 36 = 4
