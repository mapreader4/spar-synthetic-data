Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mike wants to buy a red car for $35,000
* He needs to take out a loan from the bank for $20,000
* The interest rate on the loan is 15%

To calculate the total amount Mike will need to pay for the car, we need to find the interest he will have to pay on the $20,000 loan.

The interest on the loan will be:
* 15% of $20,000 = 0.15 x $20,000 = $3,000

So, the total amount Mike will need to pay for the car is:
* $35,000 (the cost of the car) + $3,000 (the interest on the loan) = $38,000

Answer: 38000
