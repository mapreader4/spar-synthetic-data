Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John and Steve bought 12 cupcakes together.
2) Each cupcake cost $1.50.
3) To find the total cost of the cupcakes, we multiply the number of cupcakes (12) by the cost per cupcake ($1.50):
   12 cupcakes x $1.50 per cupcake = $18 total cost
4) Since John and Steve are splitting the costs evenly, we divide the total cost ($18) by 2 to find how much each person paid:
   $18 total cost / 2 people = $9 per person
Answer: $9
