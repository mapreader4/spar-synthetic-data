Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The mother duck has 8 ducklings
* The first 3 ducklings find 5 snails each
* So the first 3 ducklings find a total of 3 * 5 = 15 snails
* The next 3 ducklings find 9 snails each
* So the next 3 ducklings find a total of 3 * 9 = 27 snails
* The remaining 2 ducklings each find half the number of snails that the mother duck finds
* The mother duck finds 3 times the total number of snails as the first 2 groups of ducklings
* The first 2 groups of ducklings found 15 + 27 = 42 snails
* So the mother duck finds 3 * 42 = 126 snails
* The remaining 2 ducklings each find 126 / 2 = 63 snails each
* So the remaining 2 ducklings find a total of 2 * 63 = 126 snails

Now we can add up the total number of snails found by the family of ducks:
* 15 + 27 + 126 + 126 = 294 snails

Answer: 294
