Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wilma has a garden with 3 types of flowers: yellow, green, and red.
2) The garden has 6 rows, with 13 flowers in each row.
3) Wilma has 12 yellow flowers.
4) Wilma has two times more green flowers than yellow flowers. So, the number of green flowers is 2 x 12 = 24.
5) The total number of flowers in the garden is 6 rows x 13 flowers per row = 78 flowers.
6) The number of red flowers is the total number of flowers minus the yellow and green flowers:
   Total flowers = 78
   Yellow flowers = 12
   Green flowers = 24
   Red flowers = 78 - 12 - 24 = 42

Answer: 42
