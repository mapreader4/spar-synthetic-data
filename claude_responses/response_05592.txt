Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Melissa bought 4 packs of tennis balls
* Each pack costs $24 in total
* Each pack contains 3 balls per pack
* To find the cost per tennis ball, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of tennis balls

First, let's find the total number of tennis balls:
* 4 packs x 3 balls per pack = 12 tennis balls

Now, let's find the cost per tennis ball:
* Total cost: $24
* Total number of tennis balls: 12
* Cost per tennis ball: $24 / 12 = $2
