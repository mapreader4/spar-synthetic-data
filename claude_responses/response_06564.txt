Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Aimee polled 50% men and 50% women
* 35% of women were in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes
* 39 women opposed this idea

First, let's find the number of women who were in favor of the idea:
* 35% of women were in favor
* So, if 39 women opposed the idea, then the number of women in favor would be 39 / (1 - 0.35) = 60

Now, we know that Aimee polled an equal number of men and women, so the total number of people polled would be:
* Total people polled = 2 * (60 + 39) = 198

Answer: 198
