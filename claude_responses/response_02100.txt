Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Victoria was given a $50 bill by her mother.
2) She bought:
   - 2 boxes of pizza at $12 each, so 2 x $12 = $24
   - 2 packs of juice drinks at $2 each, so 2 x $2 = $4
3) The total amount she spent is $24 + $4 = $28.
4) To calculate the amount she should return to her mother, we take the original $50 and subtract the $28 she spent:
   $50 - $28 = $22.

Answer: 22
