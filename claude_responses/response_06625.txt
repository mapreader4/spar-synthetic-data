Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ivan bought 48 apples to make 24 full-size pies
* Each full-size pie requires a certain number of apples, let's call this number x
* Since Ivan made 24 full-size pies, the total number of apples used for the full-size pies is 24x
* However, Ivan decided to make mini pies instead, which only use 1/2 an apple each
* He made 24 mini pies, so the total number of apples used for the mini pies is 12 (24 * 1/2)
* The total number of apples used is 24x + 12
* The number of apples leftover is 48 - (24x + 12)

To find the number of apples leftover, we need to solve for x. We know that each full-size pie requires x apples, and Ivan made 24 full-size pies, so the total number of apples used for the full-size pies is 24x.

Since Ivan made 24 mini pies, which use 1/2 an apple each, the total number of apples used for the mini pies is 12.

Therefore, the total number of apples used is 24x + 12.

The number of apples leftover is 48 - (24x + 12) = 48 - 24x - 12 = 12 - 24x.

Answer: 12 - 24x apples leftover.
