Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carl gives each student 10 index cards
* He teaches 6 periods a day
* Each class has 30 students
* A 50 pack of index cards costs $3

First, let's calculate the total number of index cards needed per day:
* 10 index cards per student x 30 students per class = 300 index cards per class
* 300 index cards per class x 6 classes per day = 1,800 index cards per day

Now, let's calculate the number of 50-packs of index cards needed:
* 1,800 index cards per day / 50 index cards per pack = 36 packs per day

Finally, let's calculate the total cost:
* 36 packs per day x $3 per pack = $108 per day

Answer: $108
