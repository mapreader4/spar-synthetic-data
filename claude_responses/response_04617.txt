Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maggie earns $5.00 for each magazine subscription she sells
* She sold 4 subscriptions to her parents
* She sold 1 subscription to her grandfather
* She sold 2 subscriptions to the next-door neighbor
* She sold twice as many subscriptions to another neighbor, which is 2 x 2 = 4 subscriptions

Now, let's calculate the total number of subscriptions she sold:
* 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11 subscriptions

Finally, to calculate the total amount of money she earned, we multiply the total number of subscriptions by the amount earned per subscription:
* 11 subscriptions x $5.00 per subscription = $55.00
