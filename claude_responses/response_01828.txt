Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Joseph initially invested $1000 into the hedge fund.
2) The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%.
3) Joseph deposited an additional $100 every month into the account.
4) We need to calculate the total amount of money he will have in the fund after two years.

To do this, we can break it down into the following steps:
1) Calculate the interest earned on the initial $1000 investment over the two-year period:
   - Interest earned in year 1: $1000 x 0.10 = $100
   - Interest earned in year 2: $1100 x 0.10 = $110
   - Total interest earned: $100 + $110 = $210

2) Calculate the total amount of additional deposits made over the two-year period:
   - $100 per month for 24 months = $2400

3) Add the initial investment, the interest earned, and the additional deposits:
   - $1000 + $210 + $2400 = $3610

Therefore, the total amount of money Joseph will have in the fund after two years is:
Answer: $3610
