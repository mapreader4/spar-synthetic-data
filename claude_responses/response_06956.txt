Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Viggo spent $80 on a shirt.
2) He paid with $20 and $10 bills.
3) He gave the clerk one more $20 bill than $10 bills.
4) Let's say he gave x $10 bills.
5) Then he gave x + 1 $20 bills.
6) The total amount he gave is x * $10 + (x + 1) * $20 = $80.
7) Solving this equation:
x * $10 + (x + 1) * $20 = $80
10x + 20x + 20 = 80
30x = 60
x = 2
