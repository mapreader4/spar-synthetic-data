Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The person with a degree earns three times the amount paid to a diploma holder for the same position.
* The pay for a person holding a diploma certificate is $4000 per month.
* To calculate Jared's annual earnings after graduating with a degree, we need to first calculate the monthly earnings for a degree holder.
* Since the degree holder earns three times the amount paid to a diploma holder, we can calculate the monthly earnings for a degree holder as:
    * $4000 per month (diploma holder) x 3 = $12,000 per month (degree holder)
* Now, to calculate Jared's annual earnings, we need to multiply the monthly earnings by 12 months:
    * $12,000 per month x 12 months = $144,000 per year

Answer: $144,000
