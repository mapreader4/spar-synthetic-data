Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Daisy's milk cow provides 16 cups of milk per day.
2) 75% of the 16 cups is consumed by Daisy's kids. 75% of 16 is 0.75 * 16 = 12 cups consumed by the kids.
3) That leaves 16 - 12 = 4 cups of milk remaining.
4) Daisy uses 50% of the remaining 4 cups to cook with. 50% of 4 is 0.5 * 4 = 2 cups used for cooking.
5) The amount of milk left over is the remaining 4 - 2 = 2 cups.

Answer: 2 cups
