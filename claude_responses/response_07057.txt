Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of flowers: 96
* There are 4 colors of flowers: green, red, blue, and yellow
* There are 9 green flowers
* There are three times more red flowers than green flowers, so there are 3 x 9 = 27 red flowers
* Blue flowers make up 50% of the total flower count, which means there are 96 x 0.5 = 48 blue flowers
* To find the number of yellow flowers, we need to subtract the number of green, red, and blue flowers from the total number of flowers:
* Total flowers - (green + red + blue) = yellow flowers
* 96 - (9 + 27 + 48) = 12 yellow flowers

Answer: 12
