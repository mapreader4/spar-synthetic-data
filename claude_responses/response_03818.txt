Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were a total of 672 balloons
* The balloons were divided into equal groups, so we don't know the exact number of balloons in each color group
* Anya took home half of the yellow balloons
* To find the number of yellow balloons Anya took home, we need to first find the total number of yellow balloons

Since we don't know the exact number of balloons in each color group, let's assume that the 672 balloons were divided equally among the 4 colors (green, blue, yellow, and red).
* 672 balloons / 4 colors = 168 balloons per color

Now, Anya took home half of the yellow balloons, which is:
* 168 yellow balloons / 2 = 84 yellow balloons

Therefore, the number of balloons Anya took home is:
Answer: 84
