Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Andy started the year weighing 156 pounds
* He then grew 3 inches and gained 36 pounds
* So his new weight after the growth and weight gain is 156 + 36 = 192 pounds
* Over the next 3 months, he lost an eighth of his weight every month
* An eighth of 192 is 192 / 8 = 24 pounds
* So in the first month, he lost 24 pounds, leaving him at 192 - 24 = 168 pounds
* In the second month, he lost another 24 pounds, leaving him at 168 - 24 = 144 pounds
* In the third month, he lost another 24 pounds, leaving him at 144 - 24 = 120 pounds

Now, to calculate how much less he weighs now than at the beginning of the year:
* Andy started at 156 pounds
* He now weighs 120 pounds
* The difference is 156 - 120 = 36 pounds

Answer: 36 pounds
