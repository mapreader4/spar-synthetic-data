Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The bathroom floor is 24 square feet.
2) The kitchen floor is 80 square feet.
3) Jack can mop 8 square feet per minute.
4) To find the total area that Jack needs to mop, we add the bathroom and kitchen floor areas:
   24 square feet + 80 square feet = 104 square feet.
5) To find the time it takes Jack to mop the total area, we divide the total area by the mopping rate:
   104 square feet / 8 square feet per minute = 13 minutes.
