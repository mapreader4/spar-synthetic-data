Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Vicente bought 5 kilograms of rice.
2) Each kilogram of rice costs $2.
3) So the total cost of the rice is 5 kilograms x $2 per kilogram = $10.
4) Vicente also bought 3 pounds of meat.
5) Each pound of meat costs $5.
6) So the total cost of the meat is 3 pounds x $5 per pound = $15.
7) To find the total amount Vicente spent, we add the cost of the rice and the cost of the meat:
$10 + $15 = $25.

Answer: 25
