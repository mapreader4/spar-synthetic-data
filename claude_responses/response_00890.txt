Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Javier threw the javelin three times in the last Olympics
* The first throw was twice as far as the second throw
* The third throw was twice as far as the first throw
* The sum of all three throws was 1050 meters

Let's represent the distances of the three throws as:
* First throw: x meters
* Second throw: x/2 meters
* Third throw: 2x meters

We know that the sum of all three throws is 1050 meters, so we can set up an equation:
x + x/2 + 2x = 1050

Solving for x:
3.5x = 1050
x = 300 meters

Therefore, Javier threw the javelin 300 meters on his first throw.

Answer: 300 meters
