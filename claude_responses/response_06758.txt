Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eric spent 2 hours removing wallpaper from 1 wall of his 4-walled dining room
* This means he spent 2 hours on 1/4 of the total wallpaper in the dining room
* To find the total time it would take him to remove the wallpaper from the entire dining room, we can multiply the 2 hours by 4 (since there are 4 walls)
* 2 hours x 4 = 8 hours to remove all the wallpaper from the dining room
* Eric also needs to remove wallpaper from his 4-walled living room
* Since the living room also has 4 walls, it will also take him 8 hours to remove all the wallpaper from the living room
* Therefore, the total time it will take him to remove the remaining wallpaper is:
* 8 hours (dining room) + 8 hours (living room) = 16 hours

Answer: 16 hours
