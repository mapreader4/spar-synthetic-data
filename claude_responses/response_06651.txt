Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that there are 285 sweets in the bowl.
2) 49 of the sweets are red.
3) 59 of the sweets are green.
4) To find the number of sweets that are neither red nor green, we need to subtract the number of red and green sweets from the total number of sweets.
5) The number of red and green sweets is 49 + 59 = 108.
6) Therefore, the number of sweets that are neither red nor green is 285 - 108 = 177.

Answer: 177
