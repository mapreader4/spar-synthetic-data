Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. To display the full year, they need to light enough fireworks to show the numbers 2, 0, 2, and 3. 
   * Each number requires 6 fireworks, so that's 6 x 4 = 24 fireworks.

2. To write "HAPPY NEW YEAR" in the sky, they need to light enough fireworks for each letter.
   * There are 11 letters in "HAPPY NEW YEAR".
   * Each letter requires 5 fireworks, so that's 5 x 11 = 55 fireworks.

3. They then light another 50 boxes of fireworks as part of the display.
   * Each box contains 8 fireworks, so that's 50 x 8 = 400 fireworks.

4. To calculate the total number of fireworks lit during the display, we add up the fireworks from each part:
   * 24 + 55 + 400 = 479 fireworks

Answer: 479
