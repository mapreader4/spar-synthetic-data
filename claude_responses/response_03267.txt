Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Caleb's grandfather is turning 79 years old.
2) Caleb puts one candle for each year, so the total number of candles on the cake is 79.
3) Caleb puts 27 yellow candles and 14 red candles.
4) To find the number of blue candles, we need to subtract the number of yellow and red candles from the total number of candles.
5) 79 total candles - 27 yellow candles - 14 red candles = 38 blue candles.

Answer: 38
