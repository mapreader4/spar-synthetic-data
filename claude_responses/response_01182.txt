Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Anderson bought 2 bags of 3-pound cat food
* Each bag of cat food weighs 3 pounds
* So the total weight of the cat food is 2 bags x 3 pounds per bag = 6 pounds of cat food
* Mrs. Anderson also bought 2 bags of dog food
* Each bag of dog food weighs 2 more pounds than each bag of cat food
* So each bag of dog food weighs 3 pounds + 2 pounds = 5 pounds
* The total weight of the dog food is 2 bags x 5 pounds per bag = 10 pounds of dog food
* The total weight of all the pet food is 6 pounds of cat food + 10 pounds of dog food = 16 pounds
* There are 16 ounces in each pound
* So the total ounces of pet food is 16 pounds x 16 ounces per pound = 256 ounces

Answer: 256 ounces
