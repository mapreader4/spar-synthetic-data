Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The vet fees for dogs are $15 each, and the vet fees for cats are $13 each.
2) 8 families adopted dogs, and 3 families adopted cats.
3) To calculate the total vet fees collected:
   - 8 dogs x $15 = $120 in vet fees for dogs
   - 3 cats x $13 = $39 in vet fees for cats
   - Total vet fees collected = $120 + $39 = $159
4) The vet donated a third of the fees they were paid back to the shelter.
5) To calculate the amount donated:
   - One third of $159 = $159 / 3 = $53

Answer: $53
