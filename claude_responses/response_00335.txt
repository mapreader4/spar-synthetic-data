Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eve wants to buy cooking gear for her 3 nieces
* The items she wants to buy are:
  - Hand mitts: $14.00 each
  - Apron: $16.00 each
  - Set of 3 cooking utensils: $10.00 per set
  - Small knife: twice the amount of the utensils, so $20.00 each
* The store is offering a 25% off sale on all cooking gear
* To calculate the total cost:
  - 3 hand mitts: 3 x $14.00 = $42.00
  - 3 aprons: 3 x $16.00 = $48.00
  - 3 sets of 3 cooking utensils: 3 x $10.00 = $30.00
  - 3 small knives: 3 x $20.00 = $60.00
  - Total cost before discount: $42.00 + $48.00 + $30.00 + $60.00 = $180.00
* Applying the 25% discount:
  - Discount amount: $180.00 x 0.25 = $45.00
  - Total cost after discount: $180.00 - $45.00 = $135.00

Answer: $135
