Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Store 1:
* The original price of the computer is $950.
* The discount is 6%, which means the final price will be 94% of the original price.
* The final price at Store 1 is $950 * 0.94 = $893.

Store 2:
* The original price of the computer is €920.
* The discount is 5%, which means the final price will be 95% of the original price.
* The final price at Store 2 is €920 * 0.95 = €874.

Now, to find the difference in price between the two stores, we need to convert the Euro price to US Dollars.
* Assuming the exchange rate is 1 Euro = $1.10, the price at Store 2 is €874 * $1.10 = $961.40.

The difference in price between the two stores is:
$961.40 - $893 = $68.40

Answer: $68
