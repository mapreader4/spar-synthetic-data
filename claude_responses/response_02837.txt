Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Leila ordered 3 chocolate cakes at $12 each.
2) The total cost of the chocolate cakes is 3 x $12 = $36.
3) Leila also ordered 6 strawberry cakes at $22 each.
4) The total cost of the strawberry cakes is 6 x $22 = $132.
5) To calculate the total amount Leila should pay Ali, we add the cost of the chocolate cakes and the strawberry cakes:
$36 + $132 = $168.
