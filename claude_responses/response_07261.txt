Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) On November 1, 2005, the fuel tank was full and contained 3,000 L.
2) On January 1, 2006, the tank counter indicated that 180 L remained.
3) This means that the amount of fuel used between November 1, 2005 and January 1, 2006 was:
3,000 L - 180 L = 2,820 L
4) On January 1, 2006, Mr. Fortchaud filled the tank completely again.
5) On May 1, 2006, the meter read 1,238 L.
6) This means that the amount of fuel used between January 1, 2006 and May 1, 2006 was:
3,000 L - 1,238 L = 1,762 L
7) The total amount of fuel used between November 1, 2005 and May 1, 2006 is the sum of the two amounts:
2,820 L + 1,762 L = 4,582 L

Answer: 4,582 L
