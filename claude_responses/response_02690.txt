Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bonnie bought 8 apples.
2) Samuel bought 20 more apples than Bonnie, so he bought 8 + 20 = 28 apples.
3) Samuel then ate half of the 28 apples, which is 28 / 2 = 14 apples.
4) Samuel then used 1/7 of the remaining 14 apples to make apple pie, which is 14 / 7 = 2 apples.
5) So the number of apples Samuel has left is the remaining 14 - 2 = 12 apples.

Answer: 12
