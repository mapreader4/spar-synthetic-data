Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Michael has a total of 36 pets
* 25% of the pets are dogs
* 50% of the pets are cats
* The remaining pets are bunnies

First, let's calculate how many dogs Michael has:
* 25% of 36 pets = 0.25 * 36 = 9 dogs

Next, let's calculate how many cats Michael has:
* 50% of 36 pets = 0.50 * 36 = 18 cats

Now, we can calculate the number of bunnies by subtracting the number of dogs and cats from the total number of pets:
* Total pets = 36
* Dogs = 9
* Cats = 18
* Bunnies = 36 - 9 - 18 = 9 bunnies

Answer: 9
