Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 40 red candies.
2) The number of yellow candies was 3 times the number of red candies, minus 20. So, the number of yellow candies was 3 * 40 - 20 = 100.
3) The number of blue candies was half the number of yellow candies. So, the number of blue candies was 100 / 2 = 50.
4) Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, so the number of yellow candies remaining is 0.
5) The number of candies remaining is the sum of the red candies and the blue candies: 40 + 50 = 90.

Answer: 90
