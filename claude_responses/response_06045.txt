Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Sam has $75.
2) Billy has $25 less than twice the money Sam has.
3) To find how much money Billy has, we first need to calculate twice the money Sam has:
   * Twice the money Sam has = 2 x $75 = $150
4) Now, we subtract $25 from $150 to get the amount of money Billy has:
   * Billy's money = $150 - $25 = $125
5) Now, to find the total amount of money they have together, we add Sam's money and Billy's money:
   * Total money = Sam's money + Billy's money
   * Total money = $75 + $125 = $200

Answer: $200
