Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anika's current age is 30
* Maddie's current age is 4/3 of Anika's age, which means Maddie's current age is 4/3 * 30 = 40
* In 15 years, Anika's age will be 30 + 15 = 45
* In 15 years, Maddie's age will be 40 + 15 = 55
* The average age of Anika and Maddie in 15 years will be (45 + 55) / 2 = 50

Answer: 50
