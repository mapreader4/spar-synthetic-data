Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The truck has a capacity of 6000 stone blocks.
2) Stella and Twinkle are filling the truck at a rate of 250 blocks per hour per person.
3) They work for 4 hours.
4) After 4 hours, they are joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate of 250 blocks per hour per person.
5) To calculate the total number of blocks filled in the first 4 hours:
   - Stella and Twinkle each fill 250 blocks per hour
   - So in 4 hours, they fill 2 * 250 * 4 = 2000 blocks
6) After 4 hours, there are 8 people (Stella, Twinkle, and 6 others) working at the same rate.
7) To calculate the remaining number of blocks needed to fill the truck:
   - Total capacity of the truck is 6000 blocks
   - 2000 blocks were filled in the first 4 hours
   - Remaining blocks needed = 6000 - 2000 = 4000 blocks
8) To calculate the time needed to fill the remaining 4000 blocks with 8 people working at 250 blocks per hour per person:
   - 8 people * 250 blocks per hour per person = 2000 blocks per hour
   - 4000 remaining blocks / 2000 blocks per hour = 2 hours
9) Therefore, the total time taken to fill the truck is 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

Answer: 6 hours
