Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Briar has to take a cab ride to the event and back home every day for a one-week event
* The event is 200 miles away from Briar's home
* The cab ride costs $2.5 per mile

To calculate the total cost of the cab rides, we need to:
1. Calculate the total distance Briar has to travel each day
2. Multiply the total distance by the cost per mile to get the cost per day
3. Multiply the cost per day by the number of days (7) to get the total cost

1. Total distance per day:
   * Distance to the event: 200 miles
   * Distance back home: 200 miles
   * Total distance per day: 200 + 200 = 400 miles

2. Cost per day:
   * Cost per mile: $2.5
   * Total cost per day: 400 miles x $2.5 per mile = $1,000

3. Total cost for the week:
   * Number of days: 7
   * Total cost: $1,000 per day x 7 days = $7,000

Answer: $7,000
