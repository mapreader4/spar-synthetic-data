Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Andy can get 50 demerits in a month before getting fired
* He got 2 demerits per instance for showing up late 6 times
* So for the 6 instances of showing up late, he got 6 * 2 = 12 demerits
* He also got 15 demerits for making an inappropriate joke
* So the total demerits he has received so far this month is 12 + 15 = 27 demerits
* To calculate how many more demerits he can get before getting fired, we take the maximum demerits (50) and subtract the demerits he has already received (27)
* 50 - 27 = 23

Answer: 23
