Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Kylie made 10 beaded necklaces
* Each beaded necklace requires 20 beads
* So for the 10 beaded necklaces made on Monday, Kylie used 10 * 20 = 200 beads
* On Tuesday, Kylie made 2 beaded necklaces
* Each beaded necklace requires 20 beads
* So for the 2 beaded necklaces made on Tuesday, Kylie used 2 * 20 = 40 beads
* On Wednesday, Kylie made 5 beaded bracelets
* Each beaded bracelet requires 10 beads
* So for the 5 beaded bracelets made on Wednesday, Kylie used 5 * 10 = 50 beads
* On Wednesday, Kylie also made 7 beaded earrings
* Each beaded earring requires 5 beads
* So for the 7 beaded earrings made on Wednesday, Kylie used 7 * 5 = 35 beads
* To calculate the total number of beads used:
* 200 + 40 + 50 + 35 = 325 beads

Answer: 325
