Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We are told that there are twice as many cows as dogs at the petting farm.
2) We are given that there are currently 184 cows at the farm.
3) Since there are twice as many cows as dogs, we can divide the number of cows by 2 to get the number of dogs:
   * Number of dogs = 184 / 2 = 92
4) The farm owner decides to sell 1/4 of the cows and 3/4 of the dogs.
5) To find the number of cows remaining, we take 1/4 of 184:
   * Cows remaining = 184 - (184 * 1/4) = 184 - 46 = 138
6) To find the number of dogs remaining, we take 3/4 of 92:
   * Dogs remaining = 92 - (92 * 3/4) = 92 - 69 = 23
7) To find the total number of animals remaining, we add the cows and dogs:
   * Total animals remaining = 138 + 23 = 161

Answer: 161
