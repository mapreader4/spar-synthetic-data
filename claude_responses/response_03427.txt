Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hans is currently 8 years old
* In four years, Annika will be three times as old as Hans
* So, in four years, Annika's age will be 3 * (Hans' age in four years)
* Hans' age in four years will be 8 + 4 = 12
* Therefore, Annika's age in four years will be 3 * 12 = 36
* To find Annika's current age, we subtract 4 years from 36 years
* Annika's current age = 36 - 4 = 32

Answer: 32
