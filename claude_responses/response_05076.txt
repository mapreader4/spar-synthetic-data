Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The TV's initial price was $500.
2. The TV's price increased by 2/5 times its initial price. 
   * 2/5 of $500 = $200
   * The new price of the TV is $500 + $200 = $700

3. The phone's initial price was $400.
4. The phone's price increased by 40% from its original price.
   * 40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160
   * The new price of the phone is $400 + $160 = $560

5. The total amount Bethany received for the items is the sum of the new prices of the TV and the phone.
   * Total amount = $700 + $560 = $1,260

Answer: $1,260
