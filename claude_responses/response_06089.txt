Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Javier's Portion:
   - 5 meat ravioli at 1.5 ounces each: 5 x 1.5 = 7.5 ounces
   - 2 pumpkin ravioli at 1.25 ounces each: 2 x 1.25 = 2.5 ounces
   - 4 cheese ravioli at 1 ounce each: 4 x 1 = 4 ounces
   Total for Javier: 7.5 + 2.5 + 4 = 14 ounces

2. Javier's brother's Portion:
   - 12 pumpkin ravioli at 1.25 ounces each: 12 x 1.25 = 15 ounces

3. Determining the winner:
   The winner is the person who ate the most ounces of ravioli.
   Javier ate 14 ounces, while his brother ate 15 ounces.
   Therefore, the winner is Javier's brother.
