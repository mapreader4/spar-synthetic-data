Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The reporter earns $0.1 per word
* The reporter earns $60 per article
* The reporter has to finish 3 stories in the next 4 hours
* The reporter averages 10 words per minute

First, let's calculate how many words the reporter can write in 4 hours:
* 10 words per minute x 60 minutes per hour x 4 hours = 2,400 words

Now, let's calculate the reporter's earnings per article:
* $60 per article x 3 articles = $180

Next, let's calculate the reporter's earnings per word:
* $0.1 per word x 2,400 words = $240

Finally, let's add the earnings per article and per word to get the total earnings:
* $180 + $240 = $420

To calculate the earnings per hour, we divide the total earnings by the number of hours:
* $420 / 4 hours = $105 per hour

Answer: $105 per hour
