Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Daniel delivers 20 yards of fabric.
2. On Tuesday, he delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivered on Monday, which is 2 x 20 = 40 yards of fabric.
3. On Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivered on Tuesday, which is 1/4 x 40 = 10 yards of fabric.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from Monday to Wednesday:
* Monday: 20 yards of fabric at $2 per yard = 20 x $2 = $40
* Tuesday: 40 yards of fabric at $2 per yard = 40 x $2 = $80
* Wednesday: 10 yards of fabric at $2 per yard = 10 x $2 = $20

Total revenue from Monday to Wednesday = $40 + $80 + $20 = $140

Answer: 140
