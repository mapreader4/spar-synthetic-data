Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Randy feeds each pig 10 pounds of feed per day
* Randy has 2 pigs
* To calculate the total pounds of feed per day, we multiply the number of pigs (2) by the amount of feed per pig per day (10 pounds):
2 pigs x 10 pounds per pig per day = 20 pounds of feed per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* To calculate the total pounds of feed per week, we multiply the pounds of feed per day (20 pounds) by the number of days in a week (7 days):
20 pounds per day x 7 days per week = 140 pounds of feed per week

Answer: 140
