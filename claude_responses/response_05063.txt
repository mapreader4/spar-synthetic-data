Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chip takes 2 pages of notes every day
* He does this 5 days a week
* He has 5 classes
* So, in one week, Chip uses:
  - 2 pages per day x 5 days per week = 10 pages per week
  - 10 pages per week x 5 classes = 50 pages per week
* After 6 weeks, Chip will use:
  - 50 pages per week x 6 weeks = 300 pages
* Each pack of notebook paper has 100 sheets
* To calculate the number of packs Chip will use:
  - 300 pages / 100 sheets per pack = 3 packs

Answer: 3 packs
