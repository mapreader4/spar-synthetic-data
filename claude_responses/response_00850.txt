Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Viviana has 5 more chocolate chips than Susana.
   * Let's call the number of chocolate chips Susana has as 'x'.
   * Then, the number of chocolate chips Viviana has is 'x + 5'.

2. Susana has 3/4 as many vanilla chips as Viviana.
   * Viviana has 20 vanilla chips.
   * Susana has 3/4 * 20 = 15 vanilla chips.

3. Susana has 25 chocolate chips.
   * So, 'x = 25'.

4. Viviana has 'x + 5' = 25 + 5 = 30 chocolate chips.

5. The total number of chips they have together is:
   * Viviana's vanilla chips: 20
   * Viviana's chocolate chips: 30
   * Susana's vanilla chips: 15
   * Susana's chocolate chips: 25
   * Total chips: 20 + 30 + 15 + 25 = 90

Answer: 90
