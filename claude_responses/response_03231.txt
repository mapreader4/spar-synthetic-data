Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lucca bought 200 pieces of bread.
2) On the first day, he ate 1/4 of the 200 pieces. 1/4 of 200 is 50, so he ate 50 pieces on the first day.
3) After the first day, there were 200 - 50 = 150 pieces remaining.
4) On the second day, he ate 2/5 of the 150 remaining pieces. 2/5 of 150 is 60, so he ate 60 pieces on the second day.
5) After the second day, there were 150 - 60 = 90 pieces remaining.
6) On the third day, he ate 1/2 of the 90 remaining pieces. 1/2 of 90 is 45, so he ate 45 pieces on the third day.
7) After the third day, there were 90 - 45 = 45 pieces remaining.

Answer: 45
