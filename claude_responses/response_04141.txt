Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James originally had 18 chocolate bars to sell
* He sold 5 last week
* He sold 7 this week
* So, the total number of chocolate bars he has sold so far is 5 + 7 = 12
* To find how many more he needs to sell, we take the original 18 and subtract the 12 he has already sold:
* 18 - 12 = 6
