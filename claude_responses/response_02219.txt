Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Job has a total of 150 hectares of land
* 25 hectares are occupied by his house and farm machinery
* 15 hectares have been reserved for future expansion
* 40 hectares are dedicated to rearing cattle
* The remaining land is used for crop production

To calculate the hectares used for crop production, we need to subtract the land used for other purposes from the total land:
* Total land: 150 hectares
* Land used for house and machinery: 25 hectares
* Land reserved for future expansion: 15 hectares
* Land used for cattle rearing: 40 hectares
* Total land used for other purposes: 25 + 15 + 40 = 80 hectares

Now, we can subtract the land used for other purposes from the total land to get the land used for crop production:
* Total land: 150 hectares
* Land used for other purposes: 80 hectares
* Land used for crop production: 150 - 80 = 70 hectares

Answer: 70 hectares
