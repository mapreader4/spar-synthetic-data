Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Edmund uses 18 inches of gift wrapper per gift box
* Edmund has 90 inches of gift wrapper per day
* We want to know how many gift boxes he can wrap every 3 days

First, let's calculate how many gift boxes he can wrap per day:
* 90 inches of gift wrapper per day / 18 inches per gift box = 5 gift boxes per day

Now, to find how many gift boxes he can wrap every 3 days, we multiply the number of gift boxes per day by 3:
* 5 gift boxes per day x 3 days = 15 gift boxes every 3 days

Answer: 15
