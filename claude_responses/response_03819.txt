Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Becky originally had 50 necklaces in her jewelry collection.
* 3 of the necklaces had broken beads, so she collected the unbroken beads and threw out the other parts of those 3 necklaces.
* That means she had 50 - 3 = 47 necklaces left.
* She then bought 5 new necklaces that week.
* So now she has 47 + 5 = 52 necklaces.
* She then decided to give 15 of her old necklaces to her friends as gifts.
* That means she now has 52 - 15 = 37 necklaces.

Answer: 37
