Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Justin is currently 26 years old
* When Justin was born, his elder sister Jessica was 6 years old
* This means that Jessica is currently 26 + 6 = 32 years old
* James is the elder brother, and he is 7 years older than Jessica
* So James is currently 32 + 7 = 39 years old
* The question asks how old James will be after 5 years
* In 5 years, James will be 39 + 5 = 44 years old

Answer: 44
