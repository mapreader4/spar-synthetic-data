Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill sold 8 ounces of fool's gold to a merchant
* He earned $9 for every ounce of fool's gold he sold
* So, for the 8 ounces he sold, he earned:
    * 8 ounces x $9 per ounce = $72
* However, he was then fined $50 by the sheriff
* To calculate the amount of money he is left with, we take the $72 he earned and subtract the $50 fine:
    * $72 - $50 = $22

Answer: $22
