Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Fred has 12 identical candy bars.
2) Uncle Bob has 6 more candy bars than Fred, so Uncle Bob has 12 + 6 = 18 candy bars.
3) The total number of candy bars Fred and Uncle Bob have is 12 + 18 = 30 candy bars.
4) Jacqueline has ten times the total number of candy bars Fred and Uncle Bob have, so Jacqueline has 10 * 30 = 300 candy bars.
5) 40% of Jacqueline's candy bars is 0.4 * 300 = 120 candy bars.

Answer: 120
