Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* We know that there are 24 legs/paws in the pool
* Humans have 2 legs each
* Dogs have 4 legs each
* So the total number of legs/paws can be represented as:
* 2 legs for Daisy + 2 legs for Rose + 4 legs for each dog
* Let's call the number of dogs "x"
* So the equation is: 2 + 2 + 4x = 24
* Simplifying, we get: 4 + 4x = 24
* Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: 4x = 20
* Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 5
* Therefore, Daisy and Rose have 5 dogs.
