Okay, let's break this down step by step:

For the blueberry pie:
* Crust ingredients: $2 for flour, $1 for sugar, $1.5 for eggs and butter = $4.5
* Blueberries: 3 pounds = 48 oz, which is 6 containers at $2.25 each = $13.5
* Total cost for blueberry pie = $4.5 + $13.5 = $18

For the cherry pie:
* Crust ingredients: $2 for flour, $1 for sugar, $1.5 for eggs and butter = $4.5
* Cherries: 4 pounds in a 4-pound bag for $14

Now, we compare the total costs:
* Blueberry pie: $18
* Cherry pie: $4.5 + $14 = $18.5

Therefore, the cheapest pie to make is the blueberry pie.

Answer: $18
