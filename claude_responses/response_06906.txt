Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first try, Homer scored 400 points.
* On the second try, Homer scored 70 points fewer than the first try, which means he scored 400 - 70 = 330 points.
* On the third try, Homer scored twice the number of points he scored on the second try, which means he scored 2 * 330 = 660 points.

Now, to find the total number of points scored in all tries, we add up the points from each try:
* Total points = 400 + 330 + 660
* Total points = 1390

Answer: 1390
