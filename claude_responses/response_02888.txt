Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Chlorine:
   - Original price of 1 liter of chlorine: $10
   - Discount on chlorine: 20% off
   - Discounted price of 1 liter of chlorine: $10 - (20% of $10) = $10 - $2 = $8
   - Cost of 3 liters of chlorine: 3 x $8 = $24

2. Soap:
   - Original price of 1 box of soap: $16
   - Discount on soap: 25% off
   - Discounted price of 1 box of soap: $16 - (25% of $16) = $16 - $4 = $12
   - Cost of 5 boxes of soap: 5 x $12 = $60

3. Total cost without discounts:
   - 3 liters of chlorine: $30
   - 5 boxes of soap: $80
   - Total: $30 + $80 = $110

4. Total cost with discounts:
   - 3 liters of chlorine: $24
   - 5 boxes of soap: $60
   - Total: $24 + $60 = $84

5. Amount saved:
   - Total cost without discounts: $110
   - Total cost with discounts: $84
   - Amount saved: $110 - $84 = $26

Answer: $26
