Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary had 89 stickers to start with.
2) She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal.
3) She used 7 stickers each on 6 other pages of her journal.
4) To calculate the number of stickers used on the 6 other pages, we multiply 7 stickers per page by 6 pages, which is 7 x 6 = 42 stickers.
5) In total, Mary used 3 + 42 = 45 stickers.
6) To calculate the number of stickers Mary has remaining, we subtract the number of stickers used (45) from the number of stickers she had to start with (89).
7) 89 - 45 = 44 stickers remaining.

Answer: 44
