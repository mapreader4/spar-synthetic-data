Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dream's car consumes 4 gallons of gas per mile
* She drives 400 miles today
* She drives 200 more miles tomorrow than today

To calculate the total gas consumption, we need to find the total distance driven and multiply it by the gas consumption per mile.

The total distance driven is:
* 400 miles today + (400 + 200) miles tomorrow = 1,000 miles

Now, we can calculate the total gas consumption:
* 1,000 miles x 4 gallons per mile = 4,000 gallons

Answer: 4,000 gallons
