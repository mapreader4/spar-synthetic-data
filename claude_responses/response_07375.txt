Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carlos needs to wash two loads of laundry
* Each load takes 45 minutes to wash
* So the total time to wash both loads is:
    - 2 loads x 45 minutes per load = 90 minutes
* After washing, he can combine both loads and dry them
* The drying process takes 75 minutes
* So the total time for the drying process is 75 minutes
* To find the total time for the laundry, we add the time for washing and the time for drying:
    - 90 minutes + 75 minutes = 165 minutes

Answer: 165
