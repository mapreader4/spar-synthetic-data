Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vicky has an internet connection that can download up to 50 MB/second
* The program she needs to download is 360 GB in size
* There are 1000 MB per GB

First, we need to convert the program size from GB to MB:
* 360 GB x 1000 MB/GB = 360,000 MB

Next, we need to calculate how long it will take to download the program at the maximum speed of 50 MB/second:
* 360,000 MB / 50 MB/second = 7,200 seconds

Finally, we need to convert the time from seconds to hours:
* 7,200 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 2 hours

Answer: 2 hours
