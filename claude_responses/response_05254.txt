Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Shawn collected 40 plain pebbles.
2) He painted 9 pebbles red and 13 pebbles blue.
3) The remaining pebbles are 40 - 9 - 13 = 18 pebbles.
4) He divided the remaining 18 pebbles equally into 3 groups, so each group has 18 / 3 = 6 pebbles.
5) He painted one group purple, one group yellow, and one group green.
6) So the number of blue pebbles is 13, and the number of yellow pebbles is 6.
7) The difference between the number of blue and yellow pebbles is 13 - 6 = 7.
