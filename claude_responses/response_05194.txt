Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sean orders his patches in units of 100, and is charged $1.25 per patch.
2) So the cost of 100 patches is 100 * $1.25 = $125.
3) He then sells all 100 patches for $12.00 each.
4) The total revenue from selling 100 patches at $12.00 each is 100 * $12.00 = $1,200.
5) To calculate the net profit, we take the total revenue and subtract the total cost:
$1,200 - $125 = $1,075.

Answer: 1075
