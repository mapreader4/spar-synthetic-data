Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Initially, there are 250 books in the library.
2) On Tuesday, 120 books are taken out, so the number of books in the library is reduced to 250 - 120 = 130 books.
3) On Wednesday, 35 books are returned, so the number of books in the library increases to 130 + 35 = 165 books.
4) On Thursday, another 15 books are withdrawn, so the number of books in the library is reduced to 165 - 15 = 150 books.

Answer: 150 books
