Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lori owns 15 times as many beanie babies as Sydney
* Lori has 300 beanie babies
* To find how many beanie babies Sydney has, we divide Lori's 300 beanie babies by 15:
* 300 / 15 = 20 beanie babies
* To find the total number of beanie babies they have, we add Lori's 300 beanie babies and Sydney's 20 beanie babies:
* 300 + 20 = 320 beanie babies

Answer: 320 beanie babies
