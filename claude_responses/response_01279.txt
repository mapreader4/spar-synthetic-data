Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bill earns $25/hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month
* So, his monthly income is:
    - $25/hour x 30 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = $3,000/month
* His annual income is:
    - $3,000/month x 12 months/year = $36,000/year
* The normal monthly price of the plan he wants is $500
* Since Bill's income is between $10,001 and $40,000, the government will pay for 50% of the cost
* So, Bill's monthly cost for the plan is:
    - $500 - (50% of $500) = $500 - $250 = $250
* Bill's annual cost for the plan is:
    - $250/month x 12 months/year = $3,000

Answer: $3,000
