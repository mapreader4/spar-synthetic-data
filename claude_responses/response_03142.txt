Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The initial tank had 4000 liters of oil.
2) Three-quarters of the 4000 liters were poured into the larger tanker. 
3) Three-quarters of 4000 liters is 3000 liters.
4) The larger tanker already had 3000 liters of oil in it.
5) The total amount of oil in the larger tanker is now 3000 + 3000 = 6000 liters.
6) The larger tanker has a capacity of 20000 liters.
7) To make the larger tanker half-full, it needs to have 10000 liters of oil.
8) The difference between the current amount of oil (6000 liters) and the amount needed to make it half-full (10000 liters) is 10000 - 6000 = 4000 liters.

Answer: 4000 liters
