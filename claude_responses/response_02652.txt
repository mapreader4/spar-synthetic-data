Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The school band's goal is to collect $150
* They have earned $10 each from 3 families, which is 3 x $10 = $30
* They have earned $5 each from 15 families, which is 15 x $5 = $75
* So the total amount they have earned so far is $30 + $75 = $105
* To reach their goal of $150, they need to earn $150 - $105 = $45 more

Answer: $45
