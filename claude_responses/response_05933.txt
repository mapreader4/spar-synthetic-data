Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Marly has:
- 10 $20 bills
- 8 $10 bills
- 4 $5 bills
2) To calculate the total amount of money Marly has, we need to multiply the number of bills by their respective values and then add them up:
- 10 $20 bills = 10 x $20 = $200
- 8 $10 bills = 8 x $10 = $80
- 4 $5 bills = 4 x $5 = $20
3) The total amount of money Marly has is $200 + $80 + $20 = $300.
4) To change this to $100 bills, we need to divide $300 by $100:
$300 / $100 = 3
