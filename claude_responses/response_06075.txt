Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim hires two bodyguards
* Each bodyguard charges $20 per hour
* He hires them for 8 hours per day
* He hires them for 7 days per week

To calculate the total amount he pays them in a week, we need to:
1. Calculate the daily cost for each bodyguard:
   * Each bodyguard charges $20 per hour
   * They work 8 hours per day
   * So, each bodyguard costs $20 x 8 = $160 per day
2. Calculate the total daily cost for both bodyguards:
   * There are two bodyguards
   * So, the total daily cost is $160 x 2 = $320
3. Calculate the total weekly cost:
   * The bodyguards work for 7 days per week
   * So, the total weekly cost is $320 x 7 = $2,240

Answer: $2,240
