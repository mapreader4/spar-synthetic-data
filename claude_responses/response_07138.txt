Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Gervais drove an average of 315 miles for 3 days.
   * To find the total miles Gervais drove, we multiply the average miles per day by the number of days:
   * 315 miles per day x 3 days = 945 miles

2. Henri drove a total of 1,250 miles over one week.

3. To find how many miles farther Henri drove, we subtract the total miles Gervais drove from the total miles Henri drove:
   * 1,250 miles - 945 miles = 305 miles

Answer: 305 miles
