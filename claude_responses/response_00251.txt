Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each pie has 3 pieces
* Each pie costs $4 for the 3 pieces
* The bakery can make 12 pies in 1 hour
* The cost to create one pie is $0.5

First, let's calculate the total revenue the bakery would make from selling all the pie pieces:
* 12 pies x 3 pieces per pie = 36 pieces
* 36 pieces x $4 per piece = $144 in total revenue

Next, let's calculate the total cost to the bakery for making the 12 pies:
* 12 pies x $0.5 per pie = $6 in total cost

Finally, to calculate the total profit the bakery would make:
* Total revenue: $144
* Total cost: $6
* Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $144 - $6 = $138

Answer: $138
