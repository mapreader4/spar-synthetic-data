Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The new edition Geometry book has 450 pages
* The new edition has 230 pages less than twice as many pages as the old edition
* Let's represent the number of pages in the old edition as x
* Twice as many pages as the old edition would be 2x
* The new edition has 230 pages less than 2x, so the new edition has 2x - 230 pages
* We know the new edition has 450 pages, so we can set up the equation:
2x - 230 = 450
* Solving for x, we get:
2x = 680
x = 340

Answer: 340
