Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ken had 50 pencils to start with
* He gave 10 pencils to Manny
* He gave 10 more pencils to Nilo than he gave to Manny
   - So, he gave Nilo 10 + 10 = 20 pencils
* Now, let's calculate how many pencils Ken kept:
   - Ken gave away 10 pencils to Manny and 20 pencils to Nilo
   - So, the total number of pencils he gave away is 10 + 20 = 30 pencils
   - He started with 50 pencils, and he gave away 30 pencils
   - Therefore, the number of pencils he kept is 50 - 30 = 20 pencils

Answer: 20
