Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Luke takes a bus to the town center
* He then walks for 15 minutes to the train center
* He waits twice as long for the train to arrive, which means he waits for 30 minutes
* He then takes a 6-hour train ride to London
* The entire trip takes him 8 hours

To find the duration of the bus ride, we need to subtract the other parts of the trip from the total time of 8 hours.

The time spent on the other parts of the trip is:
* Walking to the train center: 15 minutes
* Waiting for the train: 30 minutes
* Train ride to London: 6 hours

Adding these up, we get:
* 15 minutes + 30 minutes + 6 hours = 6 hours and 45 minutes

Now, we subtract this from the total time of 8 hours:
* 8 hours - 6 hours and 45 minutes = 1 hour and 15 minutes

Therefore, the duration of the bus ride is 1 hour and 15 minutes, which is 75 minutes.

Answer: 75
