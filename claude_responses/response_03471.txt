Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Teddy uses 3 less than 5 pounds of fluffy foam material to make each pillow
* So, each pillow requires 5 - 3 = 2 pounds of fluffy foam material
* Teddy has three tons of fluffy foam material
* 1 ton = 2,000 pounds
* Therefore, Teddy has 3 x 2,000 = 6,000 pounds of fluffy foam material
* To find the number of pillows Teddy can make, we divide the total amount of fluffy foam material by the amount required per pillow
* 6,000 pounds / 2 pounds per pillow = 3,000 pillows

Answer: 3,000
