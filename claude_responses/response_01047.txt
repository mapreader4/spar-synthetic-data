Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eddie is 92 years old
* Becky is currently four times younger than Eddie
* To find Becky's age, we divide Eddie's age (92) by 4:
92 / 4 = 23
So Becky is 23 years old.
* Irene, Becky's mother, is two times Becky's age
* To find Irene's age, we multiply Becky's age (23) by 2:
23 x 2 = 46
Answer: 46
