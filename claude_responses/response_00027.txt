Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Brennan initially downloaded 800 files.
2. He then deleted 70% of those 800 files, which means he deleted 0.7 * 800 = 560 files.
3. That leaves him with 800 - 560 = 240 files.
4. He then downloaded 400 more files.
5. He realized that 3/5 of those 400 files were irrelevant, which means he deleted 3/5 * 400 = 240 files.
6. That leaves him with 400 - 240 = 160 valuable files.

Answer: 160
