Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Isabelle's ticket costs $20
* Her brothers' tickets cost $10 each, so 2 x $10 = $20 for both of them
* The total cost of the tickets is $20 + $20 = $40
* Isabelle and her brothers have already saved $5 each, so $5 + $5 = $10
* The remaining amount they need to pay for the tickets is $40 - $10 = $30
* Isabelle's job pays $3 per week
* To calculate how many weeks Isabelle needs to work to afford the tickets, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly pay:
* $30 / $3 per week = 10 weeks

Answer: 10
