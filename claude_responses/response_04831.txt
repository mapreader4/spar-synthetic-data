Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Joyce's previous property was 2 acres
* Her new property is 10 times larger than her previous property
* To calculate the size of her new property:
    - Previous property: 2 acres
    - New property: 2 acres x 10 = 20 acres
* However, her new property has a 1-acre pond where she cannot grow vegetables
* To calculate the amount of land suitable for growing vegetables:
    - Total new property: 20 acres
    - Pond area: 1 acre
    - Land suitable for growing vegetables: 20 acres - 1 acre = 19 acres

Answer: 19 acres
