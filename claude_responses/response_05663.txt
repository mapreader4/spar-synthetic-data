Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The rate for mowing a lawn is $14 per hour.
2) David mowed for 2 hours a day for a week, which is 7 days.
3) So, the total number of hours he mowed is 2 hours per day x 7 days = 14 hours.
4) At a rate of $14 per hour, the total amount of money he made from mowing the lawn is 14 hours x $14 per hour = $196.
5) David then spent half of the money he made from mowing the lawn on a pair of shoes. So, the amount he spent on the shoes is $196 / 2 = $98.
6) The remaining money after buying the shoes is $196 - $98 = $98.
7) David then gave half of the remaining money to his mom. So, the amount he gave to his mom is $98 / 2 = $49.
8) The amount of money David had left is the remaining money after giving half to his mom, which is $98 - $49 = $49.

Answer: $49
