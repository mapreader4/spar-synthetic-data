Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jamestown has 20 theme parks
* Venice has 25 more theme parks than Jamestown
* To find the number of theme parks in Venice, we add 25 to the number of theme parks in Jamestown:
  * Venice = 20 + 25 = 45 theme parks
* Marina Del Ray has 50 more theme parks than Jamestown
* To find the number of theme parks in Marina Del Ray, we add 50 to the number of theme parks in Jamestown:
  * Marina Del Ray = 20 + 50 = 70 theme parks
* To find the total number of theme parks in the three towns, we add the number of theme parks in each town:
  * Total = Jamestown (20) + Venice (45) + Marina Del Ray (70)
  * Total = 20 + 45 + 70 = 135 theme parks

Answer: 135
