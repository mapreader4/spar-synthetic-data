Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Isabel has $204 in her piggy bank.
2) She spent half the amount, which is $204 / 2 = $102, on a toy.
3) She now has $204 - $102 = $102 remaining.
4) She then spent half of the remaining money, which is $102 / 2 = $51, on a book for her brother.
5) She now has $102 - $51 = $51 left over.

Answer: $51
