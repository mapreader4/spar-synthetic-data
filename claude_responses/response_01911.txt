Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brooke starts with 12 balloons and adds 8 more, so he now has 12 + 8 = 20 balloons.
2) Tracy starts with 6 balloons and adds 24 more, so she now has 6 + 24 = 30 balloons.
3) Tracy then pops half of her 30 balloons, which means she has 30 / 2 = 15 balloons remaining.
4) To find the total number of balloons, we add Brooke's 20 balloons and Tracy's 15 balloons:
20 + 15 = 35 balloons.

Answer: 35
