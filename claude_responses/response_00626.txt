Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jessica has 1 hour (60 minutes) to take the exam
* She has answered 16 out of 80 questions so far
* She has used 12 minutes of her time
* We need to find out how much time will be left when she finishes the exam

First, let's calculate her current pace:
* She has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes
* That means she answers 16 / 12 = 1.33 questions per minute

Now, let's calculate how long it will take her to answer the remaining 64 questions:
* 64 questions / 1.33 questions per minute = 48 minutes

Finally, we can calculate the time left when she finishes the exam:
* Total time = 60 minutes
* Time used = 12 minutes
* Time left = 60 minutes - 12 minutes - 48 minutes = 0 minutes

Answer: 0 minutes
