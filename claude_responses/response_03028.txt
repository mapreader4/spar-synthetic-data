Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Mark's beach, there are 20 sandcastles, and each castle has 10 towers.
   * Total number of towers on Mark's beach = 20 castles x 10 towers per castle = 200 towers

2. On Jeff's beach, there are three times as many castles as on Mark's beach.
   * Number of castles on Jeff's beach = 3 x 20 = 60 castles

3. Each castle on Jeff's beach has 5 towers.
   * Total number of towers on Jeff's beach = 60 castles x 5 towers per castle = 300 towers

4. To find the combined total number of sandcastles and towers, we add the number of castles and towers on both beaches:
   * Total number of castles = 20 (Mark's beach) + 60 (Jeff's beach) = 80 castles
   * Total number of towers = 200 (Mark's beach) + 300 (Jeff's beach) = 500 towers
