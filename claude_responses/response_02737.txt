Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On Monday, there were 7 children and 5 adults. 
* The cost of the child tickets is 7 x $3 = $21
* The cost of the adult tickets is 5 x $4 = $20
* The total for Monday is $21 + $20 = $41

On Tuesday, there were 4 children and 2 adults.
* The cost of the child tickets is 4 x $3 = $12
* The cost of the adult tickets is 2 x $4 = $8
* The total for Tuesday is $12 + $8 = $20

To calculate the total money the zoo made for both days, we add the totals for Monday and Tuesday:
* $41 + $20 = $61

Answer: $61
