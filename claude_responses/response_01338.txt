Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Your house has 12 medium ceiling lights
* Small ceiling lights require 1 bulb each
* Medium ceiling lights require 2 bulbs each
* Large ceiling lights require 3 bulbs each
* Your wife says there are twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights
* Your wife also says there are 10 more small ceiling lights than medium ceiling lights

First, let's calculate the number of large ceiling lights:
* If there are twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights, and you have 12 medium ceiling lights, then you have 12 x 2 = 24 large ceiling lights.

Next, let's calculate the number of small ceiling lights:
* Your wife says there are 10 more small ceiling lights than medium ceiling lights
* You have 12 medium ceiling lights, so you have 12 + 10 = 22 small ceiling lights

Now, let's calculate the total number of bulbs needed:
* 12 medium ceiling lights x 2 bulbs each = 24 bulbs
* 24 large ceiling lights x 3 bulbs each = 72 bulbs
* 22 small ceiling lights x 1 bulb each = 22 bulbs
* Total bulbs needed = 24 + 72 + 22 = 118 bulbs

Answer: 118
