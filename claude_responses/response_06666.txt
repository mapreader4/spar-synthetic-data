Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The course lasts for 24 weeks
* Each week, there are:
    - 2 three-hour classes
    - 1 four-hour class
    - 4 hours of small group homework assignments
* To calculate the total hours spent on the course:
    - 2 three-hour classes per week = 2 x 3 = 6 hours per week
    - 1 four-hour class per week = 4 hours per week
    - 4 hours of small group homework assignments per week = 4 hours per week
    - Total hours per week = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 hours per week
    - Total hours for the 24-week course = 14 hours per week x 24 weeks = 336 hours

Answer: 336
