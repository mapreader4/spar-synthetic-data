Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peyton has 3 children
* Each child gets 1 juice box per day
* They get the juice boxes 5 days a week
* The school year is 25 weeks long

First, we need to calculate the number of juice boxes needed per week:
* 3 children x 1 juice box per day x 5 days per week = 15 juice boxes per week

Next, we need to calculate the total number of juice boxes needed for the entire school year:
* 15 juice boxes per week x 25 weeks = 375 juice boxes

Therefore, the total number of juice boxes Peyton will need for the entire school year for all of her children is:

Answer: 375
