Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rick traveled to the first destination on his trip.
2) From the first destination, he traveled twice the distance to the second destination.
3) The third point on his trip was 40 miles away, which was half the distance he traveled from the beginning to his first destination.
4) The final destination took twice the amount of driving of all the other legs put together.

Let's start by finding the distance to the first destination.
* The third point was 40 miles away, which was half the distance to the first destination.
* So the distance to the first destination was 40 * 2 = 80 miles.

Now, the distance to the second destination was twice the distance to the first destination.
* Distance to second destination = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The final destination took twice the amount of driving of all the other legs put together.
* Total distance of the other legs = 80 + 160 + 40 = 280 miles.
* Distance to the final destination = 280 * 2 = 560 miles.

Now we can calculate the total distance traveled:
* Total distance = 80 + 160 + 40 + 560 = 840 miles.

Answer: 840 miles.
