Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 350 trees in the park
* 70% of the trees are pine trees
* To find the number of pine trees, we can calculate 70% of 350:
* 70% of 350 = 0.70 * 350 = 245 pine trees
* To find the number of trees that are not pine trees, we need to subtract the number of pine trees from the total number of trees:
* 350 - 245 = 105 trees that are not pine trees

Answer: 105
