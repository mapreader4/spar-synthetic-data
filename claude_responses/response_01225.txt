Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Donovan Mitchell is currently averaging 26 points per game
* His team has played 15 games this season
* His goal is to average 30 points per game for the entire 20 game season

To find the number of points he needs to average per game to reach his goal, we can use the following formula:

Total points needed for the season = Desired average points per game * Total number of games
* Total points needed for the season = 30 points per game * 20 games = 600 points

Now, we need to find how many more points he needs to score in the remaining 5 games (20 games - 15 games played) to reach his goal of 600 points.

* Points scored so far = 26 points per game * 15 games = 390 points
* Remaining points needed = 600 points - 390 points = 210 points

Finally, to find the average points per game he needs to reach in the remaining 5 games, we divide the remaining points needed by the number of remaining games:

* Average points per game needed = 210 points / 5 games = 42 points per game

Answer: 42 points per game
