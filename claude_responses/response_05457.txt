Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Let's represent the number of koi fish in the pond as x.
* The problem statement says that 14 less than two times the number of koi fish is 64.
* We can represent this mathematically as: 2x - 14 = 64
* To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.
* First, we add 14 to both sides: 2x - 14 + 14 = 64 + 14
* This simplifies to: 2x = 78
* Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to get the value of x:
* x = 78 / 2
* x = 39

Answer: 39
