Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cristian has 50 more black cookies than white cookies in his cookie jar.
2) If he has 80 white cookies, then he has 80 + 50 = 130 black cookies.
3) He eats half of the black cookies, which is 130 / 2 = 65 black cookies.
4) He eats 3/4 of the white cookies, which is 80 * 3/4 = 60 white cookies.
5) So the remaining cookies are:
   - Black cookies: 130 - 65 = 65 black cookies
   - White cookies: 80 - 60 = 20 white cookies
6) The total number of remaining cookies is 65 + 20 = 85 cookies.

Answer: 85
