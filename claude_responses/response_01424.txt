Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Christian and Sue want to buy a $50.00 bottle of perfume for their mom.
2) Christian had $5.00 saved up, and Sue had $7.00 saved up.
3) Christian mowed 4 yards, charging $5.00 per yard, so he earned $20.00.
4) Sue walked 6 dogs, charging $2.00 per dog, so she earned $12.00.
5) Now, let's add up the money they have:
   - Christian: $5.00 + $20.00 = $25.00
   - Sue: $7.00 + $12.00 = $19.00
   - Total: $25.00 + $19.00 = $44.00
6) The bottle of perfume costs $50.00, and they have $44.00, so they need $50.00 - $44.00 = $6.00 more.

Answer: $6
