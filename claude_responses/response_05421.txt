Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Hannah spends a total of $23 on an entree and a dessert.
2) The entree costs $5 more than the dessert.
3) Let's call the cost of the dessert "x".
4) Then the cost of the entree is "x + 5".
5) The total cost is the sum of the entree and the dessert, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 5) = 23
6) Solving for x, we get:
2x + 5 = 23
2x = 18
x = 9
7) Therefore, the cost of the dessert is $9.
8) The cost of the entree is $9 + $5 = $14.
