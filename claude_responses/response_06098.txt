Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Matt goes up the stairs 20 steps per minute
* Tom goes up the stairs 5 steps per minute more than Matt, so Tom goes up 25 steps per minute
* Matt has reached 220 steps above the entrance
* To find how many steps Tom has gone up by the time Matt has reached 220 steps, we need to find how long it took Matt to reach 220 steps, and then multiply that time by Tom's step rate.

First, let's find how long it took Matt to reach 220 steps:
* Matt goes up 20 steps per minute
* So it took Matt 220 / 20 = 11 minutes to reach 220 steps

Now, let's find how many steps Tom has gone up in 11 minutes:
* Tom goes up 25 steps per minute
* So in 11 minutes, Tom has gone up 25 * 11 = 275 steps

Answer: 275
