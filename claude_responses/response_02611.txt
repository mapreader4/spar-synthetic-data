Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Trevor is currently 11 years old.
2) Trevor's older brother is currently 20 years old.
3) We want to find out how old Trevor will be when his older brother is three times as old as Trevor is now.
4) To do this, we need to find out how many years it will take for Trevor's older brother to be three times as old as Trevor is now.
5) Trevor's older brother is currently 20 years old, and he needs to be 3 times as old as Trevor is now, which is 11 years old.
6) So, we need to find the difference between 3 times 11 (which is 33) and 20.
7) 33 - 20 = 13 years.
8) Therefore, in 13 years, Trevor's older brother will be three times as old as Trevor is now.
9) Trevor is currently 11 years old, so in 13 years, he will be 11 + 13 = 24 years old.

Answer: 24
