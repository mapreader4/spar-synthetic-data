Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cary needs to save $120 to buy the new pair of shoes
* He has already saved $30
* He earns $5 for every lawn he mows
* He mows 3 lawns each weekend

First, we need to calculate how much more money Cary needs to save:
* Total cost of the shoes: $120
* Amount Cary has already saved: $30
* Amount Cary still needs to save: $120 - $30 = $90

Next, we need to calculate how much money Cary earns each weekend:
* Cary earns $5 for each lawn he mows
* He mows 3 lawns each weekend
* So, he earns $5 x 3 = $15 each weekend

Now, we can calculate how many more weekends Cary needs to mow lawns to save the remaining $90:
* Cary earns $15 each weekend
* He needs to save $90 more
* $90 / $15 per weekend = 6 weekends

Answer: 6 more weekends
