Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Roy spends 2 hours on sports activities in school every day
* He goes to school 5 days a week
* He missed 2 days within a week

To calculate the total hours spent on sports in school that week, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of days he attended school that week
2. Multiply the number of days attended by the number of hours spent on sports each day

Step 1: 
* He goes to school 5 days a week
* He missed 2 days within a week
* So, he attended school 5 - 2 = 3 days that week

Step 2:
* He spends 2 hours on sports activities in school every day
* He attended school for 3 days that week
* So, the total hours spent on sports in school that week is 3 days x 2 hours/day = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
