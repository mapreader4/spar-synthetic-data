Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Randy has 1 more baseball glove than 7 times the number of bats he has.
* This means that the number of baseball gloves he has is equal to 7 times the number of bats plus 1.
* We are told that he has 29 baseball gloves.
* So we can set up an equation:
* 29 = 7x + 1, where x is the number of bats he has.
* Solving for x, we get:
* 29 - 1 = 7x
* 28 = 7x
* x = 4
