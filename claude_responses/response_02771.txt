Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeff plays tennis for 2 hours
* He scores a point every 5 minutes
* He wins a match when he scores 8 points

First, let's calculate how many points he can score in 2 hours:
* 2 hours = 120 minutes
* He scores a point every 5 minutes
* So, in 120 minutes, he can score 120 / 5 = 24 points

Now, to determine how many games he won, we need to divide the total points he scored by the number of points needed to win a game:
* He scored 24 points
* He needs 8 points to win a game
* 24 points / 8 points per game = 3 games won
