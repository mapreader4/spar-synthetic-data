Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James takes a spinning class 3 times a week
* Each class lasts 1.5 hours
* He burns 7 calories per minute

First, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends in the spinning class per week:
* 3 classes per week x 1.5 hours per class = 4.5 hours per week
* 4.5 hours per week x 60 minutes per hour = 270 minutes per week

Next, we need to calculate the number of calories he burns per week:
* 270 minutes per week x 7 calories per minute = 1,890 calories per week

Answer: 1,890 calories
