Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brendan wins all of the matches in the first 2 rounds
* Each round has 6 matches
* So in the first 2 rounds, Brendan won 6 matches in each round, which is 6 + 6 = 12 matches
* In the last round, there are 4 matches
* Brendan wins half of the 4 matches in the last round
* Half of 4 is 2
* So in the last round, Brendan won 2 matches
* To calculate the total number of matches Brendan won throughout the competition, we add the matches won in the first 2 rounds (12) and the matches won in the last round (2)
* 12 + 2 = 14

Answer: 14
