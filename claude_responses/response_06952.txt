Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lauren bought 2 pounds of hamburger meat at $3.50 per pound.
   * 2 pounds x $3.50 per pound = $7.00

2. She bought 1 pack of hamburger buns for $1.50.

3. She bought 1 head of lettuce for $1.00.

4. She bought a 1.5-pound tomato at $2.00 per pound.
   * 1.5 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $3.00

5. She bought a jar of pickles that cost $2.50, but she had a $1.00 off coupon.
   * $2.50 - $1.00 = $1.50

6. Now we add up all the items:
   * $7.00 + $1.50 + $1.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 = $14.00

7. Lauren paid with a $20 bill.
   * $20.00 - $14.00 = $6.00

Answer: $6
