Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brenda picks 250 peaches.
2) Only 60% of the peaches are fresh. To find the number of fresh peaches, we take 60% of 250:
   * 60% of 250 = 0.60 * 250 = 150 fresh peaches
3) Brenda has to throw away 15 peaches for being too small.
4) To find the number of peaches Brenda has left, we take the number of fresh peaches (150) and subtract the 15 peaches she had to throw away:
   * 150 - 15 = 135 peaches

Answer: 135
