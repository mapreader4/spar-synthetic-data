Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Richard can clean his room in 22 minutes.
2) Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard to clean her room, so Cory takes 22 + 3 = 25 minutes to clean her room.
3) Blake can clean his room 4 minutes more quickly than Cory, so Blake takes 25 - 4 = 21 minutes to clean his room.
4) They have to clean their rooms twice a week.
5) So, Richard spends 22 minutes x 2 = 44 minutes per week cleaning his room.
6) Cory spends 25 minutes x 2 = 50 minutes per week cleaning her room.
7) Blake spends 21 minutes x 2 = 42 minutes per week cleaning his room.
8) Adding up the time spent by all three:
44 minutes + 50 minutes + 42 minutes = 136 minutes per week.

Answer: 136 minutes.
