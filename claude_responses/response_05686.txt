Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Linda sold 7 tees at $8 each
* So the total revenue from the tees is: 7 x $8 = $56
* Linda also sold 4 jeans at $11 each
* So the total revenue from the jeans is: 4 x $11 = $44
* To calculate the total money Linda had at the end of the day, we add the revenue from the tees and the jeans:
* $56 + $44 = $100
Answer: $100
