Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of soap for every 1 cup of water.
2) The container can hold 40 ounces of liquid.
3) There are 8 ounces in a cup of water.
4) To find the number of cups of water that can fit in the 40-ounce container, we divide 40 ounces by 8 ounces per cup, which gives us 5 cups of water.
5) Since the recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of soap per 1 cup of water, and we have 5 cups of water, we need to multiply 3 tablespoons by 5 cups to get the total number of tablespoons of soap needed.
6) 3 tablespoons x 5 cups = 15 tablespoons of soap.

Answer: 15 tablespoons of soap.
