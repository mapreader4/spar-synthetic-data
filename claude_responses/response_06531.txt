Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cookfire starts with 6 logs
* It burns 3 logs every hour
* At the end of each hour, 2 more logs are added

After the first hour:
* 6 logs - 3 logs burned = 3 logs left
* 2 logs added
* Total logs = 3 + 2 = 5 logs

After the second hour:
* 5 logs - 3 logs burned = 2 logs left
* 2 logs added
* Total logs = 2 + 2 = 4 logs

After the third hour:
* 4 logs - 3 logs burned = 1 log left
* 2 logs added
* Total logs = 1 + 2 = 3 logs

Answer: 3 logs
