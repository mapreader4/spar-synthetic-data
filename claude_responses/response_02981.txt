Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackie walks 2 miles each day
* Jessie walks 1.5 miles each day
* We want to know how many more miles, in total, Jackie walks than Jessie in 6 days

To calculate this, we need to find the total distance walked by each person over the 6 days.

For Jackie:
* 2 miles per day x 6 days = 12 miles total

For Jessie:
* 1.5 miles per day x 6 days = 9 miles total

Now, we can calculate the difference between the total miles walked by Jackie and Jessie:
* 12 miles (Jackie) - 9 miles (Jessie) = 3 miles
