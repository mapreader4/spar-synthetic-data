Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* William can ride his horse for 6 hours a day
* Over 6 days, he only used the maximum riding time (6 hours) twice
* On two days, he rode his horse for only 1.5 hours a day
* For the next two days, he rode his horse for half the maximum time (3 hours)

Now, let's calculate the total hours he rode his horse during those 6 days:
* 2 days at 6 hours = 12 hours
* 2 days at 1.5 hours = 3 hours
* 2 days at 3 hours = 6 hours

Adding these up, we get:
* Total hours = 12 + 3 + 6 = 21 hours

Answer: 21 hours
