Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) If Lucy would give Linda $5, Lucy would have the same amount of money as Linda.
2) This means that after Lucy gives Linda $5, Lucy would have the same amount of money as Linda.
3) So, if Lucy originally had $20, and she gives Linda $5, then Lucy would have $20 - $5 = $15.
4) Since Lucy and Linda would have the same amount of money after the $5 transfer, Linda must have had $15 originally.

Answer: 15
