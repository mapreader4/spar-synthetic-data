Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first rose bush has 12 red flowers
* The second rose bush has 18 pink flowers
* The third rose bush has 20 yellow flowers
* The fourth rose bush has 8 orange flowers
* Lorelei picks 50% of the red roses, 50% of the pink roses, 25% of the yellow roses, and 25% of the orange roses

To calculate the number of roses in her vase:
* Red roses: 12 * 0.5 = 6 roses
* Pink roses: 18 * 0.5 = 9 roses
* Yellow roses: 20 * 0.25 = 5 roses
* Orange roses: 8 * 0.25 = 2 roses

Now we add up all the roses in her vase:
* 6 + 9 + 5 + 2 = 22 roses

Answer: 22
