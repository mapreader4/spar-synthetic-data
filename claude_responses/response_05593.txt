Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial costs before inflation:
   - Lumber: $450
   - Nails: $30
   - Fabric: $80
   - Total initial cost: $450 + $30 + $80 = $560

2. Inflation rates:
   - Lumber increased by 20%
   - Nails increased by 10%
   - Fabric increased by 5%

3. Calculating the new costs after inflation:
   - New lumber cost: $450 + (20% of $450) = $450 + $90 = $540
   - New nails cost: $30 + (10% of $30) = $30 + $3 = $33
   - New fabric cost: $80 + (5% of $80) = $80 + $4 = $84

4. Calculating the total new cost:
   - Total new cost: $540 + $33 + $84 = $657

5. Calculating the difference in cost:
   - Difference in cost: $657 - $560 = $97

Answer: $97
