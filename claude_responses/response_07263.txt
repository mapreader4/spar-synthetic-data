Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Sidney has 4 kittens and 3 adult cats
* Each adult cat eats 1 can of food per day
* Each kitten eats 3/4 of a can per day
* Sidney has 7 cans of cat food
* We need to find how many additional cans of food Sidney needs to buy to feed all of her animals for 7 days

First, let's calculate the total amount of food needed for 7 days:
* Adult cats: 3 cats x 1 can per day x 7 days = 21 cans
* Kittens: 4 kittens x 3/4 can per day x 7 days = 21 cans
* Total food needed = 21 + 21 = 42 cans

Now, let's calculate how many cans of food Sidney already has:
* Sidney has 7 cans of cat food

Finally, we can calculate the additional cans of food Sidney needs to buy:
* Additional cans needed = 42 cans - 7 cans = 35 cans

Answer: 35
