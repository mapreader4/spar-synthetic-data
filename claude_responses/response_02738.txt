Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Marj has 2 $20 bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40
2) Marj has 3 $5 bills, which is 3 x $5 = $15
3) Marj has $4.50 in loose coins
4) So the total amount of money Marj has in her wallet is $40 + $15 + $4.50 = $59.50
5) Marj buys a cake that costs $17.50
6) To calculate the amount of money left in her wallet, we subtract the cost of the cake from the total amount of money she had:
$59.50 - $17.50 = $42.00

Answer: $42
