Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie.
2) It takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile.
3) We want to find how long it will take Celia to run 30 miles.
4) Since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, it will take Celia half the time to run a mile compared to Lexie.
5) If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, then it will take Celia 10 minutes to run a mile.
6) To find the time it will take Celia to run 30 miles, we multiply the time it takes Celia to run 1 mile (10 minutes) by the number of miles (30).
7) 10 minutes per mile x 30 miles = 300 minutes.

Answer: 300 minutes.
