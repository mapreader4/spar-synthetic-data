Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. For the first 8 years, the cost per year is $10,000.
   * Total cost for the first 8 years = 8 x $10,000 = $80,000

2. After the first 8 years, the cost per year doubles to $20,000.
   * Remaining years = 18 - 8 = 10 years
   * Total cost for the remaining 10 years = 10 x $20,000 = $200,000

3. The total cost of raising the child up to 18 years old is:
   * $80,000 + $200,000 = $280,000

4. The university tuition cost is $250,000.

5. The total cost of raising the child and paying for university tuition is:
   * $280,000 + $250,000 = $530,000

6. Since John pays for half the cost, the total amount he pays is:
   * $530,000 / 2 = $265,000

Answer: $265,000
