Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Max has 5 points
* Dulce has 3 points
* Val has twice the combined points of Max and Dulce
* Max and Dulce's combined points = 5 + 3 = 8
* Val's points = 2 * 8 = 16
* Their team's total points = 5 + 3 + 16 = 24
* The opponents' team has a total of 40 points
* To find how many points their team is behind, we subtract their team's total points from the opponents' team's total points:
* 40 - 24 = 16

Answer: 16
