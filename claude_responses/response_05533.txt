Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The developer bought 4 acres of land at $1,863 per acre.
2) To calculate the total cost of the land, we multiply the number of acres (4) by the price per acre ($1,863):
4 acres x $1,863 per acre = $7,452 total cost of the land.
3) The developer then split the 4 acres of land into 9 lots.
4) To calculate the price per lot that the developer needs to sell each lot for to break even, we divide the total cost of the land ($7,452) by the number of lots (9):
$7,452 / 9 lots = $828 per lot.

Answer: $828
