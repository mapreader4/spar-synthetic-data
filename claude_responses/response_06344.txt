Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Daniel has 5 jars of juice, each containing 2 liters.
2) Each jar contains 2 liters, which is 2000 milliliters (1 liter = 1000 milliliters).
3) In total, Daniel has 5 jars x 2000 milliliters = 10,000 milliliters of juice.
4) Each glass can hold up to 250 milliliters of juice.
5) To find the number of full glasses he can give, we divide the total milliliters of juice by the capacity of each glass:
10,000 milliliters / 250 milliliters per glass = 40 full glasses.

Answer: 40
