Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total number of mice sold: 80
* Half of the sales are wireless mice, so that's 80 * 1/2 = 40 wireless mice
* One-fourth of the sales are optical mice, so that's 80 * 1/4 = 20 optical mice
* The remaining mice must be trackball mice

To find the number of trackball mice, we need to subtract the number of wireless and optical mice from the total:
* Total mice - wireless mice - optical mice = trackball mice
* 80 - 40 - 20 = 20

Therefore, the number of trackball mice sold is 20.

Answer: 20
