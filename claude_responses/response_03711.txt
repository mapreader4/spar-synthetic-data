Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Katherine has 4 apples
* She has 3 times as many pears as apples
* To find the number of pears, we multiply the number of apples by 3:
  * 4 apples x 3 = 12 pears
* Now we know Katherine has 4 apples and 12 pears
* The total number of pieces of fruit is 21
* To find the number of bananas, we need to subtract the number of apples and pears from the total number of pieces of fruit:
  * 21 total pieces of fruit - 4 apples - 12 pears = 5 bananas
