Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John spent 3 years exploring the jungle
* He then spent half as much time writing up notes about his travels
* To calculate the time spent on the notes, we take half of the time spent exploring:
  * Time spent on notes = 3 years / 2 = 1.5 years
* It then took 0.5 years to write the book once he was done with the notes

To find the total time spent on the book and exploring, we add up the time spent on each:
* Time spent exploring = 3 years
* Time spent on notes = 1.5 years
* Time spent writing the book = 0.5 years
* Total time = 3 years + 1.5 years + 0.5 years = 5 years
