Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Darla has 6 books in her locker.
2) Katie has half as many books as Darla. So, Katie has 6 / 2 = 3 books.
3) Darla and Katie have a combined total of 6 + 3 = 9 books.
4) Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined. So, Gary has 5 * 9 = 45 books.
5) The total number of books the three have is Darla's 6 books, plus Katie's 3 books, plus Gary's 45 books, which is 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books.

Answer: 54
