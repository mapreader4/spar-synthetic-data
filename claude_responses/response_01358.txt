Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jenny is having 80 guests at her wedding.
2) 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. This means that the number of guests wanting steak is 3 times the number of guests wanting chicken.
3) Let's call the number of guests wanting chicken 'x'. Then the number of guests wanting steak is 3x.
4) The total number of guests is 80, so x + 3x = 80. Solving for x, we get x = 20.
5) Therefore, the number of guests wanting steak is 3 * 20 = 60.
6) Each steak entree costs $25, and there are 60 steak entrees. So the total cost of the steak entrees is 60 * $25 = $1,500.
7) Each chicken entree costs $18, and there are 20 chicken entrees. So the total cost of the chicken entrees is 20 * $18 = $360.
8) The total catering budget is the sum of the steak and chicken entrees, which is $1,500 + $360 = $1,860.

Answer: $1,860
