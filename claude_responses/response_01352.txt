Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The fan can create an airflow of 10 liters per second
* The fan works for 10 minutes each day
* We want to calculate the amount of airflow it will create in one week

First, we need to convert the time the fan works each day from minutes to seconds:
* 10 minutes = 10 * 60 = 600 seconds

Next, we can calculate the amount of airflow the fan creates in one day:
* Airflow per day = 10 liters/second * 600 seconds = 6,000 liters

Finally, to calculate the amount of airflow in one week, we multiply the daily airflow by 7 days:
* Airflow in one week = 6,000 liters/day * 7 days = 42,000 liters

Answer: 42,000
