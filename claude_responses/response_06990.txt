Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah bought 5 pounds of rye flour
* Sarah bought 10 pounds of whole-wheat bread flour
* Sarah bought 3 pounds of chickpea flour
* Sarah already had 2 pounds of whole-wheat pastry flour at home

To calculate the total amount of flour Sarah now has, we need to add up all the flour she bought and the flour she already had:
* 5 pounds of rye flour
+ 10 pounds of whole-wheat bread flour
+ 3 pounds of chickpea flour
+ 2 pounds of whole-wheat pastry flour
= 20 pounds of flour

Answer: 20
