Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Linda has 24 classmates
* She wants to give each student 10 cookies
* So the total number of cookies she needs to make is 24 * 10 = 240 cookies
* Each cookie recipe makes 4 dozen cookies, which is 4 * 12 = 48 cookies
* Linda made 2 batches of chocolate chip cookies, which is 2 * 48 = 96 cookies
* She also made 1 batch of oatmeal raisin cookies, which is 48 cookies
* So the total number of cookies she has made so far is 96 + 48 = 144 cookies
* She still needs 240 - 144 = 96 more cookies
