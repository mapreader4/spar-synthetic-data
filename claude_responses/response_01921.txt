Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lisa has 36 candies total
* On Mondays and Wednesdays, she eats 2 candies per day
* On the other days of the week (Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays), she eats 1 candy per day

First, let's calculate how many candies she eats per week:
* Mondays and Wednesdays: 2 candies per day x 2 days = 4 candies
* Other days: 1 candy per day x 5 days = 5 candies
* Total candies eaten per week = 4 + 5 = 9 candies

Now, we can calculate how many weeks it will take for Lisa to eat all 36 candies:
* 36 candies / 9 candies per week = 4 weeks
