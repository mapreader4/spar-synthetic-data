Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, the restaurant sold 40 dinners.

2. On Tuesday, the restaurant sold 40 more dinners than it did on Monday. So, on Tuesday, the restaurant sold 40 + 40 = 80 dinners.

3. On Wednesday, the restaurant sold half the amount of dinners it sold on Tuesday. So, on Wednesday, the restaurant sold 80 / 2 = 40 dinners.

4. On Thursday, the restaurant changed their recipe and sold 3 more dinners than they did on Wednesday. So, on Thursday, the restaurant sold 40 + 3 = 43 dinners.

Now, to find the total number of dinners sold in those 4 days, we add up the dinners sold each day:
Monday: 40 dinners
Tuesday: 80 dinners
Wednesday: 40 dinners
Thursday: 43 dinners

Total dinners sold = 40 + 80 + 40 + 43 = 203 dinners

Answer: 203
