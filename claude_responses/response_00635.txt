Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The baker initially had 10 cheesecakes on display and 15 more in the fridge, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 cheesecakes.
2) The baker has sold 7 cheesecakes from the display.
3) To find the number of cheesecakes left to be sold, we need to subtract the number of cheesecakes sold (7) from the total number of cheesecakes (25).
4) 25 - 7 = 18 cheesecakes left to be sold.

Answer: 18
