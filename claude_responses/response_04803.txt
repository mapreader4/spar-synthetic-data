Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hannah needed 2 pounds of apples that were on sale for $2.00 per pound. So the cost of the apples is:
2 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $4.00
* The pre-made pie crust cost $2.00.
* The lemon cost $0.50.
* The butter cost $1.50.
* The total cost of the ingredients is:
$4.00 (apples) + $2.00 (pie crust) + $0.50 (lemon) + $1.50 (butter) = $8.00
* The pie is meant to serve 8 people, so to calculate the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by 8:
$8.00 / 8 = $1.00 per serving

Answer: $1.00
