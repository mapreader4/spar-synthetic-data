Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 people in the group (Jenny and 5 friends)
* Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entrée
* So the total cost for the tickets and entrées is:
    - 6 people x ($50 + $10) = 6 x $60 = $360
* Half the group (3 people) also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30 each
* So the total cost for the drink tickets is:
    - 3 people x $30 = $90
* The total initial cost for the group is:
    - $360 + $90 = $450
* Due to the cancellation, each person gets a 90% refund
* So the total refund amount is:
    - $450 x 0.90 = $405
* The amount of money the group lost is the initial cost minus the refund:
    - $450 - $405 = $45

Answer: $45
