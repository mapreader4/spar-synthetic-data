Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nancy buys 2 coffees a day
* In the morning, she buys a double espresso for $3.00
* In the afternoon, she buys an iced coffee for $2.50
* The total cost of her daily coffee purchases is $3.00 + $2.50 = $5.50
* She does this for 20 days
* To calculate the total amount spent, we multiply the daily cost ($5.50) by the number of days (20)
