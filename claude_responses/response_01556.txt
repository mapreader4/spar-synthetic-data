Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pizza was originally cut into 16 slices
* After Alyana and her friends finished eating, there were 4 slices left
* This means that 16 - 4 = 12 slices were eaten
* Each person ate 2 slices
* To find the number of people who ate the pizza, we divide the total number of slices eaten (12) by the number of slices each person ate (2)
* 12 รท 2 = 6

Therefore, the number of people who ate the pizza is 6.

Answer: 6
