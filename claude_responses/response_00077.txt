Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The boxer weighs 97 kg at 4 months from the fight.
2) The diet allows him to lose 3 kg per month until the day of the fight.
3) Since he has 4 months until the fight, he will lose 3 kg per month for 4 months.
4) The total weight loss over 4 months will be 3 kg x 4 months = 12 kg.
5) His weight on the day of the fight will be his initial weight (97 kg) minus the total weight loss (12 kg).

Answer: 85 kg
