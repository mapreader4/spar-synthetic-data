Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom filled up 3 times as many water balloons as Luke.
2) Luke filled up one fourth as many balloons as Anthony.
3) Anthony filled up 44 water balloons.

First, let's find out how many balloons Luke filled up:
* Since Luke filled up one fourth as many balloons as Anthony, and Anthony filled up 44 balloons, then Luke filled up 44 / 4 = 11 balloons.

Next, let's find out how many balloons Tom filled up:
* Since Tom filled up 3 times as many balloons as Luke, and Luke filled up 11 balloons, then Tom filled up 3 * 11 = 33 balloons.

Answer: 33
