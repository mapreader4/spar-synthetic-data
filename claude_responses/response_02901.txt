Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cat spends 20 minutes resisting the leash.
2) Jenny then coaxes the cat to walk 64 feet at a rate of 8 feet/minute.
3) To calculate the time it takes the cat to walk 64 feet at a rate of 8 feet/minute, we divide the distance by the rate:
64 feet / 8 feet/minute = 8 minutes
4) So the total time for the process is the time the cat spent resisting (20 minutes) plus the time it took the cat to walk the 64 feet (8 minutes).
Answer: 28 minutes
