Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that Quentin, Skylar, and Colten have a total of 383 chickens.
2) We also know that Quentin has 25 more than double the chickens that Skylar has. Let's call the number of chickens Skylar has as 'x'. Then, Quentin has 2x + 25 chickens.
3) Skylar has 4 less than triple the number of chickens that Colten has. Let's call the number of chickens Colten has as 'y'. Then, Skylar has 3y - 4 chickens.
4) We can set up an equation to solve for y:
Quentin's chickens + Skylar's chickens + Colten's chickens = 383
(2x + 25) + (3y - 4) + y = 383
2x + 3y + 21 = 383
3y = 362
y = 120.67

Since we are looking for the number of chickens Colten has, and the number of chickens must be an integer, the answer is:

Answer: 121
