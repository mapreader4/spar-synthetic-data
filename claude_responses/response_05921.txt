Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Freddy called his dad, who lives in the same city, for 45 minutes
* Local calls cost 5 cents per minute
* So the cost of the call to his dad is:
  * 45 minutes x 5 cents/minute = 225 cents
  * 225 cents = $2.25
* Freddy then called his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, for 31 minutes
* International calls cost 25 cents per minute
* So the cost of the call to his brother is:
  * 31 minutes x 25 cents/minute = 775 cents
  * 775 cents = $7.75
* To calculate the total amount Freddy spent:
  * $2.25 (call to dad) + $7.75 (call to brother) = $10.00

Answer: $10
