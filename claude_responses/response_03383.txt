Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Hannah's AdBlock blocks 80% of ads (100% - 20% = 80%)
* Of the remaining 20% of ads that aren't blocked, 20% of those are actually interesting
* That means 80% of the remaining 20% of ads are not interesting
* To calculate the percentage of ads that aren't interesting and don't get blocked, we need to take 80% of the 20% that aren't blocked:
* 80% of 20% = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16 = 16%

Answer: 16%
