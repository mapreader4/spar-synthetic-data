Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bart buys $10 worth of notepads.
2) Each notepad costs $1.25.
3) To find how many notepads he bought, we divide the total cost ($10) by the cost per notepad ($1.25):
$10 / $1.25 = 8 notepads
4) Each notepad has 60 pages.
5) To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of notepads (8) by the number of pages per notepad (60):
8 notepads x 60 pages/notepad = 480 pages

Answer: 480
