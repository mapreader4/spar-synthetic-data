Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Last week, Goldie worked for 20 hours
* She makes $5 per hour
* So, last week's earnings were:
    - 20 hours x $5 per hour = $100
* This week, Goldie worked for 30 hours
* Her earnings this week were:
    - 30 hours x $5 per hour = $150
* To calculate her total earnings for the two weeks, we add her earnings from last week and this week:
    - $100 + $150 = $250

Answer: $250
