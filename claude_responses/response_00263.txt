Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John plants a plot of 3 trees by 4 trees, so the total number of trees is 3 x 4 = 12 trees.
2) Each tree gives 5 apples, so the total number of apples is 12 trees x 5 apples per tree = 60 apples.
3) John sells each apple for $0.5, so the total amount of money he makes is 60 apples x $0.5 per apple = $30.

Answer: $30
