Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Mark's team:
* 25 2-pointers = 25 * 2 = 50 points
* 8 3-pointers = 8 * 3 = 24 points
* 10 free throws = 10 * 1 = 10 points
* Total points for Mark's team = 50 + 24 + 10 = 84 points

Opponents' team:
* 2-pointers: Double of Mark's team = 25 * 2 * 2 = 100 points
* 3-pointers: Half of Mark's team = 8 * 3 / 2 = 12 points
* Free throws: Half of Mark's team = 10 / 2 = 5 points
* Total points for opponents' team = 100 + 12 + 5 = 117 points

Now, to find the total number of points scored by both teams:
* Total points = Mark's team points + Opponents' team points
* Total points = 84 + 117 = 201 points

Answer: 201
