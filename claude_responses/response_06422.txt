Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Eric runs for 20 minutes and then jogs for 10 minutes to reach the park.
2) The total time it takes him to reach the park is 20 minutes + 10 minutes = 30 minutes.
3) When he returns home, he takes a different route that takes him 3 times as long as the trip there.
4) So, the time it takes him to return home is 3 times 30 minutes, which is 90 minutes.

Answer: 90
