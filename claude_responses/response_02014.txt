Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jennifer has already built 3 tanks that can hold 15 fish each
* So the total number of fish that can be housed in the 3 tanks is:
3 tanks x 15 fish per tank = 45 fish
* Jennifer needs to house a total of 75 fish
* So the number of additional fish that need to be housed is:
75 fish - 45 fish = 30 fish
* Each additional tank can hold 10 fish
* To determine how many more tanks Jennifer needs to build, we divide the remaining number of fish by the capacity of each tank:
30 fish / 10 fish per tank = 3 tanks

Therefore, Jennifer needs to build 3 more tanks to house a total of 75 fish.
