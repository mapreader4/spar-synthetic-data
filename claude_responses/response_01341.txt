Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sasha can complete 15 questions per hour
* She has 60 questions to complete
* She works for 2 hours

First, we calculate how many questions she can complete in 2 hours:
* 15 questions per hour x 2 hours = 30 questions

Now, we subtract the number of questions she can complete in 2 hours from the total number of questions she has to complete:
* 60 questions - 30 questions = 30 questions

Therefore, Sasha still needs to complete 30 questions.

Answer: 30
