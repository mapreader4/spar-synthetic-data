Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary bought a coat for James for $40
* She also bought two pairs of jeans for James
* She bought a pair of shoes for Jamie for $30
* The total cost of all the items was $110

We need to find the cost of one pair of jeans for James.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items for James:
* Coat for James: $40
* Two pairs of jeans for James: Unknown cost

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items for Jamie:
* Pair of shoes for Jamie: $30

The total cost of all the items was $110, so we can subtract the cost of the items for Jamie to get the cost of the items for James:
* Total cost: $110
* Cost of items for Jamie: $30
* Cost of items for James: $110 - $30 = $80

Now we know the total cost of the items for James is $80. We also know that the cost of the coat for James was $40. So the remaining $40 must be the cost of the two pairs of jeans.

Since the two pairs of jeans cost the same price, we can divide $40 by 2 to get the cost of one pair of jeans:
* Cost of one pair of jeans = $40 / 2 = $20

Answer: $20
