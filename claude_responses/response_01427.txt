Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. The initial number of dogs at the rescue center is 200.
2. Mr. Tanner agrees to bring in 100 more dogs from another rescue center.
3. After one week, 40 dogs are given out for adoption.
4. After a month, 60 more dogs are adopted.

To find the total number of remaining animals, we need to:
1. Add the initial 200 dogs and the 100 dogs brought in from the other rescue center: 200 + 100 = 300 dogs.
2. Subtract the 40 dogs given out for adoption after one week: 300 - 40 = 260 dogs.
3. Subtract the 60 dogs adopted after a month: 260 - 60 = 200 dogs.

Answer: 200
