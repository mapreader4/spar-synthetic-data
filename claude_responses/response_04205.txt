Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, Cohen saw 300 fish-eater birds at the lake.

2. On the second day, the number of birds doubled, so the number of birds seen was:
   300 x 2 = 600 birds

3. On the third day, the number of birds reduced by 200, so the number of birds seen was:
   600 - 200 = 400 birds

4. To find the total number of birds seen over the three days, we add the number of birds seen each day:
   300 + 600 + 400 = 1,300 birds

Answer: 1,300
