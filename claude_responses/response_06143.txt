Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Steve has 400 new emails in his inbox.
2) He moves half of them to the trash. Half of 400 is 200, so he moves 200 emails to the trash.
3) Now he has 400 - 200 = 200 emails remaining in his inbox.
4) He then moves 40% of the remaining 200 emails to his work folder. 40% of 200 is 0.4 * 200 = 80 emails.
5) So he has 200 - 80 = 120 emails left in his inbox.

Answer: 120
