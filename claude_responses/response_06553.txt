Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elois needs 4 bananas to make 1 loaf of banana bread
* On Monday, she makes 3 loaves of banana bread
* To make 3 loaves of banana bread, she needs:
  * 3 loaves x 4 bananas per loaf = 12 bananas
* On Tuesday, she makes twice as many loaves of banana bread as Monday
* On Monday, she made 3 loaves
* So on Tuesday, she made 2 x 3 = 6 loaves of banana bread
* To make 6 loaves of banana bread, she needs:
  * 6 loaves x 4 bananas per loaf = 24 bananas
* To calculate the total number of bananas used:
  * Bananas used on Monday: 12
  * Bananas used on Tuesday: 24
  * Total bananas used = 12 + 24 = 36

Answer: 36
