Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are a total of 120 people who attended the party
* 1/3 of the 120 people are men
* To calculate the number of men, we take 1/3 of 120:
    * 1/3 of 120 = 120 * (1/3) = 40 men
* Half of the 120 people are women
* To calculate the number of women, we take 1/2 of 120:
    * 1/2 of 120 = 120 * (1/2) = 60 women
* The rest of the people must be children
* To calculate the number of children, we take the total (120) and subtract the number of men (40) and the number of women (60):
    * 120 - 40 - 60 = 20 children

Answer: 20
