Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The concert ticket costs $181.
2) Jenna also wants to buy 5 drink tickets at $7 each, so that's 5 x $7 = $35.
3) The total cost of the outing is $181 + $35 = $216.
4) Jenna earns $18 an hour and works 30 hours a week, so her weekly salary is $18 x 30 = $540.
5) Her monthly salary is $540 x 4 = $2,160.
6) The percentage of her monthly salary that she will spend on this outing is:
$216 / $2,160 = 0.1

Answer: 10%
