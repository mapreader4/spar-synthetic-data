Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Macy's goal is to run a total of 24 miles per week
* She runs 3 miles per day
* We want to know how many miles she has left to run after 6 days

First, let's calculate how many miles she has run in 6 days:
* 3 miles per day x 6 days = 18 miles

Now, we can subtract the miles she has run from her weekly goal to find the remaining miles:
* 24 miles (weekly goal) - 18 miles (miles run) = 6 miles

Therefore, Macy has 6 miles left to run after 6 days in order to meet her weekly goal.

Answer: 6
