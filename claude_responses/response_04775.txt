Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In 7 years, Kaylee will be 3 times as old as Matt is now.
* Matt is currently 5 years old.
* In 7 years, Matt will be 5 + 7 = 12 years old.
* Since Kaylee will be 3 times as old as Matt is now, that means in 7 years Kaylee will be 3 * 5 = 15 years old.
* Therefore, Kaylee's current age is 15 - 7 = 8 years old.
