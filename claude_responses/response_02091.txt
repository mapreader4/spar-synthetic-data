Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The store has an 8% discount on all items.
2) Shara paid $184 for a pair of shoes.
3) To find the original price of the shoes before the discount, we can use the formula:
Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Rate)
4) Plugging in the values, we get:
Original Price = $184 / (1 - 0.08)
5) Simplifying, we get:
Original Price = $184 / 0.92
6) Calculating, we get:
Original Price = $200
7) The amount Shara saved is the difference between the original price and the discounted price:
Amount Saved = Original Price - Discounted Price
8) Plugging in the values, we get:
Amount Saved = $200 - $184 = $16

Answer: $16
