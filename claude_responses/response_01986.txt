Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) $240 was divided between Kelvin and Samuel.
2) Samuel received 3/4 of the money.
3) To find how much Samuel received, we take 3/4 of $240:
3/4 * $240 = $180
4) From his share of $180, Samuel then spent 1/5 of the original $240 on drinks.
5) To find how much Samuel spent on drinks, we take 1/5 of $240:
1/5 * $240 = $48
6) So Samuel spent $48 on drinks.
7) To find how much Samuel has left, we subtract the amount he spent on drinks from his original share:
$180 - $48 = $132

Answer: $132
