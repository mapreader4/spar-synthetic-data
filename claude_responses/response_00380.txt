Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Patrick is half the age of his elder brother Robert.
2) Robert will turn 30 after 2 years.
3) This means that Robert is currently 28 years old (30 - 2 = 28).
4) Since Patrick is half the age of Robert, this means that Patrick is currently 14 years old (28 / 2 = 14).
