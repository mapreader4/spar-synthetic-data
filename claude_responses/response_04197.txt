Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each sweater takes 4 balls of yarn.
2) Each ball of yarn costs $6.
3) So the cost of yarn for each sweater is 4 x $6 = $24.
4) Chantal is selling each sweater for $35.
5) She is making 28 sweaters.
6) The total revenue from selling 28 sweaters at $35 each is 28 x $35 = $980.
7) The total cost of yarn for 28 sweaters is 28 x $24 = $672.
8) The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $980 - $672 = $308.

Answer: $308
