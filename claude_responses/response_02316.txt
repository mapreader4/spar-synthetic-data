Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary brought 50 stickers to class.
2) She gave 4 stickers to each of her 5 friends. That's 4 x 5 = 20 stickers given to her friends.
3) She gave everyone else in class two stickers each. We don't know how many students are in the class yet, but we know she has 8 stickers left over.
4) So the total number of stickers she gave out to the other students (not including her friends) is 50 - 20 - 8 = 22 stickers.
5) Since she gave each of the other students 2 stickers, we can divide the total number of stickers given out to the other students (22) by 2 to get the number of other students in the class.
6) 22 / 2 = 11 other students in the class.
7) Adding the 5 friends and Mary herself, the total number of students in the class is 5 + 1 + 11 = 17.
