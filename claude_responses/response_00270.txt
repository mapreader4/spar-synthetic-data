Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ayla talks with each customer for 1 hour
* Each call is charged 5 cents per minute
* Ayla talks to 50 customers per week

First, let's calculate the cost per call:
* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* 60 minutes x 5 cents per minute = 300 cents per call
* 300 cents per call = $3 per call

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the week:
* 50 customers per week x $3 per call = $150 per week

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for the month:
* Assuming 4 weeks in a month, the total cost for the month would be:
* $150 per week x 4 weeks = $600 per month

Answer: $600
