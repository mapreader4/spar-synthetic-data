Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The painting is 2 feet by 4 feet, which means the area of the painting is 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet.
2) The wall is 5 feet by 10 feet, which means the area of the wall is 5 feet * 10 feet = 50 square feet.
3) To calculate the percentage of the wall taken up by the painting, we divide the area of the painting by the area of the wall and multiply by 100:
(8 square feet / 50 square feet) * 100 = 16%

Answer: 16
