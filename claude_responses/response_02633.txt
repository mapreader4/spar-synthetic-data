Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, the bird watcher saw 70 birds.

2. On Tuesday, the bird watcher saw half as many birds as he did on Monday. So, if he saw 70 birds on Monday, he would have seen 70 / 2 = 35 birds on Tuesday.

3. On Wednesday, the bird watcher saw 8 more birds than he did on Tuesday. So, if he saw 35 birds on Tuesday, he would have seen 35 + 8 = 43 birds on Wednesday.

Now, to calculate the total number of birds the bird watcher saw from Monday to Wednesday, we add up the number of birds seen each day:

Monday: 70 birds
Tuesday: 35 birds
Wednesday: 43 birds

Total number of birds seen = 70 + 35 + 43 = 148 birds

Answer: 148
