Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total number of books in the library is 2300.
2) 80% of the books are in English. To calculate this, we take 80% of 2300:
   * 80% of 2300 = 0.8 * 2300 = 1840 books in English
3) 60% of the English books were published in the country. To calculate this, we take 60% of 1840:
   * 60% of 1840 = 0.6 * 1840 = 1104 books published in the country
4) To find the number of English-language books published outside the country, we subtract the number of books published in the country from the total number of English books:
   * 1840 - 1104 = 736 books published outside the country

Answer: 736
