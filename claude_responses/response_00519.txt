Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harrison buys a regular croissant on Saturdays for $3.50
* He buys an almond croissant on Sundays for $5.50
* We need to calculate how much he spends on croissants in a year

First, let's calculate how much he spends on Saturdays:
* There are 52 Saturdays in a year
* Each regular croissant costs $3.50
* So, the total cost for Saturdays is 52 * $3.50 = $182

Next, let's calculate how much he spends on Sundays:
* There are 52 Sundays in a year
* Each almond croissant costs $5.50
* So, the total cost for Sundays is 52 * $5.50 = $286

Finally, to get the total amount he spends on croissants in a year, we add the Saturday and Sunday costs:
* $182 + $286 = $468

Answer: 468
