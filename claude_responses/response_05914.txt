Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Salaria has 50% of tree A and 50% of tree B.
2. Tree A gives her 10 oranges a month, and 60% of them are good.
   * So, for Tree A, she gets 10 * 0.6 = 6 good oranges per month.
3. Tree B gives her 15 oranges a month, and 1/3 of them are good.
   * So, for Tree B, she gets 15 * (1/3) = 5 good oranges per month.
4. In total, she gets 6 + 5 = 11 good oranges per month from both types of trees.
5. We know that she gets 55 good oranges per month.
6. To find the total number of trees, we need to set up an equation:
   * 11 good oranges per month / tree = 55 good oranges per month
   * Therefore, the total number of trees = 55 / 11 = 5 trees

Answer: 5 trees
