Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 5 notebooks
* Each notebook has 40 pages
* So the total number of pages in the 5 notebooks is 5 * 40 = 200 pages
* John uses 4 pages per day
* To find how many days the notebooks last, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages used per day:
* 200 pages / 4 pages per day = 50 days

Answer: 50
