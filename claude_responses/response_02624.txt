Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maria received a 25% discount on her purchase.
2) The discount she received was $40.
3) To find the original price before the discount, we can use the formula:
Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Rate)
4) Plugging in the values, we get:
Original Price = $40 / (1 - 0.25)
5) Simplifying, we get:
Original Price = $40 / 0.75
6) Solving for the original price, we get:
Original Price = $53.33
7) Therefore, the total amount Maria paid is the original price minus the discount, which is:
$53.33 - $40 = $13.33
