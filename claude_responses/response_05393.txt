Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The kitchen module is 400 square feet and costs $20,000.
2. The bathroom module is 150 square feet and costs $12,000.
3. All other modules cost $100 per square foot.
4. Denny plans to build a 2,000 square foot modular home with one kitchen and two bathrooms.

To calculate the total cost:
* Kitchen module cost: $20,000
* Bathroom module cost: 2 x $12,000 = $24,000
* Remaining square footage: 2,000 - 400 - (2 x 150) = 1,300 square feet
* Cost of remaining modules: 1,300 x $100 = $130,000

Total cost = Kitchen module + Bathroom modules + Remaining modules
Total cost = $20,000 + $24,000 + $130,000 = $174,000

Answer: $174,000
