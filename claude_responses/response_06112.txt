Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The manicure cost $30
* Tim tipped the beautician 30% of the cost of the manicure
* To calculate the tip, we take 30% of $30:
    * 30% of $30 = 0.30 x $30 = $9
* To calculate the total amount Tim paid, we add the cost of the manicure ($30) and the tip ($9):
    * $30 + $9 = $39

Answer: $39
