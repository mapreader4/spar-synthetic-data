Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Frank bought 5 chocolate bars and 2 bags of chips
* Each chocolate bar costs $2
* So the total cost of the 5 chocolate bars is 5 * $2 = $10
* Frank handed the cashier $20 and received $4 back as change
* Therefore, the total amount Frank paid was $20 - $4 = $16
* Since the chocolate bars cost $10, the remaining amount must have been the cost of the 2 bags of chips
* So the cost of the 2 bags of chips is $16 - $10 = $6
* Since there are 2 bags of chips, each bag of chips must have cost $6 / 2 = $3

Answer: $3
