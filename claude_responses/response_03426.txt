Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lorie starts with 2 pieces of $100 bills.
2) He requests to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. So now he has 1 piece of $100 bill and 2 pieces of $50 bills.
3) Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills. So, $50 is changed into 5 pieces of $10 bills.
4) The rest of the $50 from the $100 bill is changed to $5 bills. So, $50 is changed into 10 pieces of $5 bills.
5) In total, Lorie now has:
   - 1 piece of $100 bill
   - 2 pieces of $50 bills
   - 5 pieces of $10 bills
   - 10 pieces of $5 bills
Answer: 18 pieces of bills.
