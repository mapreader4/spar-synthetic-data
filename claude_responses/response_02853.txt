Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each episode is 20 minutes long
* It takes 50% longer to film each episode, which means it takes 30 minutes to film each episode (20 minutes + 50% of 20 minutes)
* Each week they show 5 episodes
* To find the total time to film 4 weeks of episodes, we need to:
1. Calculate the total time to film 1 week of episodes:
   * 5 episodes per week x 30 minutes per episode = 150 minutes per week
2. Convert the total time per week to hours:
   * 150 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 2.5 hours per week
3. Multiply the time per week by 4 weeks:
   * 2.5 hours per week x 4 weeks = 10 hours

Answer: 10 hours
