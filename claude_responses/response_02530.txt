Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Katie's family eats 3 dozen donuts
* Each donut requires 2 ounces of coffee to dunk it
* So for 3 dozen donuts (36 donuts), they need 36 * 2 = 72 ounces of coffee
* Each pot of coffee contains 12 ounces
* So they need 72 ounces / 12 ounces per pot = 6 pots of coffee
* Each pot of coffee costs $3 to make
* So for 6 pots of coffee, the total cost is 6 * $3 = $18

Answer: $18
