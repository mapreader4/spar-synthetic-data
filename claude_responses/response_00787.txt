Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eden carried 4 buckets of sand
* Mary carried 3 more buckets of sand than Eden, so Mary carried 4 + 3 = 7 buckets of sand
* Iris carried 1 less bucket of sand than Mary, so Iris carried 7 - 1 = 6 buckets of sand
* Each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand

Now, let's calculate the total amount of sand collected:
* Eden carried 4 buckets x 2 pounds/bucket = 8 pounds
* Mary carried 7 buckets x 2 pounds/bucket = 14 pounds
* Iris carried 6 buckets x 2 pounds/bucket = 12 pounds

To find the total amount of sand collected, we add up the amounts for each person:
* Total sand collected = 8 pounds + 14 pounds + 12 pounds = 34 pounds

Answer: 34
