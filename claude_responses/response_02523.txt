Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.
2) He then gets his wife a ring that is twice the cost of the first ring, which is 2 x $10,000 = $20,000.
3) He then sells the first ring for half its value, which is 0.5 x $10,000 = $5,000.

To calculate how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up the cost of the two rings and subtract the amount he received from selling the first ring:
Total cost of rings: $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000
Amount received from selling first ring: $5,000
Amount out of pocket: $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000

Answer: $25,000
