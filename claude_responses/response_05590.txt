Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The forest has 5000 palm trees.
2) The desert has 3/5 fewer palm trees than the forest.
3) To find the number of palm trees in the desert, we need to subtract 3/5 of 5000 from 5000.
4) 3/5 of 5000 is 3/5 * 5000 = 3000.
5) 5000 - 3000 = 2000 palm trees in the desert.
6) The total number of palm trees in both the desert and the forest is 5000 + 2000 = 7000.

Answer: 7000
