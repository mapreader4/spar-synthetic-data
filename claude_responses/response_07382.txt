Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 people in Tommy's family
* Each person wants one pound of steak
* Each steak is 20 ounces

First, we need to convert the desired amount of steak per person from pounds to ounces:
* 1 pound = 16 ounces
* So 1 pound of steak per person = 16 ounces per person

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of steak needed for the 5 people:
* 16 ounces per person x 5 people = 80 ounces of steak needed

Finally, we need to determine how many 20-ounce steaks Tommy needs to buy to get 80 ounces of steak:
* 80 ounces / 20 ounces per steak = 4 steaks needed
