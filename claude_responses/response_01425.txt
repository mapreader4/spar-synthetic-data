Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Betty makes 10 cupcakes per hour
* Dora makes 8 cupcakes per hour
* Betty took a 2-hour break
* We want to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours

First, let's calculate how many cupcakes each of them made in the 5 hours:
* Betty worked for 3 hours (5 hours - 2 hour break)
* In 3 hours, Betty made 10 cupcakes per hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes
* Dora worked for 5 hours
* In 5 hours, Dora made 8 cupcakes per hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes

Now, we can find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made:
* Dora made 40 cupcakes
* Betty made 30 cupcakes
* The difference is 40 - 30 = 10 cupcakes

Answer: 10
