Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John can play 200 beats per minute
* He plays for 2 hours a day
* He plays for 3 days

To find the total number of beats he plays, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of beats per hour:
   * 200 beats per minute x 60 minutes per hour = 12,000 beats per hour
2. Calculate the number of beats per day:
   * 12,000 beats per hour x 2 hours per day = 24,000 beats per day
3. Calculate the total number of beats over 3 days:
   * 24,000 beats per day x 3 days = 72,000 beats

Answer: 72,000
