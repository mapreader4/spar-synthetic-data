Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Carly trimmed 164 nails in total
* Each dog has 4 paws, and each paw has 4 nails
* So, for each dog, Carly would have trimmed 4 x 4 = 16 nails
* However, 3 of the dogs had only 3 legs, so Carly would have trimmed 3 x 3 = 9 nails for each of those dogs
* So, the total number of nails trimmed for the 3 dogs with 3 legs is 3 x 9 = 27 nails
* The remaining nails, 164 - 27 = 137, were trimmed from dogs with 4 legs
* Since each dog with 4 legs had 16 nails trimmed, we can divide 137 by 16 to get the number of dogs with 4 legs:
* 137 / 16 = 8.5625
* Since we can't have a fractional number of dogs, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 8 dogs
* Therefore, the total number of dogs Carly worked on is 8 + 3 = 11 dogs.
