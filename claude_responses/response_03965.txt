Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dallas picked 14 bags of apples and 9 bags of pears
* Austin picked 6 bags of apples more than Dallas
* Dallas picked 14 bags of apples, so Austin picked 14 + 6 = 20 bags of apples
* Austin picked 5 fewer bags of pears than Dallas
* Dallas picked 9 bags of pears, so Austin picked 9 - 5 = 4 bags of pears
* To find the total number of bags of fruit Austin picked, we add the number of bags of apples and pears:
* Austin picked 20 bags of apples and 4 bags of pears
* Total bags of fruit picked by Austin = 20 + 4 = 24

Answer: 24
