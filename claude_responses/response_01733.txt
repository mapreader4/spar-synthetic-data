Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Adam initially donates:
   - 4 pairs of pants
   - 4 jumpers
   - 4 pajama sets (8 articles of clothing)
   - 20 t-shirts
   - Total from Adam: 4 + 4 + 8 + 20 = 36 articles of clothing

2. 3 of Adam's friends donate the same amount as Adam, which is 36 articles each.
   - Total from 3 friends: 3 x 36 = 108 articles of clothing

3. Adam decides to keep half of his clothes, so the remaining half is donated.
   - Remaining clothes from Adam: 36 / 2 = 18 articles of clothing

4. Total articles of clothing being donated:
   - From Adam: 18 articles
   - From 3 friends: 108 articles
   - Total: 18 + 108 = 126 articles of clothing

Answer: 126
