Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John jogs at a speed of 4 miles per hour when he runs alone
* John runs at 6 miles per hour when he is being dragged by his 100-pound German Shepherd dog
* John and his dog go on a run together for 30 minutes
* Then, John runs for an additional 30 minutes by himself

First, let's calculate the distance John and his dog traveled together:
* They ran for 30 minutes
* John's speed when being dragged by the dog is 6 miles per hour
* So, the distance traveled together is:
    * (6 miles per hour) * (0.5 hours) = 3 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance John traveled by himself:
* He ran for an additional 30 minutes
* His speed when running alone is 4 miles per hour
* So, the distance traveled alone is:
    * (4 miles per hour) * (0.5 hours) = 2 miles

Finally, to get the total distance traveled, we add the distance traveled together and the distance traveled alone:
* Total distance = 3 miles + 2 miles = 5 miles

Answer: 5 miles
