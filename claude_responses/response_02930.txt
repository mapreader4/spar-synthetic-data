Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The aqua park charges $12 for admission and $6 for a tour
* The first group has 10 people and they take the tour
* For the first group:
    - 10 people x $12 admission = $120
    - 10 people x $6 tour = $60
    - Total for first group = $120 + $60 = $180
* The second group has 5 people and they only go to the aquarium
    - 5 people x $12 admission = $60
    - Total for second group = $60
* To calculate the total earnings for the aqua park:
    - Total earnings = $180 + $60 = $240

Answer: 240
