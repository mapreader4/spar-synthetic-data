Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Era had 5 burgers
* Each burger was sliced into halves, so there were 10 slices in total (5 burgers x 2 slices per burger)
* The first friend got 1 slice
* The second friend got 2 slices
* The third friend got 3 slices
* The fourth friend got 3 slices
* So the total number of slices taken by the friends is:
  - 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9 slices
* The number of slices left for Era is the total number of slices (10) minus the number of slices taken by the friends (9)
* 10 - 9 = 1 slice left for Era
