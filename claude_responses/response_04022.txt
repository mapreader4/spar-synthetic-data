Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James spends 30 minutes twice a day on meditation
* This means he spends 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening, for a total of 60 minutes per day
* There are 7 days in a week
* So, in a week, James spends:
    - 60 minutes per day x 7 days = 420 minutes per week
* To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
    - 420 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 7 hours per week

Answer: 7 hours
