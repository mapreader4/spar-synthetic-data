Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Olive charged her phone for 10 hours last night
* Each hour of charge lasts the phone 2 hours of use
* So, if Olive charged her phone for 10 hours, she would get 10 x 2 = 20 hours of use from that charge
* Now, Olive is going to charge her phone for 3/5 of the time she charged it last night
* 3/5 of 10 hours is 3/5 x 10 = 6 hours
* So, if Olive charges her phone for 6 hours, she will get 6 x 2 = 12 hours of use from that charge

Answer: 12 hours
