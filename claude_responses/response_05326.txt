Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Colin ran his first mile in 6 minutes.
* He then ran the next two miles in 5 minutes each, which is 10 minutes total.
* He finished his 4th mile in 4 minutes.
* To calculate the average time it took him to run a mile, we need to add up the times for all 4 miles and divide by 4.
* The total time for all 4 miles is 6 + 10 + 4 = 20 minutes.
* Dividing the total time of 20 minutes by 4 miles gives us an average time of 5 minutes per mile.
