Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Steven has three trucks that can each carry up to 2,000 pounds of cargo
* The boxes come in two weights: 10 pounds and 40 pounds
* The customer has ordered equal quantities of both the lighter and heavier products
* Since partially filled boxes can't be shipped, we need to find the maximum number of complete boxes that can be shipped in each delivery

First, let's calculate the total weight capacity of the three trucks:
* 3 trucks x 2,000 pounds per truck = 6,000 pounds total capacity

Now, let's consider the weight of the boxes:
* 10 pound boxes and 40 pound boxes
* The customer has ordered equal quantities of both
* So we need to ship an equal number of 10 pound and 40 pound boxes

The total weight of the boxes shipped must be less than or equal to the total truck capacity of 6,000 pounds.
* Let x = number of 10 pound boxes
* Let y = number of 40 pound boxes
* Total weight = 10x + 40y ≤ 6,000 pounds
* Since x = y, we can substitute y for x:
* 10y + 40y ≤ 6,000
* 50y ≤ 6,000
* y ≤ 120

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be shipped in each delivery is 120 boxes of each type, for a total of 240 boxes.

Answer: 240
