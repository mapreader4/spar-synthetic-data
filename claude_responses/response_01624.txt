Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A kilogram of pork costs $6
* A kilogram of chicken costs $2 less than a kilogram of pork
* So, a kilogram of chicken costs $6 - $2 = $4
* We need to find the cost of 3 kilograms of chicken and 1 kilogram of pork
* 3 kilograms of chicken at $4 per kilogram costs 3 * $4 = $12
* 1 kilogram of pork at $6 per kilogram costs $6
* The total cost is $12 + $6 = $18
