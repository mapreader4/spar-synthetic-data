Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Luke catches 2 fish every day
* He does this for 30 days
* Each fish gives him 2 fillets

To calculate the total number of fish fillets, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of fish caught:
   * 2 fish per day x 30 days = 60 fish
2. Calculate the total number of fillets:
   * 60 fish x 2 fillets per fish = 120 fillets

Answer: 120
