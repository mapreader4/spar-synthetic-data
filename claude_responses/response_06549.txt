Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In January, Benny added $19 to the piggy bank.
* In February, Benny added the same amount as in January, which is $19.
* By the end of March, Benny has $46 in the piggy bank.

To find how much Benny added in March, we need to calculate the total amount he had in the piggy bank before March, and then subtract that from the $46 he had at the end of March.

The total amount he had before March is:
* January: $19
* February: $19
* Total before March: $19 + $19 = $38

Now we can subtract the amount before March from the total at the end of March:
* $46 - $38 = $8

Therefore, Benny added $8 to the piggy bank in March.

Answer: 8
