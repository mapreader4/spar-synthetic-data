Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A herring has 40 oz of fat
* An eel has 20 oz of fat
* A pike has 10 more oz of fat than an eel, so a pike has 20 + 10 = 30 oz of fat
* Ellianna cooked and served 40 fish of each type

To calculate the total ounces of fat served, we need to:
1. Calculate the total fat from the herrings:
   * 40 oz of fat per herring x 40 herrings = 1,600 oz of fat
2. Calculate the total fat from the eels:
   * 20 oz of fat per eel x 40 eels = 800 oz of fat
3. Calculate the total fat from the pikes:
   * 30 oz of fat per pike x 40 pikes = 1,200 oz of fat

Now we add up the total fat from all three types of fish:
* 1,600 oz + 800 oz + 1,200 oz = 3,600 oz of fat

Answer: 3,600
