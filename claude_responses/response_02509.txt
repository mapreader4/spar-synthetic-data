* Sam spends 80 minutes studying Math
* Sam spends 40 minutes studying Literature
* To find the total time spent studying, we add up the time spent on each subject:
* 60 minutes + 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 180 minutes
* To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60:
* 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours
