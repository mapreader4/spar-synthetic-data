Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nadine spends 10 minutes hosing off her dog outside.
2) She then shampoos her dog three times.
3) Each shampoo takes 15 minutes.
4) So the total time spent shampooing the dog is 3 x 15 minutes = 45 minutes.
5) Adding the time spent hosing the dog (10 minutes) and the time spent shampooing the dog (45 minutes), the total time spent cleaning the dog is:
10 minutes + 45 minutes = 55 minutes.
