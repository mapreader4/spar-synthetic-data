Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jude bought 3 chairs at the same price
* He also bought a table for $50 and two sets of plates at $20 each
* He paid the cashier $130 and received $4 in change
* To find the cost of each chair, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract the amount he paid from that total

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
* 3 chairs at the same price
* 1 table for $50
* 2 sets of plates at $20 each, so 2 x $20 = $40
* Total cost = cost of 3 chairs + $50 + $40 = cost of 3 chairs + $90

Next, we know that Jude paid $130 and received $4 in change, so the amount he actually paid was $130 - $4 = $126.

Now we can set up an equation to solve for the cost of each chair:
* Total cost = cost of 3 chairs + $90
* $126 = cost of 3 chairs + $90
* Cost of 3 chairs = $126 - $90 = $36
* Cost of each chair = $36 / 3 = $12

Answer: $12
