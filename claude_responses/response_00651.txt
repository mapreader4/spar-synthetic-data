Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Olivia earns $9 per hour
* On Monday, she worked 4 hours
* On Wednesday, she worked 3 hours
* On Friday, she worked 6 hours
* To calculate her total earnings for the week, we need to add up the earnings from each day:
* Monday: 4 hours x $9 per hour = $36
* Wednesday: 3 hours x $9 per hour = $27
* Friday: 6 hours x $9 per hour = $54
* Adding up the earnings from each day:
* $36 + $27 + $54 = $117
