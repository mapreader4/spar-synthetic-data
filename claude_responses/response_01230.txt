Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Casey has 10 toenails and 10 fingernails, for a total of 20 nails.
* For each nail, she needs to apply:
  1. Base coat (20 minutes)
  2. Coat of paint (20 minutes)
  3. Coat of glitter (20 minutes)
* Each coat takes 20 minutes to apply and 20 minutes to dry before the next coat can be applied.
* So for each nail, the total time is:
  * Base coat (20 minutes) + 20 minutes drying time
  * Paint coat (20 minutes) + 20 minutes drying time
  * Glitter coat (20 minutes) + 20 minutes drying time
  * Total time per nail = 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 120 minutes
* Since there are 20 nails, the total time to decorate all nails is:
  * 20 nails x 120 minutes per nail = 2,400 minutes

Answer: 2,400 minutes
