Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Loris needs 3 more books to have the same number as Lamont.
2) Lamont has twice the number of books that Darryl has.
3) Darryl has 20 books.
4) So, Lamont has 2 x 20 = 40 books.
5) Loris needs 3 more books to have the same number as Lamont, so Loris has 40 - 3 = 37 books.
6) The total number of books the three have is Darryl's 20 books, plus Lamont's 40 books, plus Loris' 37 books.
7) The total number of books is 20 + 40 + 37 = 97.

Answer: 97
