Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 3 fireflies dancing in the evening breeze.
* Then, 4 less than a dozen (which is 8) more fireflies joined them.
* So, the total number of fireflies at this point was 3 + 8 = 11.
* Finally, 2 of the fireflies flew away.
* Therefore, the number of fireflies that remained is 11 - 2 = 9.
