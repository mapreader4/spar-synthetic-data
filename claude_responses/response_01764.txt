Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The commercial Cod fishing season in Alaska lasts 7 months, or 213 days on a non-leap year.

2. The first fisherman plans to catch fish at a steady rate of 3 per day for the entire season.
   * Total fish caught by the first fisherman = 3 fish/day x 213 days = 639 fish

3. The second fisherman plans to catch:
   * 1 fish per day for the first 30 days = 1 fish/day x 30 days = 30 fish
   * 2 fish per day for the next 60 days = 2 fish/day x 60 days = 120 fish
   * 4 fish per day for the remaining 123 days = 4 fish/day x 123 days = 492 fish
   * Total fish caught by the second fisherman = 30 + 120 + 492 = 642 fish

4. The fisherman who catches the higher number of fish is the second fisherman, who caught 642 fish.

5. The difference between the number of fish caught by the two fishermen is:
   * 642 fish (second fisherman) - 639 fish (first fisherman) = 3 fish
