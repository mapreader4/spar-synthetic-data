Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The game promises 100 hours of gameplay
* 80% of that 100 hours is "boring grinding"
* So, the boring grinding part is 80% of 100 hours, which is 80 hours
* The expansion adds 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay
* Therefore, the total enjoyable gameplay is the remaining 20% of the original 100 hours, plus the 30 hours from the expansion
* 20% of 100 hours is 20 hours
* 20 hours + 30 hours = 50 hours

Answer: 50 hours
