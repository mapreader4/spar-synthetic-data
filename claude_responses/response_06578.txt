Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The library originally had 9,900 books.
2) Over the summer, they sold some books.
3) After the sales, only four sixths of the books are left.
4) To find the number of books sold, we need to find the difference between the original number of books and the number of books left.
5) The number of books left is four sixths of the original 9,900 books.
6) Four sixths of 9,900 is (4/6) * 9,900 = 6,600 books.
7) The number of books sold is the difference between the original 9,900 books and the 6,600 books left.
8) 9,900 - 6,600 = 3,300 books sold.

Answer: 3,300
