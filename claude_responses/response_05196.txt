Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark is currently reading books for 2 hours each day
* He wants to increase his time spent on reading books weekly by 4 hours
* To find the total time he wants to spend on reading books in one week, we need to:
  1. Calculate the current time he spends on reading books in one week:
     * 2 hours per day x 7 days in a week = 14 hours per week
  2. Add the 4 hours he wants to increase his weekly reading time by:
     * 14 hours + 4 hours = 18 hours

Answer: 18
