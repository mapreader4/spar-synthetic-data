Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The number of elephants at Gestures For Good park is 3 times as many as the number of elephants at We Preserve For Future park.
2) We are told that there are 70 elephants at We Preserve For Future park.
3) Since the number of elephants at Gestures For Good park is 3 times as many as the number at We Preserve For Future park, we can calculate the number of elephants at Gestures For Good park by multiplying 70 by 3.
4) 70 x 3 = 210 elephants at Gestures For Good park.
5) To get the total number of elephants in the two parks, we add the number of elephants at each park:
70 + 210 = 280 elephants.

Answer: 280
