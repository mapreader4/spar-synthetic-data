Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tobee scored 4 points.
2) Jay scored 6 more points than Tobee, so Jay scored 4 + 6 = 10 points.
3) Sean scored 2 less than the points of Tobee and Jay together, so Sean scored (4 + 10) - 2 = 12 points.
4) To find the total points scored by Tobee, Jay, and Sean, we add their individual scores:
Tobee: 4 points
Jay: 10 points
Sean: 12 points
Total points = 4 + 10 + 12 = 26 points.

Answer: 26
