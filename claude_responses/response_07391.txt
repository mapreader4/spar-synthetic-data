Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Samantha does 2 loads of laundry in the wash
* Each wash costs $4
* So the total cost for the wash is 2 x $4 = $8
* Samantha divides all the washed clothes equally into 3 separate dryers
* Each dryer runs for 40 minutes
* The cost for the dryer is a quarter for every 10 minutes
* So for each dryer, the cost is 4 x $0.25 = $1
* Since there are 3 dryers, the total cost for the dryers is 3 x $1 = $3
* Therefore, the total amount Samantha spends altogether is the cost of the wash ($8) plus the cost of the dryers ($3)
* Answer: $11
