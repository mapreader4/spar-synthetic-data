Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Smith has a balance of $150.
2) He has incurred a 2% finance charge because he was not able to pay on time.
3) To calculate the finance charge, we take the balance of $150 and multiply it by the finance charge of 2%:
   $150 x 0.02 = $3
4) So the finance charge is $3.
5) To settle the balance, Mr. Smith needs to pay the original balance of $150 plus the finance charge of $3.

Answer: $153
