Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mara has 40 crayons and 10% of them are pink.
   * To find the number of pink crayons Mara has, we take 10% of 40:
   * 10% of 40 = 0.10 * 40 = 4 pink crayons

2. Luna has 50 crayons and 20% of them are pink.
   * To find the number of pink crayons Luna has, we take 20% of 50:
   * 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 pink crayons

3. To find the total number of pink crayons Mara and Luna have, we add the number of pink crayons each of them has:
   * 4 (Mara) + 10 (Luna) = 14 pink crayons

Answer: 14
