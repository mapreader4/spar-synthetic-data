Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 2 small pizzas, and each pizza has 6 slices.
2) So the total number of slices is 2 pizzas x 6 slices per pizza = 12 slices.
3) James ate 2/3 of all the slices.
4) To calculate 2/3 of 12 slices, we multiply 12 by 2/3: 12 x 2/3 = 8 slices.

Answer: 8 slices of pizza.
