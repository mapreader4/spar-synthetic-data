Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Roxanne bought 2 cups of lemonade for $2 each, so the total cost of the lemonade is 2 x $2 = $4.
2) Roxanne also bought 2 sandwiches for $2.50 each, so the total cost of the sandwiches is 2 x $2.50 = $5.
3) The total cost of Roxanne's purchases is $4 (lemonade) + $5 (sandwiches) = $9.
4) Roxanne paid with a $20 bill, so the amount of change she must get back is $20 - $9 = $11.
