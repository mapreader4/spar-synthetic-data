Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Nicky spent 20 minutes waiting to take a number.
2) He then spent quadruple the amount of time waiting to take a number, plus an additional 14 minutes, waiting for his number to be called.
3) The time he spent waiting for his number to be called is:
   - Quadruple the time he spent waiting to take a number: 4 x 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Plus an additional 14 minutes
   - Total time waiting for his number to be called: 80 minutes + 14 minutes = 94 minutes
4) The total time Nicky spent waiting is the time he spent waiting to take a number (20 minutes) plus the time he spent waiting for his number to be called (94 minutes).
Answer: 114 minutes.
