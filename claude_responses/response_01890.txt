Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes
* Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes
* Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes

To find the total number of towels they can fold in one hour (60 minutes), we need to calculate the rate at which each person can fold towels.

Jane's rate:
* 3 towels in 5 minutes
* 3 towels / 5 minutes = 0.6 towels per minute

Kyla's rate:
* 5 towels in 10 minutes
* 5 towels / 10 minutes = 0.5 towels per minute

Anthony's rate:
* 7 towels in 20 minutes
* 7 towels / 20 minutes = 0.35 towels per minute

Now, we add up the rates to get the total rate at which they can fold towels together:
* 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.35 = 1.45 towels per minute

Finally, we multiply the total rate by the number of minutes in an hour to get the total number of towels they can fold in one hour:
* 1.45 towels per minute Ã— 60 minutes = 87 towels

Answer: 87
