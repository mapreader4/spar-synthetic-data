Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle.
2) The miniature poodle is 6 inches taller than the toy poodle.
3) We know the standard poodle is 28 inches tall.
4) Since the standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle, we can subtract 8 inches from 28 inches to get the height of the miniature poodle, which is 20 inches.
5) Since the miniature poodle is 6 inches taller than the toy poodle, we can subtract 6 inches from 20 inches to get the height of the toy poodle.

Answer: 14 inches
