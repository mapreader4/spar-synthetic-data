Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Robert originally had 25 balls
* Tim gave Robert half of his 40 balls
* To find how many balls Tim gave Robert, we take half of 40:
  * 40 / 2 = 20
* So, Tim gave Robert 20 balls
* Now, to find the total number of balls Robert has, we add the number of balls Tim gave him to the number of balls Robert originally had:
  * 25 + 20 = 45

Answer: 45
