Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Max needs 65 paper plates for the barbecue party.
2) He already has 22 green paper plates and 24 blue paper plates.
3) To find the total number of paper plates he already has, we add the green and blue plates:
22 green plates + 24 blue plates = 46 total plates
4) To find how many more paper plates he needs, we subtract the total number of plates he already has from the total he needs:
65 plates needed - 46 plates already owned = 19 more plates needed.

Answer: 19
