Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Darrel has the following coins:
   - 76 quarters
   - 85 dimes
   - 20 nickels
   - 150 pennies

2. To calculate the total value of his coins, we need to convert each type of coin to its dollar value:
   - 76 quarters x $0.25 = $19.00
   - 85 dimes x $0.10 = $8.50
   - 20 nickels x $0.05 = $1.00
   - 150 pennies x $0.01 = $1.50

3. Adding up the values of all the coins:
   - $19.00 + $8.50 + $1.00 + $1.50 = $30.00

4. Now, we need to calculate the 10% fee that will be charged:
   - 10% of $30.00 = $3.00

5. To find the amount Darrel will receive after the 10% fee, we subtract the fee from the total value of the coins:
   - $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Answer: $27
