Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gladys is 30 years old now.
2) Gladys' age is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas.
   * So, Gladys' age = 2 * (Billy's age + Lucas' age)
   * 30 = 2 * (Billy's age + Lucas' age)
3) Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys.
   * So, Billy's age = 30 / 3 = 10 years old
4) We want to find Lucas' age 3 years from now.
   * From step 2, we know that Lucas' age = (30 - 2 * 10) / 2 = 5 years old
   * 3 years from now, Lucas will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.
