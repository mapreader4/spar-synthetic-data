Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. There are 600 students in the senior class.
2. A fifth of the students are in the marching band. 
   * 600 / 5 = 120 students are in the marching band.
3. Half of the students in the marching band play a brass instrument.
   * 120 / 2 = 60 students play a brass instrument.
4. A fifth of the students that play a brass instrument play the saxophone.
   * 60 / 5 = 12 students play the saxophone.
5. A third of the students that play the saxophone play the alto saxophone.
   * 12 / 3 = 4 students play the alto saxophone.

Answer: 4 students play the alto saxophone.
