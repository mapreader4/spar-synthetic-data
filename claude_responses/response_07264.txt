Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The capacity of Karson's home library is 400 books.
2) He currently has 120 books.
3) To make his library 90% full, we need to calculate 90% of the total capacity.
4) 90% of 400 books is 0.9 * 400 = 360 books.
5) To make his library 90% full, he needs to have 360 books.
6) Since he currently has 120 books, he needs to buy 360 - 120 = 240 more books.

Answer: 240
