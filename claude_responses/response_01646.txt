Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that 198 passengers fit into 9 buses.
2) To find the number of passengers that fit in 5 buses, we need to find the number of passengers per bus.
3) To find the number of passengers per bus, we divide the total number of passengers (198) by the number of buses (9).
4) 198 / 9 = 22 passengers per bus.
5) Now that we know the number of passengers per bus, we can find the number of passengers that fit in 5 buses by multiplying the number of passengers per bus (22) by the number of buses (5).
6) 22 passengers per bus * 5 buses = 110 passengers.

Answer: 110
