Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Harry has 50 books in his library
* Flora has twice as many books as Harry
* So, Flora has 2 x 50 = 100 books
* Gary has half the books that Harry has
* So, Gary has 50 / 2 = 25 books
* To find the total number of books owned by the three of them, we add up the number of books each person has:
* Harry has 50 books
* Flora has 100 books
* Gary has 25 books
* Total number of books = 50 + 100 + 25 = 175 books

Answer: 175
