Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janet is driving a speedboat at 30 miles per hour
* Her sister is following in a sailboat at 12 miles per hour
* The lake is 60 miles wide

To find out how long Janet has to wait for her sister to catch up, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to cross the lake.

For Janet in the speedboat:
* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 60 miles / 30 miles per hour
* Time = 2 hours

For her sister in the sailboat:
* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 60 miles / 12 miles per hour
* Time = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the time Janet has to wait for her sister to catch up:
* Time Janet waits = Time for sister - Time for Janet
* Time Janet waits = 5 hours - 2 hours
* Time Janet waits = 3 hours

Answer: 3 hours
