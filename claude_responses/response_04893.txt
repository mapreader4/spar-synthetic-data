Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Camp Cedar has 40 boys.
2) It has 3 times as many girls as boys. So, the number of girls is 3 x 40 = 120.
3) The total number of children at Camp Cedar is 40 boys + 120 girls = 160 children.
4) The camp needs 1 counselor for every 8 children.
5) To calculate the number of counselors needed, we divide the total number of children by 8:
160 children / 8 children per counselor = 20 counselors.

Answer: 20
