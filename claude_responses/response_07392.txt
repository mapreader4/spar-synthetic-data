Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gina's sister watches a total of 24 shows per week on Netflix.
2) Gina chooses what they watch 3 times as often as her sister.
3) So, Gina chooses what they watch 3 x 24 = 72 times per week.
4) Each show is 50 minutes long.
5) Therefore, the total minutes of Netflix that Gina gets to choose is:
72 shows x 50 minutes per show = 3,600 minutes.

Answer: 3,600
