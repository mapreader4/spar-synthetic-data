Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Fred is inviting 15 people to the party.
2) Each guest will drink 2 sodas.
3) So the total number of sodas needed is 15 guests x 2 sodas per guest = 30 sodas.
4) The store is selling 6-packs of canned sodas for $3.00 each.
5) To calculate the number of 6-packs needed, we divide the total number of sodas (30) by the number of sodas in each 6-pack (6):
30 sodas / 6 sodas per 6-pack = 5 6-packs.
6) The cost of 5 6-packs at $3.00 each is:
5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

Answer: $15.00
