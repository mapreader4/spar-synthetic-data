Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill
* Let's call Bill's experience 5 years ago as x
* Then, Joan's experience 5 years ago was 3x
* Now, Joan has twice as much experience as Bill
* Let's call Bill's experience now as y
* Then, Joan's experience now is 2y
* We know that 5 years ago, Joan had 3x experience, and now she has 2y experience
* So, 2y = 3x + 5 (since 5 years have passed)
* Rearranging, we get y = (3x + 5)/2
* We also know that Bill's experience has increased by 5 years, so y = x + 5
* Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
* (3x + 5)/2 = x + 5
* Solving for x, we get:
* 3x + 5 = 2x + 10
* x = 5
* Therefore, Bill's experience now is y = x + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 years
