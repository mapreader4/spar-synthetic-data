Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) George donated half his monthly income to charity.
2) The remaining half of his income, he spent $20 on groceries.
3) After the donation and grocery expenses, he has $100 left.

Let's call George's monthly income "x".
* He donated half of x, which is x/2.
* The remaining half, x/2, he spent $20 from.
* So, he has (x/2) - $20 left.

We know that the final amount he has left is $100, so we can set up an equation:
(x/2) - $20 = $100

Solving for x:
x/2 = $120
x = $240

Therefore, George's monthly income was $240.

Answer: 240
