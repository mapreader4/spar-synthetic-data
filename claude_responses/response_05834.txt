Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The parking lot in front of the school has 52 parking spaces.
2) The parking lot in the back of the school has 38 parking spaces.
3) 39 cars have parked in the school.
4) 1/2 of the spaces in the back parking lot are filled.
5) To find the number of filled spaces in the back parking lot, we take 1/2 of 38, which is 19.
6) The total number of filled spaces is 39 (from the front lot) + 19 (from the back lot) = 58.
7) The total number of parking spaces in the school is 52 (front lot) + 38 (back lot) = 90.
8) To find the number of available parking spaces, we take the total number of spaces (90) and subtract the number of filled spaces (58).
