Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carol sold tickets worth $960 over three days
* Each ticket costs $4
* To find the average number of tickets sold per day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of tickets sold over the three days
2. Divide the total number of tickets by 3 to get the average per day

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets sold
* Total tickets sold = Total sales / Cost per ticket
* Total tickets sold = $960 / $4 = 240 tickets

Step 2: Calculate the average number of tickets sold per day
* Average tickets per day = Total tickets sold / Number of days
* Average tickets per day = 240 tickets / 3 days = 80 tickets

Answer: 80 tickets
