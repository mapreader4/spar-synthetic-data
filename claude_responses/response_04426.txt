Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2.
2) The shortest piece is 16 cm.
3) To find the length of the entire wire before it was cut, we need to find the total of the three pieces.
4) The ratio of the three pieces is 7:3:2, so the lengths of the three pieces are in the same ratio.
5) The shortest piece is 16 cm, so the length of the second piece is 16 * (3/2) = 24 cm.
6) The length of the third piece is 16 * (7/2) = 56 cm.
7) The total length of the wire before it was cut is the sum of the three pieces: 16 + 24 + 56 = 96 cm.

Answer: 96
