Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Ferris wheel:
   - 3 children rode the Ferris wheel
   - Cost per child: $5
   - Total cost for Ferris wheel: 3 × $5 = $15

2. Merry-go-round:
   - All 5 children rode the merry-go-round
   - Cost per child: $3
   - Total cost for merry-go-round: 5 × $3 = $15

3. Ice cream:
   - Each child bought 2 cones of ice cream
   - Cost per cone: $8
   - Total cost for ice cream: 5 × 2 × $8 = $80

4. Total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of Ferris wheel + Cost of merry-go-round + Cost of ice cream
   - Total cost = $15 + $15 + $80 = $110

Answer: 110
