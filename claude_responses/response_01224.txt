Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jim starts with $80 in his investment portfolio.
2. After 1 year, the portfolio grows by 15%. 
   * 15% of $80 is $12 (0.15 x $80 = $12)
   * So the new portfolio value is $80 + $12 = $92

3. Jim then adds another $28 to his portfolio.
   * The new portfolio value is $92 + $28 = $120

4. After 1 more year, the combined portfolio grows by 10%.
   * 10% of $120 is $12 (0.10 x $120 = $12)
   * So the final portfolio value is $120 + $12 = $132

Answer: $132
