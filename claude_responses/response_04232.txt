Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Beyonce released 5 different singles on iTunes.
2) She then released 2 albums, each with 15 songs. That's 2 x 15 = 30 songs.
3) She also released 1 album with 20 songs.
4) To calculate the total number of songs released, we add up the singles and the songs from the albums:
5 singles + 30 songs from the 2 albums + 20 songs from the 1 album = 5 + 30 + 20 = 55 songs.

Answer: 55
