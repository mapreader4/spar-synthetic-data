Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kohen orders 10 boxes of apples per week.
2) Each box has 300 apples.
3) So the total number of apples Kohen orders per week is:
10 boxes x 300 apples per box = 3,000 apples
4) Kohen sells 3/4 of his stock in a certain week.
5) This means that 1/4 of the stock is not sold.
6) The total number of apples not sold is 1/4 of the 3,000 apples ordered that week.
7) 1/4 of 3,000 apples = 3,000 * 1/4 = 750 apples.

Answer: 750 apples
