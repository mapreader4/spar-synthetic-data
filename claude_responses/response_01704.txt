Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Grandma put 3 mushrooms on her salad
* She added twice as many cherry tomatoes as mushrooms, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 cherry tomatoes
* She added 4 times as many pickles as cherry tomatoes, so that's 4 x 6 = 24 pickles
* She added 4 times as many bacon bits as pickles, so that's 4 x 24 = 96 bacon bits
* One third of the bacon bits were red, so that's 1/3 of 96 = 32 red bacon bits

Answer: 32
