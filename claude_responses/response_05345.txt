Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lee earns $60,000 per year in salary
* He can save $1,000 per month
* The adage states that he should spend two months' salary on the ring
* To calculate two months' salary, we take his annual salary of $60,000 and divide it by 12 months to get his monthly salary of $5,000. Then we multiply $5,000 by 2 to get $10,000 as the recommended amount to spend on the ring.

Now, to determine how long it will take Lee to save up $10,000 for the ring:
* He can save $1,000 per month
* So it will take him 10 months to save up the $10,000 needed for the ring
