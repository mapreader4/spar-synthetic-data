Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Greg's wheels rotate 200 times per block
* He wants to ride at least 8 blocks
* His wheels have already rotated 600 times

To find how many more times the wheels need to rotate to reach his goal, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of wheel rotations needed for 8 blocks
2. Subtract the number of rotations already completed (600) from the total needed

Step 1: Total number of wheel rotations needed for 8 blocks
* 8 blocks x 200 rotations per block = 1600 rotations

Step 2: Subtract the number of rotations already completed
* 1600 rotations - 600 rotations = 1000 rotations

Therefore, the wheels need to rotate 1000 more times to reach Greg's goal.

Answer: 1000
