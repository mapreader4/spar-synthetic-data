Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Amelia has $60 to spend on her dinner.
2) The first course costs $15.
3) The second course costs $5 more than the first course, so it costs $15 + $5 = $20.
4) The cost of the dessert is 25% of the price of the second course, which is $20. 25% of $20 is 0.25 * $20 = $5.
5) The total cost of the dinner is the first course ($15) + the second course ($20) + the dessert ($5) = $15 + $20 + $5 = $40.
6) Amelia had $60 to spend, and she spent $40, so the amount of money she has left is $60 - $40 = $20.

Answer: $20
