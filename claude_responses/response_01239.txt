Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The cost to remove the old floor is $50.
2. The size of the room is 8 feet by 7 feet.
3. To calculate the area of the room, we multiply the length and width:
   * Area = 8 feet x 7 feet = 56 square feet
4. The new floor costs $1.25 per square foot.
5. To calculate the cost of the new floor, we multiply the area by the cost per square foot:
   * Cost of new floor = 56 square feet x $1.25 per square foot = $70

Now, to find the total cost to replace the floor, we add the cost to remove the old floor and the cost of the new floor:
* Total cost = $50 (remove old floor) + $70 (new floor) = $120

Answer: $120
