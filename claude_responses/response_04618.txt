Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dexter filled 3 fewer plastic boxes with football cards than basketball cards
* He filled 9 boxes with basketball cards
* Each box has 15 basketball cards
* For the boxes with football cards, each box has 20 cards

First, we need to find out how many boxes of football cards Dexter filled:
* If he filled 3 fewer boxes of football cards than basketball cards, and he filled 9 boxes of basketball cards, then he filled 9 - 3 = 6 boxes of football cards.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cards:
* Basketball cards: 9 boxes x 15 cards per box = 135 cards
* Football cards: 6 boxes x 20 cards per box = 120 cards
* Total cards: 135 + 120 = 255 cards

Answer: 255
