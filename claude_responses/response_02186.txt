Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jeff was driving at 80 miles/hour for 6 hours.
   * Distance traveled at 80 miles/hour for 6 hours = 80 miles/hour * 6 hours = 480 miles
2) Then he drove at 60 miles/hour for 4 hours.
   * Distance traveled at 60 miles/hour for 4 hours = 60 miles/hour * 4 hours = 240 miles
3) Finally, he drove at 40 miles/hour for 2 hours.
   * Distance traveled at 40 miles/hour for 2 hours = 40 miles/hour * 2 hours = 80 miles
4) Adding up the distances:
   * Total distance = 480 miles + 240 miles + 80 miles = 800 miles

Answer: 800 miles
