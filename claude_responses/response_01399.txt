Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The highest wave Austin caught was two feet higher than four times his height.
2) The shortest wave he caught was four feet higher than his height.
3) The shortest wave was three feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard.

Let's start with the shortest wave:
* The shortest wave was 3 feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard.
* Therefore, the shortest wave was 7 + 3 = 10 feet high.

Now, the shortest wave was 4 feet higher than his height.
* So, his height must be 10 - 4 = 6 feet.

Finally, the highest wave was 2 feet higher than four times his height.
* His height is 6 feet, so four times his height is 4 * 6 = 24 feet.
* The highest wave was 2 feet higher than 24 feet.
* Therefore, the highest wave Austin caught was 24 + 2 = 26 feet.

Answer: 26
