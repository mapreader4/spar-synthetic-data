Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack has $43 in his piggy bank to start with.
* He gets an allowance of $10 a week.
* He puts half of his allowance into his piggy bank every week.
* We want to know how much he will have in his piggy bank after 8 weeks.

First, let's calculate how much he will save each week:
* Jack's weekly allowance is $10.
* He puts half of that, which is $5, into his piggy bank each week.

Now, let's calculate how much he will have saved after 8 weeks:
* $5 per week x 8 weeks = $40 saved.
* He started with $43 in his piggy bank.
* So after 8 weeks, he will have $43 + $40 = $83 in his piggy bank.

Answer: 83
