Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 types of pencils:
  - Pencil with eraser: $0.8 each
  - Regular pencil: $0.5 each
  - Short pencil: $0.4 each
* The store sold:
  - 200 pencils with eraser
  - 40 regular pencils
  - 35 short pencils
* To calculate the total revenue:
  - Revenue from pencils with eraser: 200 * $0.8 = $160
  - Revenue from regular pencils: 40 * $0.5 = $20
  - Revenue from short pencils: 35 * $0.4 = $14
* Adding up the revenue from all 3 types of pencils:
  - Total revenue = $160 + $20 + $14 = $194

Answer: $194
