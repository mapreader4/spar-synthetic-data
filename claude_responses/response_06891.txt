Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ben caught 4 fish
* Judy caught 1 fish
* Billy caught 3 fish
* Jim caught 2 fish
* Susie caught 5 fish
* So the total number of fish caught is 4 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 15 fish
* However, they threw back 3 fish that were too small
* So the total number of fish they kept is 15 - 3 = 12 fish
* Each fish will give them 2 filets
* Therefore, the total number of fish filets they will have is 12 fish x 2 filets per fish = 24 filets
