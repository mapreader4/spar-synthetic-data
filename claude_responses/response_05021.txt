Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Jesse received $50 as a gift
* She bought a novel that cost $7
* She then went to lunch and spent twice as much as the novel cost, which means she spent $14 on lunch

Now, let's calculate how much money Jesse had left after going to the mall:
* Jesse started with $50
* She spent $7 on the novel
* She spent $14 on lunch
* So the total amount she spent is $7 + $14 = $21
* To find the amount of money she had left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original $50:
* $50 - $21 = $29

Answer: $29
