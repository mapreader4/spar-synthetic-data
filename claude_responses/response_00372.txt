Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The race distance is 10K (10 kilometers)
* TJ ran the first half in 20 minutes
* TJ ran the second half in 30 minutes
* To calculate the total time, we add the times for the two halves:
    - 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes
* To calculate the average time per kilometer, we divide the total time by the total distance:
    - 50 minutes / 10 kilometers = 5 minutes per kilometer
