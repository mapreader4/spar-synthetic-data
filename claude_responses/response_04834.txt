Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long.
2) The rungs are 6 inches apart.
3) James needs to climb 50 feet.
4) To convert 50 feet to inches, we multiply 50 by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).
5) 50 feet x 12 inches/foot = 600 inches.
6) Since the rungs are 6 inches apart, we can divide the total height of 600 inches by 6 inches to determine the number of rungs needed.
7) 600 inches / 6 inches per rung = 100 rungs.
8) Each rung is 18 inches long, so the total length of wood needed is:
100 rungs x 18 inches per rung = 1,800 inches.
9) To convert this to feet, we divide 1,800 inches by 12 inches per foot.
10) 1,800 inches / 12 inches per foot = 150 feet.

Answer: 150 feet.
