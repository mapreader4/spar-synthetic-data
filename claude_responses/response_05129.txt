Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Karlee has 100 grapes
2) She has 3/5 as many strawberries as grapes
* To calculate the number of strawberries, we take 3/5 of 100 grapes
* 3/5 of 100 = 60 strawberries
3) Karlee gives 1/5 of each fruit to each of her two friends, Giana and Ansley
* 1/5 of 100 grapes = 20 grapes per friend
* 1/5 of 60 strawberries = 12 strawberries per friend
4) So in total, Karlee gave away:
* 20 grapes x 2 friends = 40 grapes
* 12 strawberries x 2 friends = 24 strawberries
5) To calculate the total number of fruits Karlee has left:
* Grapes left = 100 - 40 = 60 grapes
* Strawberries left = 60 - 24 = 36 strawberries
6) The total number of fruits Karlee has left is:
* 60 grapes + 36 strawberries = 96 fruits

Answer: 96
