Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Facebook's annual earnings for 2020 were $5,000,000.
2) The productivity bonus will total 25% of this, which is 0.25 * $5,000,000 = $1,250,000.
3) Facebook employs 3300 employees, and one-third of them are men. So the number of women employees is 2/3 * 3300 = 2200.
4) Of the 2200 women employees, 1200 are not mothers. So the number of female mother employees is 2200 - 1200 = 1000.
5) The $1,250,000 bonus is to be divided equally among the 1000 female mother employees.
6) Therefore, the bonus that each female mother employee received is $1,250,000 / 1000 = $1,250.

Answer: $1,250
