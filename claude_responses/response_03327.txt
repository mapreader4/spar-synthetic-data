Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tom spent $250 to buy gems.
2) The game gives 100 gems for each dollar spent.
3) So, for $250, Tom would have received 100 * $250 = 25,000 gems.
4) However, since Tom bought so many gems, he received a 20% bonus of more gems.
5) The 20% bonus would be 20% of 25,000 gems, which is 0.2 * 25,000 = 5,000 gems.
6) Therefore, the total number of gems Tom received is 25,000 + 5,000 = 30,000 gems.

Answer: 30,000
