Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday night, Harry sleeps for 8 hours.
* On Tuesday night, Harry sleeps for 7 hours.
* On Wednesday night, Harry sleeps for 8 hours.
* On Thursday night, Harry sleeps for 10 hours.
* On Friday night, Harry sleeps for 7 hours.

To calculate the average number of hours Harry sleeps in one night, we need to add up the total number of hours he sleeps over the 5 nights and then divide by 5.

The total number of hours Harry sleeps is:
8 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 7 = 40 hours

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of nights:
40 hours / 5 nights = 8 hours

Answer: 8
