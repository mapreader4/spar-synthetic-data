Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jameson has a total of 20 medals.
2) 5 of the medals are for track.
3) He has two times as many swimming medals as track medals.
   * Since he has 5 track medals, he has 2 x 5 = 10 swimming medals.
4) The remaining medals must be for badminton.
   * Total medals = 20
   * Track medals = 5
   * Swimming medals = 10
   * Badminton medals = 20 - 5 - 10 = 5

Answer: 5
