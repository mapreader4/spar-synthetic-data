Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* During the first hour, Joanne collected 15 coins.
* During the next two hours, she collected 35 coins.
* So, in the first 3 hours, she collected a total of 15 + 35 = 50 coins.
* In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins.
* However, she gave 15 of those coins to her coworker.
* So, the number of coins she had after the fourth hour is:
* Total coins collected in the first 3 hours: 50
* Coins collected in the fourth hour: 50
* Coins given to her coworker: 15
* Therefore, the total number of coins she had after the fourth hour is:
* 50 + 50 - 15 = 85 coins.

Answer: 85
