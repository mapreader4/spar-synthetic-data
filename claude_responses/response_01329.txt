Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 people running for president
* John manages to capture 150 votes
* James captures 70% of the remaining vote
* There were 1150 people voting in total

First, let's calculate the remaining votes after John's 150 votes:
* Total votes = 1150
* John's votes = 150
* Remaining votes = 1150 - 150 = 1000

Now, James captures 70% of the remaining 1000 votes:
* James' votes = 70% of 1000 = 0.7 * 1000 = 700

Finally, we can calculate the number of votes the third candidate received:
* Total votes = 1150
* John's votes = 150
* James' votes = 700
* Third candidate's votes = 1150 - 150 - 700 = 300

The question asks how many more votes the third candidate got than John. To calculate this, we subtract John's votes from the third candidate's votes:
* Third candidate's votes - John's votes = 300 - 150 = 150

Answer: 150
