Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Martha's cat catches 3 rats and 7 birds, so the total number of animals caught by Martha's cat is 3 + 7 = 10 animals.
2) Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times as many animals as Martha's cat.
3) Five times the number of animals caught by Martha's cat is 5 * 10 = 50 animals.
4) Cara's cat catches 3 less than 50 animals, so the number of animals caught by Cara's cat is 50 - 3 = 47 animals.

Answer: 47
