Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The brownie costs $2.50
* Juanita ordered 2 scoops of ice cream, which is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
* Juanita ordered double syrup, which is 2 x $0.50 = $1.00
* Juanita ordered nuts, which is $1.50

To calculate the total cost, we add up all the individual costs:
* Brownie: $2.50
* Ice cream: $2.00
* Syrup: $1.00
* Nuts: $1.50

Adding these together, the total cost of Juanita's dessert is:
* $2.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.50 = $7.00

Answer: $7.00
