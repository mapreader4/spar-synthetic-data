Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

In the morning:
* Mike planted 50 tomato seeds
* Ted planted twice as much as Mike, which is 2 x 50 = 100 tomato seeds

In the afternoon:
* Mike planted 60 tomato seeds
* Ted planted 20 fewer tomato seeds than Mike, which is 60 - 20 = 40 tomato seeds

Now, we can add up the total number of tomato seeds planted:
* Mike planted 50 + 60 = 110 tomato seeds
* Ted planted 100 + 40 = 140 tomato seeds
* Total tomato seeds planted = 110 + 140 = 250 tomato seeds

Answer: 250
