Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The necklace stand can hold 12 necklaces, and it currently holds 5 necklaces. So, the store needs to restock 12 - 5 = 7 necklaces.
2) The ring display can hold 30 rings, and it currently holds 18 rings. So, the store needs to restock 30 - 18 = 12 rings.
3) The bracelet display can hold 15 bracelets, and it currently holds 8 bracelets. So, the store needs to restock 15 - 8 = 7 bracelets.
4) The supplier charges $4 per necklace, $10 per ring, and $5 per bracelet.
5) To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of items needed by the cost per item and then add them all together.
6) For the necklaces, the cost is 7 * $4 = $28.
7) For the rings, the cost is 12 * $10 = $120.
8) For the bracelets, the cost is 7 * $5 = $35.
9) The total cost is $28 + $120 + $35 = $183.

Answer: $183
