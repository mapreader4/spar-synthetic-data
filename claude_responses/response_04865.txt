Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The initial population of the city is 300,000 people.
2) 50,000 people immigrate to the country, so the new population is 300,000 + 50,000 = 350,000 people.
3) 30,000 people leave the city, so the new population is 350,000 - 30,000 = 320,000 people.
4) 1/8 of the population gets pregnant, which is 1/8 of 320,000 = 40,000 people.
5) 1/4 of the 40,000 pregnant people have twins, which is 1/4 of 40,000 = 10,000 people.
6) Therefore, the total number of people after the births is 320,000 + 10,000 = 330,000 people.

Answer: 330,000
