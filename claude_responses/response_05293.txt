Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Katie needs 3 pounds of flour for her bread
* Sheila needs 2 more pounds of flour than Katie for her bread
* To calculate Sheila's flour requirement, we add 2 pounds to Katie's 3 pounds
* 3 pounds + 2 pounds = 5 pounds of flour for Sheila's bread

Now, to find the total amount of flour needed for both breads, we add Katie's and Sheila's flour requirements:
* Katie's flour: 3 pounds
* Sheila's flour: 5 pounds
* Total flour needed: 3 pounds + 5 pounds = 8 pounds

Answer: 8 pounds
