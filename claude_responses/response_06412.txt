Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Diane bakes 4 trays with 25 gingerbreads in each tray.
2) So for the 4 trays with 25 gingerbreads each, the total number of gingerbreads is:
4 trays x 25 gingerbreads per tray = 100 gingerbreads
3) Diane also bakes 3 trays with 20 gingerbreads in each tray.
4) So for the 3 trays with 20 gingerbreads each, the total number of gingerbreads is:
3 trays x 20 gingerbreads per tray = 60 gingerbreads
5) To get the total number of gingerbreads Diane baked, we add the two amounts together:
100 gingerbreads + 60 gingerbreads = 160 gingerbreads

Answer: 160
