Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The rectangular prism is 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base.
2) The volume of the rectangular prism is the base area multiplied by the height.
3) The base area is 2 meters x 2 meters = 4 square meters.
4) The volume of the rectangular prism is 4 square meters x 8 meters = 32 cubic meters.
5) The density of the marble is 2700 kg per cubic meter.
6) To find the weight, we multiply the volume by the density:
32 cubic meters x 2700 kg/cubic meter = 86,400 kg.

Answer: 86,400
