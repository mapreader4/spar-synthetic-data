Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alfonso earns $6 each day walking his aunt's dog
* He is saving to buy a mountain bike helmet for $340
* He already has $40 saved
* He walks the dog 5 days a week

First, we need to calculate how much he earns in a week:
* 5 days a week x $6 per day = $30 per week

Next, we need to calculate how much more he needs to save to buy the helmet:
* $340 (cost of helmet) - $40 (already saved) = $300 more needed

Finally, we can calculate how many weeks it will take him to save the remaining $300:
* $300 / $30 per week = 10 weeks

Therefore, it will take Alfonso 10 weeks to save enough money to buy the mountain bike helmet.
