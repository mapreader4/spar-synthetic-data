Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Rick has 400 books in total.
2) He wants to divide them into groups of 25 (24 other books plus the one book).
3) To do this, he needs to repeatedly divide the groups in half until each group has 25 books.
4) Let's start with the initial 400 books. Dividing 400 by 2 gives us 200 books in each group.
5) Dividing 200 by 2 gives us 100 books in each group.
6) Dividing 100 by 2 gives us 50 books in each group.
7) Dividing 50 by 2 gives us 25 books in each group.
8) So Rick must divide the groups 4 times to get each group down to 25 books.
