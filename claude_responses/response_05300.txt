Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Javier plays 2 baseball games a week
* In his first 20 games, he averaged 2 hits per game
* He has 10 games left in the season
* We want to find the average number of hits per game he needs to bring his season average up to 3 hits per game

First, let's calculate the total number of hits he had in the first 20 games:
* 20 games x 2 hits per game = 40 hits

Now, let's calculate the total number of hits he needs to have for the entire season to average 3 hits per game:
* 30 games (20 + 10) x 3 hits per game = 90 hits

To find the number of hits he needs in the remaining 10 games, we subtract the 40 hits he already has from the 90 hits he needs for the season:
* 90 hits - 40 hits = 50 hits

Finally, to find the average number of hits per game he needs in the remaining 10 games, we divide the 50 hits by the 10 games:
* 50 hits / 10 games = 5 hits per game

Answer: 5
