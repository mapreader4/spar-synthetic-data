Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Fabian has 3 times more marbles than Kyle.
2) Fabian has 5 times more marbles than Miles.
3) Fabian has 15 marbles.
4) Since Fabian has 3 times more marbles than Kyle, that means Kyle has 15 / 3 = 5 marbles.
5) Since Fabian has 5 times more marbles than Miles, that means Miles has 15 / 5 = 3 marbles.
6) The total number of marbles that Kyle and Miles have together is 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
