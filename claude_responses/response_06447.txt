Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Apples are being sold for $2 each at the fruit stand.
2) Emmy has $200 to spend on apples.
3) Gerry has $100 to spend on apples.
4) To find the total number of apples they can buy, we need to add up the amount of money they have and divide it by the cost of each apple.
5) Emmy has $200, so she can buy 200 / 2 = 100 apples.
6) Gerry has $100, so he can buy 100 / 2 = 50 apples.
7) In total, Emmy and Gerry can buy 100 + 50 = 150 apples.

Answer: 150
