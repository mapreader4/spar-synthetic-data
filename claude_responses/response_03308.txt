Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason worked for 9 years as a bartender
* 9 years = 9 x 12 months = 108 months as a bartender
* Jason then worked for 3 years and 6 months as a manager
* 3 years = 3 x 12 months = 36 months
* 6 months = 6 months
* Total months as a manager = 36 + 6 = 42 months
* Now, we add the total months as a bartender and the total months as a manager:
* 108 months + 42 months = 150 months

Answer: 150
