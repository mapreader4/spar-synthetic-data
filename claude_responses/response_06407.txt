Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The box contains 50 chocolates in total
* 3 of them are caramels
* Twice as many are nougats, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 nougats
* The number of truffles is equal to the number of caramels plus 6, so that's 3 + 6 = 9 truffles
* The remaining chocolates are peanut clusters

Now, let's calculate the number of peanut clusters:
* Total chocolates = 50
* Caramels = 3
* Nougats = 6
* Truffles = 9
* Peanut clusters = 50 - 3 - 6 - 9 = 32

To calculate the percentage chance of picking a peanut cluster, we divide the number of peanut clusters by the total number of chocolates and multiply by 100:
* Percentage chance = (32 / 50) x 100 = 64%

Answer: 64
