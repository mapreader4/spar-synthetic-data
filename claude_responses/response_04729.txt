Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The Lamplighter monkey can swing at a speed of 10 feet per second
* When frightened, the monkey can run at a speed of 15 feet per second
* The monkey runs for 5 seconds to evade the predator
* Then, the monkey swings for another 10 seconds to add distance

To calculate the total distance traveled:
1) Distance traveled while running:
   * Speed while running: 15 feet per second
   * Time spent running: 5 seconds
   * Distance traveled while running = 15 feet per second x 5 seconds = 75 feet
2) Distance traveled while swinging:
   * Speed while swinging: 10 feet per second
   * Time spent swinging: 10 seconds
   * Distance traveled while swinging = 10 feet per second x 10 seconds = 100 feet
3) Total distance traveled:
   * Distance traveled while running + distance traveled while swinging
   * 75 feet + 100 feet = 175 feet

Answer: 175 feet
