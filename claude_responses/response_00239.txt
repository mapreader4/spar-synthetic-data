Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Frank has:
  - 7 one-dollar bills
  - 4 five-dollar bills
  - 2 ten-dollar bills
  - 1 twenty-dollar bill
* So the total amount of money Frank has is:
  - 7 x $1 = $7
  - 4 x $5 = $20
  - 2 x $10 = $20
  - 1 x $20 = $20
* Total amount of money Frank has = $7 + $20 + $20 + $20 = $67
* He spent $63 on peanuts and has $4 in change
* The peanuts cost $3 per pound
* So the total amount of peanuts he bought is $63 / $3 = 21 pounds
* He plans to eat the peanuts all in one week
* Therefore, the average amount of peanuts he eats per day is 21 pounds / 7 days = 3 pounds per day

Answer: 3 pounds
