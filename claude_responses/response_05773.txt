Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Ravenswood forest has four times as many gnomes as the Westerville woods.
2) There are 20 gnomes in the Westerville woods.
3) Therefore, the Ravenswood forest has 4 x 20 = 80 gnomes.
4) The forest owner takes 40% of the gnomes from the Ravenswood forest.
5) 40% of 80 gnomes is 0.4 x 80 = 32 gnomes.
6) Therefore, the number of gnomes remaining in the Ravenswood forest is 80 - 32 = 48 gnomes.

Answer: 48
