Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anie needs 5 extra hours aside from her normal 10-hour work schedule each day to finish the task.
* So, her total productive hours per day is 10 hours + 5 extra hours = 15 hours.
* The project is estimated to take 1500 hours.
* To find the number of days it would take Anie to finish the job, we need to divide the total hours required (1500) by the number of productive hours per day (15).
* 1500 hours / 15 hours per day = 100 days.

Answer: 100 days.
