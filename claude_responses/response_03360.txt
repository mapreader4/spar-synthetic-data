Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there are 5 different types of animals at the zoo
* Each animal type takes around 6 minutes to see
* The zoo decides to import 4 new species
* So, the total number of animal types at the zoo will be 5 + 4 = 9 different types
* To see each animal type, it will take 9 * 6 minutes = 54 minutes
