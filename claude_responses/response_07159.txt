Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jalen weighs 160 pounds
* Ponce is 10 pounds lighter than Jalen
* So, Ponce's weight is 160 - 10 = 150 pounds
* Ishmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce
* So, Ishmael's weight is 150 + 20 = 170 pounds

Now, to calculate the average weight of the three:
* Average weight = (Ishmael's weight + Ponce's weight + Jalen's weight) / 3
* Average weight = (170 + 150 + 160) / 3
* Average weight = 480 / 3
* Average weight = 160 pounds

Answer: 160
