Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Harry has already been on the bus for 15 minutes.
2) The remaining bus journey will take another 25 minutes.
3) The total bus journey time is 15 minutes + 25 minutes = 40 minutes.
4) The walk from the bus stop to his house will take half the amount of time the bus journey took, which is 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.
5) The total time Harry will have spent traveling is the bus journey time (40 minutes) plus the walk time (20 minutes), which is 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

Answer: 60 minutes
