Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Brenda weighs 10 pounds more than 3 times Mel's weight
* This means that Brenda's weight = 3 * Mel's weight + 10
* We are given that Brenda weighs 220 pounds
* So we can set up the equation:
* 220 = 3 * Mel's weight + 10
* Solving for Mel's weight:
* 220 - 10 = 3 * Mel's weight
* 210 = 3 * Mel's weight
* Mel's weight = 210 / 3
* Mel's weight = 70 pounds

Answer: 70
