Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Layla scored 104 goals in four hockey games
* Kristin scored 24 fewer goals than Layla in the same four games
* To calculate Kristin's goals, we subtract 24 from Layla's 104 goals:
    * Kristin's goals = 104 - 24 = 80 goals
* To calculate the average number of goals the two scored, we add Layla's and Kristin's goals, then divide by 2:
    * Total goals = Layla's goals + Kristin's goals = 104 + 80 = 184 goals
    * Average goals = Total goals / 2 = 184 / 2 = 92 goals

Answer: 92
