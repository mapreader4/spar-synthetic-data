Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lena has 7 closest friends
* She has 3 newspaper clippings for each friend's picture
* It takes 6 drops of glue to stick down each clipping

First, we need to calculate the total number of newspaper clippings:
* 7 friends x 3 clippings per friend = 21 clippings

Now, we need to calculate the total number of drops of glue needed for the 21 clippings:
* 21 clippings x 6 drops of glue per clipping = 126 drops of glue

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 126
