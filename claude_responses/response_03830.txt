Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The psychologist believes that 1 in every 4 people has the ZYX syndrome.
2) The clinic has recently doubled its previous number of 26 patients.
3) To find the new number of patients, we double the previous number of 26 patients:
   * 26 x 2 = 52 patients
4) Now, to find the number of patients likely to be diagnosed with ZYX syndrome, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of patients:
   * 52 patients x 1/4 = 13 patients

Answer: 13
