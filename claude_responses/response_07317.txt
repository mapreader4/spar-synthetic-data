Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark has to wait 4 days for his first coronavirus vaccine appointment
* Then he has to wait 20 days for his second vaccine appointment
* Then he has to wait 2 weeks (14 days) for the vaccine to be fully effective

To calculate the total number of days Mark has to wait, we add up these three time periods:
* 4 days + 20 days + 14 days = 38 days

Answer: 38
