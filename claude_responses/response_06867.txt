Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jack needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer shoes.
2) Each pair of socks costs $9.50.
3) The shoes cost $92.
4) To calculate the total cost of the socks, we multiply the cost per pair ($9.50) by the number of pairs (2):
   2 x $9.50 = $19
5) The total cost of the socks and shoes is:
   $19 + $92 = $111
6) Jack has $40.
7) To calculate how much more money Jack needs, we subtract the amount he has ($40) from the total cost ($111):
   $111 - $40 = $71

Answer: $71
