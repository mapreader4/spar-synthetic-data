Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The regular price of the ticket is $15.
2) Maria was able to get a 40% discount on the ticket.
3) To calculate the discounted price, we need to find 40% of $15:
   * 40% of $15 = 0.4 * $15 = $6
4) Now, we subtract the discount ($6) from the regular price ($15) to get the discounted price:
   * $15 - $6 = $9
Therefore, the amount Maria paid for the ticket is:
Answer: $9
