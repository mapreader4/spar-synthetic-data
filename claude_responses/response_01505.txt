Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary initially had 6 lambs
* 2 of the lambs had 2 babies each, so that's 4 additional lambs
* So now Mary has 6 + 4 = 10 lambs
* She then traded 3 lambs for one goat, so she now has 10 - 3 = 7 lambs
* Finally, she found an extra 7 lambs in the field
* So the total number of lambs Mary has is 7 + 7 = 14

Answer: 14
