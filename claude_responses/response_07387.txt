Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Amanda makes $50.00 per hour
* She works for 10 hours a day
* So her daily pay is $50.00 x 10 hours = $500.00
* If she does not finish the sales report by midnight, Jose will withhold 20% of her pay
* To calculate the amount withheld, we take 20% of $500.00, which is $100.00
* Therefore, the amount of money Amanda will receive if she does not finish the sales report by midnight is $500.00 - $100.00 = $400.00

Answer: $400
