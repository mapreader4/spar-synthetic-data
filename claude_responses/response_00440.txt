Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Cori is 3 years old today.
2) In 5 years, Cori will be 3 + 5 = 8 years old.
3) In 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt.
4) Let's call the aunt's age today 'x'.
5) In 5 years, the aunt's age will be x + 5.
6) We know that Cori's age in 5 years (8) will be one-third of the aunt's age in 5 years (x + 5).
7) So we can write the equation: 8 = (x + 5) / 3
8) Solving for x, we get: x = 19.

Answer: 19.
