Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Alma has 47 baby carrots to feed the 4 goats.
2) She wants to give the exact same amount of carrots to each goat.
3) To find the number of carrots each goat will get, we divide the total number of carrots (47) by the number of goats (4):
47 รท 4 = 11 carrots per goat.
4) Since Alma wants to feed them all the carrots she can, there will be some leftover carrots.
5) To find the number of leftover carrots, we take the total number of carrots (47) and subtract the number of carrots given to each goat (4 x 11 = 44):
47 - 44 = 3 carrots left over.
