Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Amanda's garden has 20 flowers.
2) Peter's garden has three times as many flowers as Amanda's, which means Peter's garden has 3 x 20 = 60 flowers.
3) Peter gave 15 flowers to his brother.
4) To find the number of flowers left in Peter's garden, we need to subtract the 15 flowers he gave away from the original 60 flowers in his garden.
5) 60 flowers - 15 flowers = 45 flowers.

Answer: 45
