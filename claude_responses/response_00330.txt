Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Laura expects 220 people to attend the wedding.
2) She has been told that approximately 5% typically don't show.
3) To calculate the number of people who won't show, we take 5% of 220:
   * 5% of 220 = 0.05 * 220 = 11
4) So, the number of people who won't show is 11.
5) To calculate the number of people who will go to the wedding, we take the total expected attendance (220) and subtract the number of people who won't show (11):
   * 220 - 11 = 209

Answer: 209
