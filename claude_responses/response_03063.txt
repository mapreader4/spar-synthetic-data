Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Roger has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined.
2) Roger's retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience.
3) Peter's daughter was 7 years old when he joined the company, and now she is 19 years old. This means Peter has been with the company for 12 years.
4) Tom has twice as many years of experience as Robert.
5) Robert has 4 years of experience less than Peter, but 2 more years of experience than Mike.

Now, let's calculate the total years of experience for the four younger coworkers:
* Peter has 12 years of experience
* Robert has 12 - 4 = 8 years of experience
* Tom has 2 * 8 = 16 years of experience
* Mike has 8 - 2 = 6 years of experience

The total years of experience for the four younger coworkers is 12 + 8 + 16 + 6 = 42 years.

Since Roger has the same amount of experience as all four of the others combined, that means Roger has 42 years of experience.

To reach 50 years of experience, Roger needs to work for 50 - 42 = 8 more years.

Answer: 8
