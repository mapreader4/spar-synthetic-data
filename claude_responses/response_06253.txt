To solve this problem, we need to find the average number of licks it takes to get to the center of a lollipop.

Given information:
- Dan takes 58 licks to get to the center of a lollipop.
- Micheal takes 63 licks to get to the center of a lollipop.
- Sam and David each take 70 licks to get to the center of a lollipop.
- Lance takes 39 licks to get to the center of a lollipop.

To calculate the average, we need to add up the number of licks for each person and then divide by the total number of people.

Total number of licks = 58 + 63 + 70 + 70 + 39 = 300 licks

Number of people = 5

Average number of licks = Total number of licks / Number of people
Average number of licks = 300 / 5 = 60 licks

Answer: 60
