Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Thomas is 6 years old
* Shay is 13 years older than Thomas, so Shay is 6 + 13 = 19 years old
* James is 5 years older than Shay, so James is 19 + 5 = 24 years old
* We want to know how old James will be when Thomas reaches his current age of 6 years old
* To find this, we need to determine how many years it will take for Thomas to reach 6 years old
* Thomas is currently 6 years old, so it will take 0 years for him to reach his current age
* Therefore, when Thomas reaches his current age of 6 years old, James will still be 24 years old

Answer: 24
