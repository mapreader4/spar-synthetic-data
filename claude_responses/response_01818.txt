Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Joel picked peppers on the following days:
   - Sunday: 7 peppers
   - Monday: 12 peppers
   - Tuesday: 14 peppers
   - Wednesday: 12 peppers
   - Thursday: 5 peppers
   - Friday: 18 peppers
   - Saturday: 12 peppers
2) In total, he picked 7 + 12 + 14 + 12 + 5 + 18 + 12 = 80 peppers.
3) We know that 20% of the peppers are hot, which means 80% are non-hot.
4) To calculate the number of non-hot peppers, we take 80% of the total number of peppers:
   - 80% of 80 peppers = 0.8 * 80 = 64 non-hot peppers.

Answer: 64
