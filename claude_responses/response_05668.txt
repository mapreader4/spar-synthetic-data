Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Stacy bought 2 packs of printer paper
2) Each pack has 240 sheets of paper
3) So the total number of sheets of paper Stacy bought is 2 x 240 = 480 sheets
4) The office prints 80 one-page documents per day
5) To find how many days the printer paper will last, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets printed per day:
480 sheets / 80 sheets per day = 6 days

Answer: 6 days
