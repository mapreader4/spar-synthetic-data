Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The NGO contracted the construction company to build 2000 houses within one year.
2) In the first half of the year, they built the first 3/5 units of the contracted number.
3) 3/5 of 2000 = 1200 units built in the first half of the year.
4) By October, the company could only build an additional 300 units.
5) The total number of units built so far is 1200 + 300 = 1500 units.
6) The contracted number of units was 2000.
7) The number of units remaining to be built is 2000 - 1500 = 500 units.

Answer: 500
