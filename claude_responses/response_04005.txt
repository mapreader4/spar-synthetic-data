Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Shelby had $20 to take to the book fair.
2) She bought one book for $8 and another for $4.
3) This means she spent $8 + $4 = $12 on the books.
4) She has $20 - $12 = $8 left to spend on the posters.
5) The posters cost $4 each.
6) To find how many posters she can buy, we divide the remaining money ($8) by the cost of each poster ($4).
7) $8 / $4 = 2
