Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We the People has 17 cows.
2) Happy Good Healthy Family has two more than three times the number of cows We the People has.
   * To calculate this, we first find three times the number of cows We the People has: 3 x 17 = 51
   * Then we add 2 to that: 51 + 2 = 53
   * So Happy Good Healthy Family has 53 cows.
3) To find the total number of cows in the ranch, we add the number of cows from We the People and Happy Good Healthy Family:
   * 17 + 53 = 70

Answer: 70
