Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Raine's house is a walking distance from her school
* It takes her 150 steps to walk to the school
* We need to find the total number of steps she takes walking to and from school in five days

To calculate the total number of steps, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of steps for one round trip (to school and back home)
2. Multiply that by the number of days (5)

Step 1: Number of steps for one round trip
* Walking to school: 150 steps
* Walking back home: 150 steps
* Total steps for one round trip: 150 + 150 = 300 steps

Step 2: Total steps in five days
* 300 steps per round trip x 5 days = 1,500 steps

Answer: 1,500
