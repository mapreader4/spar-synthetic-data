Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miss Adamson has 4 classes
* Each class has 20 students
* She uses 5 sheets of paper per student

First, we need to find the total number of students across all 4 classes:
* 4 classes x 20 students per class = 80 students

Next, we need to calculate the total number of sheets of paper used for all students:
* 80 students x 5 sheets of paper per student = 400 sheets of paper

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 400
