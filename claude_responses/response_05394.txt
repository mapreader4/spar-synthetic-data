Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Hannah's sister has 8 dolls.
2) Hannah has 5 times as many dolls as her sister.
3) To find how many dolls Hannah has, we multiply her sister's dolls by 5:
8 dolls x 5 = 40 dolls
4) Now we add the number of dolls Hannah has (40) to the number of dolls her sister has (8) to get the total number of dolls they have altogether.
40 dolls + 8 dolls = 48 dolls

Answer: 48
