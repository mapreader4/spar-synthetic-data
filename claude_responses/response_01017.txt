Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Stacy has 2 more than triple as many berries as Steve.
   * Let's say Steve has x berries.
   * Then Stacy has 3x + 2 berries.
2) Steve has one half as many berries as Skylar.
   * Skylar has 20 berries.
   * So Steve has 1/2 * 20 = 10 berries.
3) Now we can plug in the values we know:
   * Steve has 10 berries.
   * Stacy has 3 * 10 + 2 = 32 berries.

Answer: 32
