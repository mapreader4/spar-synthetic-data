Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 25 different layers of rock in the canyon's strata.
2) 5 of the layers are limestone.
3) The remaining 20 layers are not limestone.
4) Half of the remaining 20 layers are sandstone, which means 10 layers are sandstone.
5) The remaining 10 layers are not sandstone.
6) 4 of the remaining 10 layers are quartz.
7) The remaining 6 layers are not quartz.
8) Half of the remaining 6 layers are shale, which means 3 layers are shale.
9) The remaining 3 layers are not shale.
10) Therefore, the number of kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata is 3.
