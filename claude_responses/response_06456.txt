Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total rent is $1200 per year
* Mrs. McPherson will raise 30% of the total rent
* To calculate 30% of $1200:
    - 30% of $1200 = 0.3 * $1200 = $360
* So Mrs. McPherson will raise $360
* The remaining amount that needs to be raised is the total rent minus the amount Mrs. McPherson is raising:
    - $1200 - $360 = $840
* Therefore, Mr. McPherson needs to raise $840 to complete the rent.

Answer: $840
