Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackson's oldest son gets 4 cookies after school
* Jackson's youngest son gets 2 cookies after school
* There are 54 cookies in the box

To find out how many days the box will last, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed per day.

The total number of cookies consumed per day is:
* Oldest son: 4 cookies
* Youngest son: 2 cookies
* Total cookies consumed per day: 4 + 2 = 6 cookies

Now, we can divide the total number of cookies in the box (54) by the number of cookies consumed per day (6) to find out how many days the box will last.

Answer: 54 / 6 = 9 days
