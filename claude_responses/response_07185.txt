Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Avery has 20 chickens on his farm.
2) Each chicken lays 6 eggs.
3) To find the total number of eggs, we multiply the number of chickens (20) by the number of eggs each chicken lays (6):
20 chickens x 6 eggs per chicken = 120 eggs
4) Each egg carton can hold a dozen (12) eggs.
5) To find the number of egg cartons Avery can fill, we divide the total number of eggs (120) by the number of eggs each carton can hold (12):
120 eggs / 12 eggs per carton = 10 cartons

Answer: 10
