Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tricia buys large bottles of iced coffee with 6 servings per container
* She drinks half a container per day
* The coffee is on sale for $3.00 per bottle

First, we need to calculate how many servings Tricia will need for 2 weeks:
* 2 weeks = 14 days
* She drinks half a container per day
* So, she will need 14 * 0.5 = 7 containers worth of servings

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles she will need to buy:
* Each bottle has 6 servings
* She needs 7 containers worth of servings
* So, she will need to buy 7 / 6 = 1.17 bottles
* Since we can't buy a fraction of a bottle, we need to round up to the nearest whole number
* So, Tricia will need to buy 2 bottles

Finally, we can calculate the total cost:
* Each bottle costs $3.00
* Tricia needs to buy 2 bottles
* So, the total cost will be 2 * $3.00 = $6.00

Answer: $6.00
