Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 60 questions on the test
* 30 are multiple-choice and 30 are fill-in-the-blank
* It takes Martiza 15 minutes to learn each multiple-choice question
* It takes Martiza 25 minutes to learn each fill-in-the-blank question

To calculate the total time needed to study:
* For the 30 multiple-choice questions:
  * 30 questions x 15 minutes per question = 450 minutes
* For the 30 fill-in-the-blank questions:
  * 30 questions x 25 minutes per question = 750 minutes
* Total time needed = 450 minutes + 750 minutes = 1200 minutes

Now, to convert the total minutes to hours:
* 1200 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 20 hours

Therefore, Martiza will need 20 hours to study before she is ready for the test.

Answer: 20
