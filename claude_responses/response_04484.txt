Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Diego's monthly paycheck is $5,000
* His monthly expenses are $4,600
* To calculate the amount he saves each month, we take his paycheck and subtract his expenses:
* $5,000 - $4,600 = $400
* Now, to calculate the amount he saves over the course of a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 months:
* $400 x 12 = $4,800

Answer: $4,800
