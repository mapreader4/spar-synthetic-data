Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marcy can make 3 spears out of a sapling
* Marcy can make 9 spears out of a log
* Marcy has 6 saplings and 1 log
* To find the total number of spears she can make, we need to:
  1. Calculate the number of spears from the 6 saplings
  2. Calculate the number of spears from the 1 log
  3. Add the two numbers together

Step 1: Number of spears from 6 saplings
* 6 saplings x 3 spears per sapling = 18 spears

Step 2: Number of spears from 1 log
* 1 log x 9 spears per log = 9 spears

Step 3: Total number of spears
* 18 spears (from 6 saplings) + 9 spears (from 1 log) = 27 spears

Answer: 27
