Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Johnny wrote an essay with 150 words.
2) Madeline wrote an essay that was double the length of Johnny's, which means it had 150 x 2 = 300 words.
3) Timothy wrote an essay that had 30 words more than Madeline's, which means it had 300 + 30 = 330 words.
4) One page contains 260 words.
5) To find the number of pages each essay fills, we divide the number of words in each essay by the number of words per page (260):
   - Johnny's essay: 150 words / 260 words per page = 0.577 pages, which rounds up to 1 page.
   - Madeline's essay: 300 words / 260 words per page = 1.154 pages, which rounds up to 2 pages.
   - Timothy's essay: 330 words / 260 words per page = 1.269 pages, which rounds up to 2 pages.

Answer: Johnny's essay fills 1 page, Madeline's essay fills 2 pages, and Timothy's essay fills 2 pages.
