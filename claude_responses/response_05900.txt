Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each coconut tree yields 5 coconuts.
2) Each coconut can be sold for $3.
3) Alvin needs $90.
4) To calculate the number of coconut trees Alvin needs to harvest, we need to find how many coconuts he needs to sell to make $90.
5) To make $90, he needs to sell 30 coconuts (90 / 3 = 30).
6) Since each tree yields 5 coconuts, he needs to harvest 6 trees to get 30 coconuts (30 / 5 = 6).
