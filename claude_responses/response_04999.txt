Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Chastity bought 4 lollipops at $1.50 each. So the total cost of the lollipops is:
4 lollipops x $1.50 per lollipop = $6
2) Chastity also bought 2 packs of gummies at $2 each. So the total cost of the gummies is:
2 packs x $2 per pack = $4
3) The total amount Chastity spent on the candies is the sum of the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the gummies:
$6 + $4 = $10
4) Chastity had $15 to start with. To calculate how much she was left with after spending on the candies, we subtract the total amount spent ($10) from the amount she had ($15):
$15 - $10 = $5

Answer: $5
