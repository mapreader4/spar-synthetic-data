Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* In the first week, the company hired 200 more employees than in the second week.
* In the second week, the company hired 150 fewer employees than in the third week.
* In the fourth week, the company hired twice the number of employees as in the third week.
* The total number of employees hired in the fourth week was 400.

Now, let's solve for the number of employees hired in each week:
* Let's call the number of employees hired in the third week 'x'.
* Then, the number of employees hired in the fourth week is 2x.
* The number of employees hired in the second week is x - 150.
* The number of employees hired in the first week is x + 200.

We know that the total number of employees hired in the fourth week is 400, so:
* 2x = 400
* x = 200

Therefore, the number of employees hired in each week is:
* First week: 200 + 200 = 400
* Second week: 200 - 150 = 50
* Third week: 200
* Fourth week: 400

Now, we can calculate the average number of employees hired per week:
* Total employees hired = 400 + 50 + 200 + 400 = 1050
* Number of weeks = 4
* Average employees hired per week = 1050 / 4 = 262.5
