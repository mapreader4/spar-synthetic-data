Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day.
2. Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects.
   * Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs, so Carla collects 3 x 6 = 18 dozen eggs.
3. Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin.
   * Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs, so Trisha collects 6 - 4 = 2 dozen eggs.

Now, to find the total number of dozen eggs collected by the three:
* Benjamin: 6 dozen
* Carla: 18 dozen
* Trisha: 2 dozen
* Total: 6 + 18 + 2 = 26 dozen eggs

Answer: 26
