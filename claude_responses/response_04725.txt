Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* For every moose, there are 2 beavers
* For every beaver, there are 19 humans
* There are 38 million people in Canada

First, we can find the number of beavers in Canada:
* Since there are 38 million people, and each beaver has 19 humans, we can divide 38 million by 19 to get the number of beavers
* 38 million / 19 = 2 million beavers

Next, we can find the number of moose in Canada:
* Since there are 2 beavers for every moose, we can divide the number of beavers (2 million) by 2 to get the number of moose
* 2 million beavers / 2 = 1 million moose

Therefore, the moose population of Canada is 1 million.
