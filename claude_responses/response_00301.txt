Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 240 sixth-grade students in total.
* 1/6 of the students read three or more novels. 1/6 of 240 is 40 students.
* 35% of the students read two novels. 35% of 240 is 84 students.
* 5/12 of the students read one novel. 5/12 of 240 is 100 students.
* The rest of the students do not read anything. 
* To find the number of students who do not read novels, we need to subtract the number of students who read novels from the total number of students.
* The number of students who read novels is 40 + 84 + 100 = 224.
* The number of students who do not read novels is 240 - 224 = 16.

Answer: 16
