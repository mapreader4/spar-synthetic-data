Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Nico borrows 3 books from the library on Monday.
* On Monday, he reads the first book with a total of 20 pages.
* On Tuesday, he reads the second book with a total of 12 pages.
* On Wednesday, he reads the third book.
* He has read a total of 51 pages from Monday to Wednesday.

To find the number of pages he read on Wednesday, we need to subtract the pages he read on Monday and Tuesday from the total pages he read.

Pages read on Monday: 20
Pages read on Tuesday: 12
Total pages read from Monday to Wednesday: 51

Pages read on Wednesday = Total pages read - Pages read on Monday - Pages read on Tuesday
Pages read on Wednesday = 51 - 20 - 12 = 19

Answer: 19
