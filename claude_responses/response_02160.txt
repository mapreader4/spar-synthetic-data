Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John's shirt cost 60% more than his pants.
2) His pants cost $50.
3) To find the cost of the shirt, we need to add 60% of $50 to the cost of the pants.
4) 60% of $50 is 0.6 * $50 = $30.
5) So the cost of the shirt is $50 + $30 = $80.
6) The total cost of John's outfit is the cost of the pants ($50) plus the cost of the shirt ($80).
7) Therefore, the total cost of John's outfit is $50 + $80 = $130.

Answer: $130
