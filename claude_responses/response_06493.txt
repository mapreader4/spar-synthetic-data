Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Michael needs 6 cups of flour for the cake
* The only measuring cup he has is the 1/4 cup
* He has an 8 cup bag of flour
* To measure the 6 cups of flour he needs, he would need to scoop out 6 cups / 1/4 cup per scoop = 24 scoops
* However, he can make this process faster by removing the amount of flour he doesn't need, which is 8 cups - 6 cups = 2 cups
* To remove 2 cups of flour, he would need to scoop out 2 cups / 1/4 cup per scoop = 8 scoops

Answer: 8 scoops
