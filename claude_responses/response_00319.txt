Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Natalie's sister had 8 small diaries in her locker.
2) Last summer, she bought double the number of diaries she had.
   * So, she bought 8 x 2 = 16 more diaries.
   * Now, she has 8 + 16 = 24 diaries.
3) She then lost 1/4 of what she had.
   * 1/4 of 24 is 24 x 0.25 = 6.
   * She lost 6 diaries.
   * Now, she has 24 - 6 = 18 diaries.

Answer: 18
