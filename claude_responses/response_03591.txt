Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Pima invested $400 in Ethereum.
2) In the first week, the investment gained 25% in value.
   * 25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100
   * So, the investment is now worth $400 + $100 = $500.
3) In the second week, the investment gained an additional 50% on top of the previous gain.
   * 50% of $500 = 0.50 * $500 = $250
   * So, the investment is now worth $500 + $250 = $750.

Answer: $750
