Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Herman stops at the drive-through 5 days a week
* Each time, he buys a breakfast combo for himself and 3 members of his team
* Each meal costs $4.00
* The current project will last 16 weeks

To calculate the total amount Herman will spend on breakfast, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of breakfast per day
2. Multiply the daily cost by the number of days per week
3. Multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks

1. Cost of breakfast per day:
   * 4 meals at $4.00 each = $16.00 per day

2. Cost of breakfast per week:
   * 5 days per week x $16.00 per day = $80.00 per week

3. Cost of breakfast for the entire project:
   * 16 weeks x $80.00 per week = $1,280.00

Answer: $1,280
