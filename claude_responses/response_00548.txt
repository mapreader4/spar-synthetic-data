Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first center processes 10,000 packages per day
* The second center processes three times that volume, which is 3 x 10,000 = 30,000 packages per day
* So the total number of packages processed per day by the two centers is 10,000 + 30,000 = 40,000 packages
* Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package
* To calculate the total profit per day, we multiply the total number of packages by the profit per package: 40,000 x $0.05 = $2,000 per day
* There are 7 days in a week, so the total profit per week is $2,000 x 7 = $14,000

Answer: $14,000
