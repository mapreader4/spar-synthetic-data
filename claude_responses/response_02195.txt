Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shane drives a total of 10 miles per day, which includes the distance from home to school and back.
* The semester lasts for 80 days.
* To calculate the total distance driven, we need to multiply the distance per day (10 miles) by the number of days in the semester (80 days).

So, the total distance Shane drives in an 80 day semester is:
10 miles per day x 80 days = 800 miles

Answer: 800
