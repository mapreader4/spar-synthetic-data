Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cyrus counted 14 mosquito bites on his arms and legs, and another 10 on his body, for a total of 24 bites.
2) The rest of Cyrus' family (6 people) got a total of half the number of bites that Cyrus got.
3) So the total number of bites for the rest of the family is 24 / 2 = 12 bites.
4) Since the bites are equally distributed among the 6 family members, each member of the rest of Cyrus' family has 12 / 6 = 2 mosquito bites.
