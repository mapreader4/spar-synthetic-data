Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marion's bike costs $356
* Stephanie's bike is worth twice as much as Marion's bike
* To find the price of Stephanie's bike, we multiply Marion's bike cost by 2:
  * Stephanie's bike cost = $356 x 2 = $712
* To find the total price of their bikes, we add the cost of Marion's bike and Stephanie's bike:
  * Total price = $356 + $712 = $1,068

Answer: $1,068
