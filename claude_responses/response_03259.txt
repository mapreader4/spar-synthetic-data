Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Michael has $42 to start with.
2) Michael gives away half of his money to his brother. So, his brother receives $21.
3) His brother then buys $3 worth of candy.
4) His brother has $35 left.

To find out how much money his brother had at first, we can work backwards:
* His brother has $35 left after buying $3 worth of candy.
* So, before buying the candy, his brother had $35 + $3 = $38.
* We know that his brother received $21 from Michael.
* Therefore, the amount of money his brother had at first was $38.

Answer: $38.
