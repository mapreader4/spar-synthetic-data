Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of the shoes is $125.
2) Mothers get a 10% discount on the original price.
3) To calculate the 10% discount, we take 10% of $125, which is $12.50.
4) So the discounted price is $125 - $12.50 = $112.50.
5) Since Mrs. Brown has 4 children, which is 3 or more, she gets an additional 4% off the discounted price.
6) To calculate the 4% discount, we take 4% of $112.50, which is $4.50.
7) So the final price she will pay is $112.50 - $4.50 = $108.00.

Answer: $108
