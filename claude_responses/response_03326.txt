Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The question states that the tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh 6000 pounds.
* We are told that one ton is equal to 2000 pounds.
* To find the weight of the blue whale's tongue in tons, we need to divide the weight in pounds by the number of pounds in a ton.
* 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per ton = 3 tons.

Answer: 3 tons.
