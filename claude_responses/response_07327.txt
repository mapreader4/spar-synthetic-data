Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Betty starts with 60 cookies and 10 brownies
* She eats 3 cookies and 1 brownie per day
* We want to know how many more cookies than brownies she has after a week (7 days)

First, let's calculate how many cookies and brownies she eats in a week:
* Cookies eaten in a week: 3 cookies/day x 7 days = 21 cookies
* Brownies eaten in a week: 1 brownie/day x 7 days = 7 brownies

Now, let's calculate how many cookies and brownies she has left after a week:
* Cookies left: 60 cookies - 21 cookies = 39 cookies
* Brownies left: 10 brownies - 7 brownies = 3 brownies

Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of cookies and brownies left:
* Difference: 39 cookies - 3 brownies = 36 more cookies than brownies

Answer: 36
