Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 7 yellow highlighters in Carrie's desk drawer.
2) There are 7 more pink highlighters than yellow highlighters. So, the number of pink highlighters is 7 + 7 = 14.
3) There are 5 more blue highlighters than pink highlighters. So, the number of blue highlighters is 14 + 5 = 19.
4) To find the total number of highlighters, we add up the yellow, pink, and blue highlighters:
7 + 14 + 19 = 40

Answer: 40
