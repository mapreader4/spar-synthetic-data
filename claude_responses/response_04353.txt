Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Norris saved $29 in September, $25 in October, and $31 in November.
2) To calculate the total amount Norris saved, we add these three amounts together:
$29 + $25 + $31 = $85
3) Hugo then spent $75 on an online game.
4) To calculate the amount of money Norris has left, we subtract the $75 spent by Hugo from the $85 Norris saved:
$85 - $75 = $10
Answer: 10
