Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Renne earns $4000 per month
* She wants to save half of her monthly earnings
* The vehicle she wants to buy costs $16000

To calculate how many months it will take her to save up the $16000, we need to first determine how much she can save each month:
* She saves half of her monthly earnings, which is $4000 / 2 = $2000 per month

Now, we can divide the total cost of the vehicle ($16000) by the amount she saves each month ($2000) to determine how many months it will take her to save up the full amount:
* $16000 / $2000 per month = 8 months

Answer: 8
