Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that each level has 8 huge steps in the stairs.
2) Each step is made up of 3 massive blocks of stone.
3) We are told that Clara has climbed past 96 blocks of stone.
4) To find the number of levels, we need to determine how many blocks of stone are in each level.
5) Each level has 8 steps, and each step has 3 blocks of stone.
6) So, each level has 8 * 3 = 24 blocks of stone.
7) We know that Clara has climbed past 96 blocks of stone.
8) To find the number of levels, we divide 96 by 24 (the number of blocks per level).
9) 96 / 24 = 4
