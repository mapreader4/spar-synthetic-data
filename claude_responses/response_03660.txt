Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marco's ice cream cones cost $5 each.
2) His expenses are 80% of his total sales for the day.
3) He wants to make a $200 profit for the day.
4) To calculate the total sales needed, we need to first calculate the total expenses:
   * Expenses = 80% of total sales
   * Total sales = Expenses / 0.8
5) Now we can calculate the total sales needed to make a $200 profit:
   * Total sales = (Expenses + $200) / 0.8
   * Total sales = ($200 + $200) / 0.8
   * Total sales = $500
6) Finally, we can calculate the number of ice cream cones he needs to sell:
   * Number of ice cream cones = Total sales / $5 per cone
   * Number of ice cream cones = $500 / $5
   * Number of ice cream cones = 100

Answer: 100
