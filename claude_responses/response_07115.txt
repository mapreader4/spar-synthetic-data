Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jake trips over his dog 40% of mornings
* 25% of the time he trips, he drops his coffee
* To find the percentage of mornings he does NOT drop his coffee, we need to find the complement of the percentage of mornings he does drop his coffee

First, let's find the percentage of mornings he drops his coffee:
* 40% of mornings, he trips
* 25% of the time he trips, he drops his coffee
* So, 40% * 25% = 10% of mornings, he drops his coffee

Now, to find the percentage of mornings he does NOT drop his coffee, we take the complement:
* 100% - 10% = 90%

Answer: 90
