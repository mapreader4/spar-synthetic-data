Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The sheet of dough is 12 inches by 12 inches, which means the total area of the dough is 12 inches x 12 inches = 144 square inches.
2) Each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches, which means the area of each biscuit is 3 inches x 3 inches = 9 square inches.
3) To find the number of biscuits Unique can make, we need to divide the total area of the dough by the area of each biscuit.
4) 144 square inches / 9 square inches per biscuit = 16 biscuits.
