Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The group has 20 people
* Each person contributes an average of 10 pins per day
* The group owner deletes 5 pins per week per person
* The total number of pins is 1000

First, let's calculate the number of pins added per day:
* 20 people x 10 pins per day = 200 pins added per day

Next, let's calculate the number of pins deleted per week:
* 20 people x 5 pins per week = 100 pins deleted per week

Now, let's calculate the number of pins added and deleted in a month (4 weeks):
* Pins added in a month: 200 pins/day x 30 days = 6000 pins
* Pins deleted in a month: 100 pins/week x 4 weeks = 400 pins

Finally, let's calculate the total number of pins after a month:
* Total pins = Initial pins + Pins added - Pins deleted
* Total pins = 1000 + 6000 - 400 = 6600 pins

Answer: 6600 pins
