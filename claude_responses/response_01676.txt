Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mikaela bought 16 containers of paint to cover the four equally-sized walls in the bathroom
* Since there are four equally-sized walls, that means each wall requires 4 containers of paint (16 containers / 4 walls = 4 containers per wall)
* However, Mikaela decided to put tile on one wall, so she only needs to paint three walls
* That means she only needs 12 containers of paint for the three walls (3 walls x 4 containers per wall = 12 containers)
* Mikaela also decided to paint flowers on the ceiling, which requires 1 container of paint
* So in total, Mikaela will use 12 containers for the walls and 1 container for the ceiling, which is 13 containers
* She originally bought 16 containers, so the number of containers she will have left over is:
Answer: 16 - 13 = 3
