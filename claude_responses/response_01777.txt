Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Total donations: 300
* Basketball hoops: 60
* Half of the basketball hoops also had basketballs included: 60 / 2 = 30 basketballs
* Pool floats: 120
* A quarter of the pool floats were damaged and discarded: 120 * 0.25 = 30 pool floats discarded
* Remaining pool floats: 120 - 30 = 90 pool floats
* Footballs: 50
* Tennis balls: 40
* Remaining donations were basketballs
* Total donations - basketball hoops - pool floats - footballs - tennis balls = remaining basketballs
* 300 - 60 - 90 - 50 - 40 = 60 basketballs

Answer: 60
