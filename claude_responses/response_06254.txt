Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Geoffrey received money from his grandmother (€20), aunt (€25), and uncle (€30).
2) Adding up the money he received, that's €20 + €25 + €30 = €75.
3) He already had some money, and with the €75 he received, he now has €125 in his wallet.
4) So the amount he had before receiving the money from his family was €125 - €75 = €50.
5) He then went to the video game store and bought 3 games that cost €35 each.
6) The total cost of the 3 games is 3 * €35 = €105.
7) He had €50 before the purchase, and he spent €105 on the games.
8) So the amount he has left is €50 - €105 = -€55.

Answer: -€55
