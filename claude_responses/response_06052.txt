Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Valentino has 200 chickens
* He has twice as many ducks as chickens
* To find the number of ducks, we multiply the number of chickens by 2:
  * Number of ducks = 200 x 2 = 400
* He has three times as many turkeys as ducks
* To find the number of turkeys, we multiply the number of ducks by 3:
  * Number of turkeys = 400 x 3 = 1,200
* To find the total number of birds, we add up the number of chickens, ducks, and turkeys:
  * Total number of birds = 200 + 400 + 1,200 = 1,800

Answer: 1,800
