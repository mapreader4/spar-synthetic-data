Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The mother planted a 16-inch tree on the boy's first birthday
* On the day the tree was planted, the boy was 24 inches tall
* The tree grows twice as fast as the boy
* We want to find the height of the tree when the boy is 36 inches tall

First, let's calculate how much the boy has grown since the tree was planted:
* The boy was 24 inches tall when the tree was planted
* The boy will be 36 inches tall when we want to find the tree's height
* So the boy has grown 36 inches - 24 inches = 12 inches

Since the tree grows twice as fast as the boy, we can calculate the tree's growth:
* The tree grows twice as fast as the boy
* The boy has grown 12 inches
* So the tree has grown 2 * 12 inches = 24 inches

Now we can add the tree's initial height to its growth to find the final height:
* The tree was initially 16 inches tall
* The tree has grown 24 inches
* So the final height of the tree is 16 inches + 24 inches = 40 inches

Answer: 40 inches
