Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jerry has two daughters who play softball on different teams
* Each daughter has 8 games this season
* Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play
* Each game lasts for 2 hours

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jerry will spend watching his daughters play:
* 8 games per daughter x 2 hours per game = 16 hours per daughter
* 16 hours per daughter x 2 daughters = 32 hours

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Jerry will spend watching his daughters practice:
* 8 games per daughter x 4 hours of practice per game = 32 hours of practice per daughter
* 32 hours of practice per daughter x 2 daughters = 64 hours

Finally, we add the time spent watching the games and the time spent watching the practices:
* 32 hours + 64 hours = 96 hours

Answer: 96
