Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Roger's age is 5 more than twice Jill's age. This means:
   Roger's age = 2 * Jill's age + 5

2. Jill is 20 years old now, so:
   Roger's age = 2 * 20 + 5 = 45

3. In 15 years, their age difference will be 30 years less than Finley's age. This means:
   (Roger's age + 15) - (Jill's age + 15) = Finley's age - 30

4. Substituting the values we know:
   (45 + 15) - (20 + 15) = Finley's age - 30
   60 - 35 = Finley's age - 30
   25 = Finley's age - 30

5. Solving for Finley's age:
   Finley's age = 25 + 30 = 55

Answer: 55
