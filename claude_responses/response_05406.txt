Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that the cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket.
2) Let's call the cost of a child ticket 'x'.
3) Then the cost of an adult ticket is 'x + 6'.
4) The total cost of the 5 tickets is $77.
5) So we can write the equation: 2(x + 6) + 3x = 77
6) Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 12 + 3x = 77
7) 5x + 12 = 77
8) 5x = 65
9) x = 13
10) Therefore, the cost of an adult ticket is 13 + 6 = $19.
