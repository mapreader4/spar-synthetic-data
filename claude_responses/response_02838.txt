Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lionel walked 4 miles. We need to convert this to feet.
   * 1 mile = 5,280 feet
   * 4 miles = 4 * 5,280 = 21,120 feet
2) Esther walked 975 yards. We need to convert this to feet.
   * 1 yard = 3 feet
   * 975 yards = 975 * 3 = 2,925 feet
3) Niklaus walked 1287 feet.
4) Now we add up the total feet walked by all three friends:
   * 21,120 feet + 2,925 feet + 1,287 feet = 25,332 feet

Answer: 25,332 feet
