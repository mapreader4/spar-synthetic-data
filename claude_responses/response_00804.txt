Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The zoo has 16 pandas
* The pandas are paired into mates, so there are 8 panda couples
* Only 25% of the panda couples get pregnant after mating
* If the pregnant couples each have one baby, we need to calculate how many babies are born

First, we need to calculate how many panda couples get pregnant:
* 25% of 8 couples = 0.25 * 8 = 2 couples

Since each pregnant couple has one baby, the total number of panda babies born is:
* 2 babies

Answer: 2
