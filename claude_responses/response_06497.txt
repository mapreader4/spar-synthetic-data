Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 36 marbles in total.
2) The marbles are divided between Mario and Manny in the ratio 4:5.
3) To find the number of marbles each person gets, we need to find the total parts in the ratio and then divide the total marbles by the total parts.
4) The total parts in the ratio 4:5 is 4 + 5 = 9.
5) 36 marbles divided by 9 total parts means each part is worth 4 marbles.
6) Mario gets 4 parts, so he gets 4 * 4 = 16 marbles.
7) Manny gets 5 parts, so he gets 5 * 4 = 20 marbles.
8) Manny then gives 2 marbles to Mario, so Manny now has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles.

Answer: 18
