Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Taro and Vlad play a video game competition together
* They earn 5 points for every win
* They played 30 rounds in total
* Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points scored

First, let's calculate the total points scored in the 30 rounds:
* 30 rounds x 5 points per win = 150 total points

Now, let's calculate 3/5 of the total points:
* 3/5 of 150 = 90 points

Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points, so:
* Taro's score = 90 - 4 = 86 points

Now, we can calculate Vlad's score by subtracting Taro's score from the total points:
* Vlad's score = 150 - 86 = 64 points

Answer: 64
