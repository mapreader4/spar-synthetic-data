Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emily has 4 dogs
* Each dog eats 250 grams of food per day
* Emily will be gone for 14 days

To calculate the total amount of food needed, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount of food needed per day for all 4 dogs
2. Multiply that amount by the number of days Emily will be gone

Step 1: Total amount of food needed per day for all 4 dogs
* Each dog eats 250 grams per day
* 4 dogs x 250 grams per dog = 1000 grams per day

Step 2: Total amount of food needed for the 14 days
* 1000 grams per day x 14 days = 14,000 grams

To convert this to kilograms, we divide by 1000:
* 14,000 grams / 1000 = 14 kilograms

Answer: 14 kilograms
