Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The group took 9 vans
* There were 8 people in each van
* So the number of people in the vans is: 9 vans x 8 people per van = 72 people

* The group also took 10 buses
* There were 27 people on each bus
* So the number of people in the buses is: 10 buses x 27 people per bus = 270 people

* To find the total number of people who went on the field trip, we add the number of people in the vans and the number of people in the buses:
* 72 people + 270 people = 342 people

Answer: 342
