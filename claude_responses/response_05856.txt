Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Milly's math homework takes 60 minutes.
2. Her geography homework takes half as long as her math homework, which means it takes 30 minutes (60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes).
3. Her science homework takes the mean amount of time she spent studying math and geography.
   - The mean is the average of the two values.
   - The mean time spent studying math and geography is (60 minutes + 30 minutes) / 2 = 45 minutes.
4. To find the total time Milly spends studying, we add up the time for each subject:
   - Math: 60 minutes
   - Geography: 30 minutes
   - Science: 45 minutes
   - Total time: 60 minutes + 30 minutes + 45 minutes = 135 minutes.

Answer: 135 minutes.
