Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sanya can wash 7 bath towels in 1 hour.
2) She has 2 hours in a day to do this task.
3) So in 2 hours, she can wash 7 x 2 = 14 bath towels per day.
4) She has 98 bath towels to wash.
5) To calculate the number of days needed, we divide the total number of bath towels (98) by the number of bath towels she can wash per day (14).
6) 98 / 14 = 7 days.

Answer: 7 days.
