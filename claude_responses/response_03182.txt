Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The original price of the shirt was $60.
2) The original price of the leather jacket was $90.
3) The prices were reduced by 20% after the subsidy.
4) To calculate the new prices:
   - Shirt: $60 - (20% of $60) = $60 - $12 = $48
   - Leather Jacket: $90 - (20% of $90) = $90 - $18 = $72
5) Teagan is buying:
   - 5 shirts at $48 each
   - 10 leather jackets at $72 each
6) To calculate the total amount Teagan will pay:
   - 5 shirts at $48 each = 5 x $48 = $240
   - 10 leather jackets at $72 each = 10 x $72 = $720
   - Total = $240 + $720 = $960

Answer: 960
