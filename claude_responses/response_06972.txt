Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that each bag of caramel cookies has 20 cookies inside.
2) We also know that the box contains 4 bags of cookies.
3) To find the total number of cookies in the box, we multiply the number of cookies per bag (20) by the number of bags in the box (4):
20 cookies per bag x 4 bags = 80 cookies in the box
4) Each cookie is 20 calories, so to find the total calories in the box, we multiply the total number of cookies (80) by the calories per cookie (20):
80 cookies x 20 calories per cookie = 1,600 calories in the box
Answer: 1,600
