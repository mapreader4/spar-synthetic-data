Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack borrowed $1200 from Jill last week
* He promised to pay back the $1200 with an interest of 10%
* To calculate the total amount Jack will pay back, we need to find the interest amount and add it to the original loan amount

To find the interest amount:
* Interest rate = 10% = 0.10
* Interest amount = Original loan amount × Interest rate
* Interest amount = $1200 × 0.10 = $120

Now, to find the total amount Jack will pay back:
* Total amount = Original loan amount + Interest amount
* Total amount = $1200 + $120 = $1320

Answer: $1320
