To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jack catching either Zika virus or malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito.

Given information:
- 40% of the mosquitos in Jack's area are infected with malaria.
- 20% of the mosquitos are infected with Zika virus.
- Without a vaccine, the chances of getting infected with either virus after getting bitten by an infected mosquito are 50%.
- Jack is taking an experimental malaria vaccine that reduces the chances of getting infected after getting bitten by 50%.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of Jack catching malaria after being bitten by a random mosquito.
Probability of a mosquito being infected with malaria = 40%
Probability of getting infected with malaria after being bitten by an infected mosquito = 50% × (1 - 50%) = 25%
Probability of catching malaria = 40% × 25% = 10%

Step 2: Calculate the probability of Jack catching Zika virus after being bitten by a random mosquito.
Probability of a mosquito being infected with Zika virus = 20%
Probability of getting infected with Zika virus after being bitten by an infected mosquito = 50%
Probability of catching Zika virus = 20% × 50% = 10%

Step 3: Calculate the total probability of Jack catching either Zika virus or malaria.
Total probability = Probability of catching malaria + Probability of catching Zika virus
Total probability = 10% + 10% = 20%

Answer: 20%
