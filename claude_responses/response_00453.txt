Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jillian collected 29 shells
* Savannah collected 17 shells
* Clayton collected 8 shells
* So the total number of shells collected is 29 + 17 + 8 = 54 shells
* They want to distribute these 54 shells evenly to two friends
* To distribute the shells evenly, we need to divide the total number of shells by 2
* 54 รท 2 = 27
* Therefore, each friend will get 27 shells.

Answer: 27
