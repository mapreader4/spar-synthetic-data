Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wendy has 5 facial products she puts on in the morning
* She waits 5 minutes between each product
* She spends an additional 30 minutes putting on her make-up

To calculate the total time it takes her to put on her "full face":
* Time for 5 facial products: 5 products x 5 minutes each = 25 minutes
* Time for make-up: 30 minutes
* Total time: 25 minutes + 30 minutes = 55 minutes

Answer: 55 minutes
