Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The company produced 3000 masks in March.
* The production was doubled every month after March.
* To find the production in July, we need to double the production for 4 months (April, May, June, July).
* In April, the production would be 3000 * 2 = 6000 masks.
* In May, the production would be 6000 * 2 = 12,000 masks.
* In June, the production would be 12,000 * 2 = 24,000 masks.
* In July, the production would be 24,000 * 2 = 48,000 masks.

Answer: 48,000
