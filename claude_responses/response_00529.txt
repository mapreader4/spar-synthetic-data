To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of rides required for the 30-day pass to be cheaper per ride than the one-way ticket.

Given information:
- One-way ticket costs $2.
- 30-day pass costs $50.

Let's assume the minimum number of rides required is x.

For the 30-day pass to be cheaper per ride, the following condition must be true:
$50 / x < $2 per ride

Rearranging the inequality, we get:
x > $50 / $2 = 25

Therefore, the minimum number of rides you will need to take every month so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride is 26.

Answer: 26
