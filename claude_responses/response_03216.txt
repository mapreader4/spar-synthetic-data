Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Last year, Kyle picked a dozen roses, which is 12 roses.
* This year, Kyle was only able to pick half the number of roses, which is 12 / 2 = 6 roses.
* Kyle wants to give his mother a bouquet with twice as many roses as last year, which is 2 * 12 = 24 roses.
* The grocery store sells one rose for $3.
* To calculate the total cost, we need to find the number of roses Kyle needs to buy, which is 24 - 6 = 18 roses.
* The total cost would be 18 roses * $3 per rose = $54.

Answer: $54
