Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The tallest tree is 150 feet tall.
2) The middle height tree is 2/3 the height of the tallest tree.
   * To calculate the height of the middle tree, we take 2/3 of 150 feet:
   * 2/3 * 150 feet = 100 feet
3) The shortest tree is half the size of the middle tree.
   * To calculate the height of the shortest tree, we take 1/2 of 100 feet:
   * 1/2 * 100 feet = 50 feet

Answer: 50 feet
