Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The shop "Surprise" is closed for 3 days during the Christmas holidays
* During each of those 3 days, the shop could have earned $5,000
* We want to know the potential revenue lost over 6 years of activity

To calculate the potential revenue lost, we need to:
1. Calculate the potential revenue lost per year
2. Multiply that by 6 years

Potential revenue lost per year:
* 3 days x $5,000 per day = $15,000 per year

Potential revenue lost over 6 years:
* $15,000 per year x 6 years = $90,000

Answer: 90,000
