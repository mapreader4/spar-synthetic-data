Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Xavier is twice as old as Yasmin
* Xavier will be 30 years old in six years
* To find Xavier's current age, we subtract 6 years from 30 years
* Xavier's current age = 30 - 6 = 24 years old
* Since Xavier is twice as old as Yasmin, Yasmin's current age is half of Xavier's current age
* Yasmin's current age = 24 / 2 = 12 years old
* To find the total of their ages now, we add Xavier's current age and Yasmin's current age:
* Total of their ages = 24 + 12 = 36 years old

Answer: 36
