Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tickets for students cost $6 each
* 20 students bought tickets
* So the total cost for student tickets is 20 * $6 = $120
* Tickets for adults cost $8 each
* 12 adults bought tickets
* So the total cost for adult tickets is 12 * $8 = $96
* To find the total dollars' worth of tickets sold, we add the student ticket cost and the adult ticket cost:
* $120 + $96 = $216

Answer: $216
