Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Carson harvests 400 pounds of seaweed
* 50% of the seaweed is only good for starting fires
* So, 50% of 400 pounds = 0.5 * 400 = 200 pounds of seaweed is only good for starting fires
* That leaves 400 - 200 = 200 pounds of seaweed remaining
* 25% of the remaining 200 pounds can be eaten by humans
* 25% of 200 pounds = 0.25 * 200 = 50 pounds of seaweed can be eaten by humans
* That leaves 200 - 50 = 150 pounds of seaweed remaining
* The rest of the seaweed, 150 pounds, is fed to livestock

Answer: 150 pounds
