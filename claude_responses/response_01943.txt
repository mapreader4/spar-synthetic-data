To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for the family to visit the park and one attraction.

Given information:
- Entrance ticket to the park: $5 per person
- Ticket for each attraction: $2 for kids, $4 for parents

The family consists of:
- 4 children
- 2 parents
- 1 grandmother

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the entrance tickets.
Entrance tickets for 4 children: 4 × $5 = $20
Entrance tickets for 2 parents: 2 × $5 = $10
Entrance ticket for 1 grandmother: 1 × $5 = $5
Total cost of entrance tickets: $20 + $10 + $5 = $35

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the attraction tickets.
Attraction tickets for 4 children: 4 × $2 = $8
Attraction tickets for 2 parents: 2 × $4 = $8
Attraction ticket for 1 grandmother: 1 × $4 = $4
Total cost of attraction tickets: $8 + $8 + $4 = $20

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the family.
Total cost = Cost of entrance tickets + Cost of attraction tickets
Total cost = $35 + $20 = $55

Answer: $55
