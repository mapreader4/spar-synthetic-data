Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A bear eats up to 90 pounds of food per day
* Victor weighs 126 pounds
* We need to find how many "Victors" worth of food a bear would eat in 3 weeks

First, let's calculate how much food a bear would eat in 3 weeks:
* 90 pounds per day x 7 days per week x 3 weeks = 1,890 pounds of food

Now, let's calculate how many "Victors" that is:
* 1,890 pounds of food / 126 pounds per Victor = 15 Victors

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: 15
