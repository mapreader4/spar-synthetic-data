Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Steven fell down 3 times.
2) Stephanie had 13 more falls than Steven, so Stephanie fell down 3 + 13 = 16 times.
3) Sonya fell down 2 times less than half the number of times Stephanie fell.
4) Half the number of times Stephanie fell is 16 / 2 = 8.
5) Sonya fell down 8 - 2 = 6 times.
