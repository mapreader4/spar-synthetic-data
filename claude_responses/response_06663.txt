Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The horse is running at 20 feet per second.
2) The bullet fired from the gun flies at a speed of 400 feet per second.
3) If Wild Bill fires the gun in the same direction as the horse is running, the bullet's speed will be the sum of the horse's speed and the bullet's speed.
4) The bullet's speed in the same direction as the horse is running = 400 feet per second + 20 feet per second = 420 feet per second.
5) If Wild Bill fires the gun in the opposite direction of the horse's movement, the bullet's speed will be the difference between the horse's speed and the bullet's speed.
6) The bullet's speed in the opposite direction of the horse is running = 400 feet per second - 20 feet per second = 380 feet per second.
7) The difference in the bullet's speed between the two scenarios is:
420 feet per second - 380 feet per second = 40 feet per second.

Answer: 40 feet per second.
