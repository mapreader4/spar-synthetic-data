Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Doug has put out 20 fires for the week.
2) Kai has put out 3 times more fires than Doug, so Kai has put out 3 * 20 = 60 fires.
3) Eli has put out half the number of fires that Kai was able to, so Eli has put out 60 / 2 = 30 fires.
4) To find the total number of fires they have put out for the entire week, we add up the number of fires put out by each firefighter:
   Doug: 20 fires
   Kai: 60 fires
   Eli: 30 fires
   Total: 20 + 60 + 30 = 110 fires

Answer: 110
