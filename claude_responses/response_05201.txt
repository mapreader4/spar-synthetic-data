Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 train stations
* The stations are 2 hours apart from one another
* Kira travels from the first station to the third station
* Kira takes a 30 minute break at the second station

To calculate the total time Kira takes to travel between the first and third station, we need to:
1. Calculate the time it takes to travel from the first station to the second station
2. Add the 30 minute break at the second station
3. Calculate the time it takes to travel from the second station to the third station
4. Add the times from steps 1-3 to get the total time

Step 1: Time from first to second station = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Step 2: Break at second station = 30 minutes
Step 3: Time from second to third station = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Step 4: Total time = 120 + 30 + 120 = 270 minutes

Answer: 270
