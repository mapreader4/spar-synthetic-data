Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sally earned $1000 last month
* This month, she received a 10% raise
* To calculate the 10% raise:
    - 10% of $1000 = 0.10 * $1000 = $100
* So, her new monthly salary is $1000 + $100 = $1100
* To calculate the total amount she will make in the two months:
    - Last month: $1000
    - This month: $1100
    - Total: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Answer: $2100
