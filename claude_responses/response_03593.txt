Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pen costs $30
* Kate has money for a third of that amount
* To find how much money Kate has, we take one-third of $30:
* 1/3 of $30 = $10
* So Kate has $10 to put towards the pen
* To find how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has ($10) from the total cost of the pen ($30):
* $30 - $10 = $20

Answer: $20
