Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Prejean's speed was three-quarters that of Rickey's speed. This means that if Rickey took x minutes to finish the race, Prejean would take 4/3 * x minutes to finish the race.
2) The total time taken by both Prejean and Rickey was 70 minutes.
3) So we can write the equation:
x + 4/3 * x = 70
4) Solving for x, we get:
7/3 * x = 70
x = 30
Answer: 30 minutes
