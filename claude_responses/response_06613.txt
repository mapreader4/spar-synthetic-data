Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Curtis has a total of 325 chickens on his farm.
2) Out of the 325 chickens, 28 are roosters.
3) The remaining chickens are hens. So, the number of hens is 325 - 28 = 297.
4) Out of the 297 hens, 20 do not lay eggs.
5) The number of egg-laying hens is therefore 297 - 20 = 277.

Answer: 277
