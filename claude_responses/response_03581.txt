Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Darryl had to pay $3600 for the parts to construct the machine.
2) Darryl also had to pay $4500 for the patent he applied for once he built the machine.
3) The total cost for Darryl to design and build the machine is $3600 + $4500 = $8100.
4) The machine sells for $180 per unit.
5) To break even, Darryl needs to sell enough machines to cover the $8100 in costs.
6) To calculate the number of machines Darryl needs to sell, we divide the total cost ($8100) by the price per machine ($180):
8100 / 180 = 45

Answer: 45
