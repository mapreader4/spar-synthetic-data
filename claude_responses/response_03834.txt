Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Macy used 11 tokens, and each token gets you 15 pitches. So Macy had a total of 11 * 15 = 165 pitches.
2) Macy hit the ball 50 times, so she missed 165 - 50 = 115 pitches.
3) Piper used 17 tokens, and each token gets you 15 pitches. So Piper had a total of 17 * 15 = 255 pitches.
4) Piper hit the ball 55 times, so she missed 255 - 55 = 200 pitches.
5) The total number of pitches missed by Macy and Piper is 115 + 200 = 315.

Answer: 315
