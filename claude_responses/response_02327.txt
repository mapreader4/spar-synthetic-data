Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The adoption fee for the untrained dog is $150.
2. The training takes 12 weeks, and costs $250 per week.
   * 12 weeks x $250 per week = $3,000 for the training.
3. The certification costs $3,000.
   * However, John's insurance covers 90% of that cost.
   * 90% of $3,000 = $2,700 covered by insurance.
   * The remaining 10% of the certification cost is $300 out-of-pocket.

Now, let's add up the total out-of-pocket costs:
* Adoption fee: $150
* Training cost: $3,000
* Certification cost (after insurance): $300
* Total out-of-pocket cost: $150 + $3,000 + $300 = $3,450

Answer: $3,450
