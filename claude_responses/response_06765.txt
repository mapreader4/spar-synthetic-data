Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 5 frogs sitting on lily pads in the pond.
* Then, 3 more frogs climbed out of the water onto logs in the pond.
* So the total number of frogs on the lily pads and logs is 5 + 3 = 8 frogs.
* Additionally, 2 dozen (which is 24) baby frogs hopped onto a rock jutting out from the pond.
* So the total number of frogs Hunter saw in the pond is the 8 frogs on the lily pads and logs, plus the 24 baby frogs on the rock, which is 8 + 24 = 32 frogs.

Answer: 32
