Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Jennie can make 7 quilts with 21 yards of material.
2) This means that for every 7 quilts, she uses 21 yards of material.
3) We want to find how many yards of material are required to make 12 quilts.
4) To do this, we can set up a proportion:
7 quilts / 21 yards = 12 quilts / x yards
5) Cross-multiplying, we get:
7x = 21 * 12
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = (21 * 12) / 7
7) Simplifying, we get:
x = 36 yards

Answer: 36
