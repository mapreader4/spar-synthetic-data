Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In 2010, the Chicago Bulls won 70 games
* The Miami Heat won 5 more games than the Chicago Bulls
* To find the number of games the Miami Heat won, we add 5 to the number of games the Chicago Bulls won:
* 70 + 5 = 75 games
* Now, to find the total number of games won by the Bulls and the Heat, we add their individual game totals:
* 70 + 75 = 145 games

Answer: 145
