Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Viggo's age was 10 years more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2 years old.
* So, if the younger brother was 2 years old, Viggo's age would have been:
    - Twice the younger brother's age (2 x 2 = 4)
    - Plus 10 more years (4 + 10 = 14)
    - So Viggo's age when the younger brother was 2 was 14 years old.
* Now, the younger brother is currently 10 years old.
* So, Viggo's current age would be:
    - 14 years old (when the younger brother was 2)
    - Plus 8 years (since the younger brother is now 10)
    - So Viggo's current age is 14 + 8 = 22 years old.
* The sum of their ages is:
    - Viggo's age (22)
    - Plus the younger brother's age (10)
    - Answer: 22 + 10 = 32

Answer: 32
