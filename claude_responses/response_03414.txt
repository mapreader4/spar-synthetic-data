Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. John reels in 3 crab baskets a week.
2. Each basket holds 4 crabs.
3. He collects crabs twice a week.
4. Each crab sells for $3.

To calculate the total number of crabs he collects in a week:
* 3 baskets per collection x 4 crabs per basket = 12 crabs per collection
* 12 crabs per collection x 2 collections per week = 24 crabs per week

To calculate the total money he makes in a week:
* 24 crabs per week x $3 per crab = $72 per week

Answer: $72
