Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 10000 spectators in total.
2) 7000 of them were men.
3) The remaining spectators were either women or children.
4) The number of children was 5 times the number of women.
Let's call the number of women 'x'.
Then the number of children is 5x.
The total number of remaining spectators is 10000 - 7000 = 3000.
So we have the equation:
x + 5x = 3000
6x = 3000
x = 500
Therefore, the number of women is 500.
And the number of children is 5 times that, which is 5 * 500 = 2500.

Answer: 2500
