Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark does a gig every other day for 2 weeks
* Each gig, he plays 3 songs
* 2 of the songs are 5 minutes long
* The last song is twice as long, so it is 10 minutes long
* To calculate the total minutes played:
  * In 2 weeks, there are 14 days
  * Mark plays a gig every other day, so he plays 7 gigs in 2 weeks
  * For each gig, he plays 3 songs
  * 2 songs are 5 minutes long, so that's 10 minutes per gig
  * 1 song is 10 minutes long, so that's 10 minutes per gig
  * The total minutes per gig is 10 + 10 = 20 minutes
  * Over 7 gigs, the total minutes played is 7 * 20 = 140 minutes

Answer: 140
