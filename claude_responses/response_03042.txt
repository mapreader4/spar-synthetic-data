To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Andy needs to drive and then divide it by the time he wants to take to reach his destination.

Given information:
- The drive from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas is 420 miles.
- The drive from Las Vegas to Los Angeles is 273 miles.
- Andy wants to make the drive in 11 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy needs to drive.
Total distance = Distance from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas + Distance from Las Vegas to Los Angeles
Total distance = 420 miles + 273 miles = 693 miles

Step 2: Calculate the average minimum speed Andy needs to drive to reach Los Angeles in 11 hours.
Average minimum speed = Total distance / Time
Average minimum speed = 693 miles / 11 hours = 63 miles per hour

Answer: 63 miles per hour
