Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Laura bought 2 pairs of pants for $54 each
* So the total cost of the pants is 2 * $54 = $108
* She also bought 4 shirts for $33 each
* So the total cost of the shirts is 4 * $33 = $132
* The total cost of the pants and shirts is $108 + $132 = $240
* Laura gave the cashier $250
* To calculate the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:
* $250 - $240 = $10
