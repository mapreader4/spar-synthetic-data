Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have 3 bouquets of carnations with the following number of carnations in each:
   - Bouquet 1: 9 carnations
   - Bouquet 2: 14 carnations
   - Bouquet 3: 13 carnations
2) To find the average number of carnations, we need to add up the total number of carnations and divide by the number of bouquets.
3) The total number of carnations is 9 + 14 + 13 = 36 carnations.
4) There are 3 bouquets, so we divide the total number of carnations by 3 to get the average.
5) 36 carnations / 3 bouquets = 12 carnations per bouquet on average.

Answer: 12
