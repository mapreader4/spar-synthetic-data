Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mike bought 200 acres of land for $70 per acre.
2) The total cost of the land is 200 acres x $70 per acre = $14,000.
3) After development, he sold half of the acreage, which is 100 acres, for $200 per acre.
4) The total revenue from selling the 100 acres is 100 acres x $200 per acre = $20,000.
5) The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
6) Profit = $20,000 - $14,000 = $6,000.

Answer: $6,000
