Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cooper is building a brick fence around all four sides of his property
* Each of the four walls of the fence is 20 bricks long, 5 bricks high, and 2 bricks deep
* To calculate the total number of bricks needed, we need to find the total number of bricks in each wall, and then multiply that by the number of walls.

For each wall:
* The length is 20 bricks
* The height is 5 bricks
* The depth is 2 bricks
* So the total number of bricks per wall is 20 x 5 x 2 = 200 bricks

Now, since there are 4 walls, the total number of bricks needed is:
* 4 walls x 200 bricks per wall = 800 bricks

Answer: 800
