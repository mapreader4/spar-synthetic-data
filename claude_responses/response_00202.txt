Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Susie has $200 in her piggy bank.
2) She is going to put 20% more money into her piggy bank.
3) To calculate 20% of $200, we can multiply $200 by 0.20 (20% expressed as a decimal):
$200 x 0.20 = $40
4) So, Susie will be adding $40 to her piggy bank.
5) To calculate the total amount of money she will have in her piggy bank, we add the original $200 and the $40 she is adding:
$200 + $40 = $240

Answer: 240
