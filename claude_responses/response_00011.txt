Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95
* He has been saving up his money for the past 3 months
* He gets a $5 allowance a month
* He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel a driveway
* He mowed 4 lawns
* After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change

First, let's calculate how much money Tobias saved up over the 3 months:
* Allowance: $5 per month x 3 months = $15
* Mowing lawns: $15 per lawn x 4 lawns = $60
* Shoveling driveways: $7 per driveway x ? driveways = $7 x ? 

Now, we know that after buying the $95 shoes, he has $15 in change. So the total amount of money he had before buying the shoes was $95 + $15 = $110.

We can now set up an equation to solve for the number of driveways he shoveled:
* Total money = Allowance + Mowing + Shoveling
* $110 = $15 + $60 + $7 x ?
* $35 = $7 x ?
* ? = 5 driveways

Answer: 5 driveways
