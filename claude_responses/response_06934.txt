Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For the morning session:
* 25 students were registered
* 3 students were absent
* So, the number of students present in the morning session was 25 - 3 = 22 students

For the afternoon session:
* 24 students were registered
* 4 students were absent
* So, the number of students present in the afternoon session was 24 - 4 = 20 students

Now, to find the total number of students Mrs. McGillicuddy had over the two kindergarten sessions, we add the number of students present in the morning and afternoon sessions:
* 22 students (morning) + 20 students (afternoon) = 42 students

Answer: 42
