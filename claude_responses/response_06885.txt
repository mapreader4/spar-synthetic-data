Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Farrah ordered 4 boxes from Amazon
* Each box contains 20 matchboxes
* Each matchbox has 300 match sticks

To calculate the total number of match sticks, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of matchboxes Farrah ordered:
   * 4 boxes x 20 matchboxes per box = 80 matchboxes
2. Calculate the total number of match sticks in the 80 matchboxes:
   * 80 matchboxes x 300 match sticks per matchbox = 24,000 match sticks

Answer: 24,000
