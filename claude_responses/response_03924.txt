Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Luisa drives 10 miles to the grocery store, 6 miles to the mall, 5 miles to the pet store, then 9 miles back home.
2) The total distance of her trip is 10 + 6 + 5 + 9 = 30 miles.
3) One gallon of gas can be used to drive 15 miles.
4) Therefore, Luisa needs 30 / 15 = 2 gallons of gas for her entire trip.
5) One gallon of gas costs $3.50.
6) The total cost of the gas for Luisa's entire trip is 2 gallons x $3.50 per gallon = $7.00.
