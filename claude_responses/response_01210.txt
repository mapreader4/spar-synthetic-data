Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each turtle lays a clutch of 20 eggs
* 6 turtles are producing hatchlings
* 40% of the eggs successfully hatch

First, we need to find the total number of eggs laid by the 6 turtles:
* 6 turtles x 20 eggs per turtle = 120 eggs

Next, we need to find how many of those 120 eggs successfully hatch:
* 40% of 120 eggs = 0.4 x 120 = 48 eggs

Therefore, the 6 turtles produce 48 hatchlings.

Answer: 48
