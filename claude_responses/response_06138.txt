Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1. Heaven and her brother are given $100 in total by their father to buy school supplies.
2. Heaven buys:
   - 2 sharpeners at $5 each, so 2 x $5 = $10
   - 4 notebooks at $5 each, so 4 x $5 = $20
   - Total spent by Heaven = $10 + $20 = $30
3. The remaining amount after Heaven's purchases is $100 - $30 = $70.
4. Heaven's brother uses the remaining $70 to buy:
   - 10 erasers at $4 each, so 10 x $4 = $40
   - The remaining amount is $70 - $40 = $30
5. Therefore, Heaven's brother spent $30 on highlighters.

Answer: $30
