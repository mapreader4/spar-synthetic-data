Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Cindy tosses 5 dimes into the pond. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 5 dimes is 5 x 10 = 50 cents.
* Eric flips 3 quarters into the pond. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 3 quarters is 3 x 25 = 75 cents.
* Garrick throws in 8 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 8 nickels is 8 x 5 = 40 cents.
* Ivy drops 60 pennies in. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 60 pennies is 60 cents.
* Eric then pulls out a quarter, which is worth 25 cents.

To calculate the total amount of money put into the pond, we add up the amounts from Cindy, Eric, Garrick, and Ivy, then subtract the 25 cents that Eric pulled out:
* 50 cents + 75 cents + 40 cents + 60 cents - 25 cents = 200 cents

Answer: 200 cents
