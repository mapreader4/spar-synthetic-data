Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Miriam spent 30 minutes doing laundry
* She spent 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom
* She spent a certain amount of time cleaning her room
* She spent 40 minutes doing homework
* The total time spent on these tasks was 2 hours

To find the time spent cleaning her room, we need to subtract the time spent on the other tasks from the total time:
* Total time = 2 hours = 120 minutes
* Time spent on laundry = 30 minutes
* Time spent on bathroom cleaning = 15 minutes
* Time spent on homework = 40 minutes
* Time spent on cleaning room = Total time - (Time on laundry + Time on bathroom + Time on homework)
* Time spent on cleaning room = 120 minutes - (30 minutes + 15 minutes + 40 minutes)
* Time spent on cleaning room = 120 minutes - 85 minutes
* Time spent on cleaning room = 35 minutes

Answer: 35 minutes
