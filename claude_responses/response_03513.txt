Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Originally, it cost $200 to refill the tank.
2. James got an extra tank to double the fuel capacity. This means he now needs to refill two tanks.
3. The original cost of refilling one tank was $200.
4. Since he now needs to refill two tanks, the original cost is now $200 x 2 = $400.
5. Fuel prices have gone up by 20%. This means the new cost is 120% of the original cost.
6. To calculate the new cost, we take the original cost of $400 and multiply it by 120%: $400 x 1.20 = $480.

Answer: $480
