Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 8 jumbo scallops weigh 1 pound
* 1 pound of scallops costs $24.00
* Nate is pairing 2 scallops per person
* Nate is cooking for 8 people

First, we need to calculate how many scallops are needed for 8 people:
* 8 people x 2 scallops per person = 16 scallops

Next, we need to calculate how many pounds of scallops are needed:
* 16 scallops / 8 scallops per pound = 2 pounds

Finally, we can calculate the cost of the scallops:
* 2 pounds x $24.00 per pound = $48.00

Answer: $48.00
