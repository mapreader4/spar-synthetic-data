Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Pants:
   - Dennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants
   - Each pair of pants costs $110.00
   - There is a 30% discount on the pants
   - To calculate the discounted price of each pair of pants:
     - Original price: $110.00
     - Discount (30%): $110.00 * 0.30 = $33.00
     - Discounted price: $110.00 - $33.00 = $77.00
   - Total cost of 4 pairs of pants: 4 * $77.00 = $308.00

2. Socks:
   - Dennis wants to buy 2 pairs of socks
   - Each pair of socks costs $60.00
   - There is a 30% discount on the socks
   - To calculate the discounted price of each pair of socks:
     - Original price: $60.00
     - Discount (30%): $60.00 * 0.30 = $18.00
     - Discounted price: $60.00 - $18.00 = $42.00
   - Total cost of 2 pairs of socks: 2 * $42.00 = $84.00

3. Total cost:
   - Total cost of pants: $308.00
   - Total cost of socks: $84.00
   - Total cost of all items: $308.00 + $84.00 = $392.00

Answer: $392.00
