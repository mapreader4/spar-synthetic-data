Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The secretary has been working for 6 years.
2) The secretary's current salary is €10,000 per month.
3) The secretary has obtained a salary increase of 2%.
4) To calculate the new salary, we need to find 2% of the current salary and add it to the current salary.
5) 2% of €10,000 is 0.02 * €10,000 = €200.
6) Adding the increase of €200 to the current salary of €10,000, we get the new salary of €10,200 per month.

Answer: 10200
