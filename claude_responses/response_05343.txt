Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Gillian's usual phone bill is $50 per month.
2) The monthly bill increases by 10%.
3) To calculate the new monthly bill, we take the original bill of $50 and increase it by 10%:
   $50 + (10% of $50) = $50 + ($50 * 0.10) = $50 + $5 = $55
4) So Gillian's new monthly phone bill is $55.
5) To calculate the total phone bill for the entire next year, we multiply the new monthly bill of $55 by 12 months:
   $55 * 12 = $660

Answer: $660
