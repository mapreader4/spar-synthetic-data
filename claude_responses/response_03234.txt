Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Grandma left $124,600 in her will.
2) She gave half of it to her favorite grandchild, Shelby.
   - Half of $124,600 is $124,600 / 2 = $62,300.
3) The remaining amount is $124,600 - $62,300 = $62,300.
4) This remaining $62,300 was to be evenly divided among the remaining 10 grandchildren.
   - To find how much each of the remaining 10 grandchildren received, we divide $62,300 by 10.
   - $62,300 / 10 = $6,230.

Answer: $6,230.
