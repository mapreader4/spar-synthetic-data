Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that each watermelon weighs 23 pounds.
2) Farmer Kent is selling his special watermelons for $2 per pound.
3) We need to find out how much money he would make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight.
4) To do this, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 18 watermelons:
   - 18 watermelons x 23 pounds per watermelon = 414 pounds
5) Now we can calculate the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make:
   - 414 pounds x $2 per pound = $828

Answer: $828
