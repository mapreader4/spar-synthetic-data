Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The original recipe is for a 4-person cake and requires 2 eggs and 4 cups of milk.
2) Tyler wants to make a cake for 8 people, which is double the original recipe.
3) Since the original recipe requires 2 eggs for 4 people, to make a cake for 8 people, Tyler will need 2 x 2 = 4 eggs.
4) Tyler has 3 eggs in the fridge, so he needs to buy 4 - 3 = 1 more egg.
