Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kris can blow up 2 balloons per minute
* Her brother works twice as fast, so he can blow up 4 balloons per minute
* For the first 15 minutes:
    - Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute for 15 minutes, so that's 2 x 15 = 30 balloons
    - Her brother blows up 4 balloons per minute for 15 minutes, so that's 4 x 15 = 60 balloons
    - Total for the first 15 minutes: 30 + 60 = 90 balloons
* For the remaining 15 minutes:
    - Kris still blows up 2 balloons per minute for 15 minutes, so that's 2 x 15 = 30 balloons
    - Her brother now works at double speed, so he blows up 8 balloons per minute for 15 minutes, so that's 8 x 15 = 120 balloons
    - Total for the remaining 15 minutes: 30 + 120 = 150 balloons
* Total balloons blown up in 30 minutes:
    - 90 + 150 = 240 balloons

Answer: 240
