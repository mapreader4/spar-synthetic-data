Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The parking lot is 400 feet by 500 feet, which means the total area of the parking lot is 400 feet * 500 feet = 200,000 square feet.
2) However, only 80% of the parking lot is useable for parking. So, the useable area is 200,000 square feet * 0.8 = 160,000 square feet.
3) It takes 10 square feet to park a car. 
4) To find the number of cars that can be parked, we divide the useable area (160,000 square feet) by the area required for each car (10 square feet).
5) 160,000 square feet / 10 square feet per car = 16,000 cars.

Answer: 16,000
