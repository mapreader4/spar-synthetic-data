Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Elodie has 30 rats
2) Hunter has 10 rats less than Elodie, so Hunter has 20 rats
3) Kenia has three times as many rats as Hunter and Elodie together, which is 3 * (20 + 30) = 150 rats
4) The total number of pets the three have together is the sum of Elodie's rats, Hunter's rats, and Kenia's rats:
30 + 20 + 150 = 200

Answer: 200
