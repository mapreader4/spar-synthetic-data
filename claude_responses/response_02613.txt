Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony starts with $87
* He needs to buy:
  - Cheese, which costs $7 per pound
  - Beef, which costs $5 per pound
* After buying the beef and cheese, he has $61 left

To find the amount of cheese he bought, we can set up an equation:
* Let x = the number of pounds of cheese he bought
* Total cost of cheese = $7 * x
* Total cost of beef = $5 * (87 - 61 - 7x) / 5 = $5 * 5 = $25
* Total amount spent = $7x + $25
* Total amount spent = $87 - $61 = $26
* $7x + $25 = $26
* $7x = $1
* x = 1/7 = 0.14 pounds

Since we are looking for the number of pounds of cheese, and the answer must be an integer, we round down to 0 pounds.
