Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on the truck.
2) That means the total number of oranges on the truck is 10 * 30 = 300 oranges.
3) Out of the 300 oranges, 50 are rotten.
4) That leaves 300 - 50 = 250 good oranges.
5) 30 of the good oranges will be kept for making orange juice.
6) That leaves 250 - 30 = 220 oranges to be sold.

Answer: 220
