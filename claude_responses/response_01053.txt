Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jane reads twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening
* In the morning, she reads 5 pages
* In the evening, she reads 10 pages
* So in one day, she reads 5 + 10 = 15 pages
* She does this for a week, which is 7 days
* So the total number of pages she reads in a week is:
* 15 pages per day x 7 days = 105 pages

Answer: 105
