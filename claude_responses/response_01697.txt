Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Initially, there were $21 in the cookie jar.
2) Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar.
3) Martha spent half as much as Doris, which means she spent $3.
4) To calculate the amount of money left in the cookie jar, we need to subtract the amount spent by Doris and Martha from the initial amount in the cookie jar.
5) $21 - $6 (Doris) - $3 (Martha) = $12 left in the cookie jar.
