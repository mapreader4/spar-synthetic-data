Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A bag of a dozen apples costs $14
* Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis
* Brian has spent half of $10, which is $5, on bananas
* Brian left his house with $50
* Brian needs to pay $3.50 subway fare each way, which is $7 in total

First, let's calculate how much money Brian has left after his previous purchases:
* $50 - $10 (kiwis) - $5 (bananas) = $35 left

Now, let's calculate how many bags of apples Brian can buy with the remaining $35:
* $35 / $14 per bag = 2.5 bags
* Since we can only buy whole bags, the maximum number of bags Brian can buy is 2 bags

Finally, let's calculate the maximum number of apples Brian can buy:
* 2 bags x 12 apples per bag = 24 apples

Answer: 24
