Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total distance across the country is 8205 kilometers.
* On Monday, Amelia drove 907 kilometers.
* On Tuesday, Amelia drove 582 kilometers.
* To calculate the total distance Amelia has driven so far, we add the distances from Monday and Tuesday:
    - 907 km + 582 km = 1489 km
* To calculate the remaining distance Amelia has to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance across the country:
    - 8205 km - 1489 km = 6716 km

Answer: 6716 kilometers
