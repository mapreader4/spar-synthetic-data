Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wickham invites 30 people to the party.
2) Half of the guests bring a plus one, which means an additional 15 people will be attending.
3) In total, there will be 30 + 15 = 45 people attending the party.
4) For the 3-course meal, each guest will need 3 plates (one for each course).
5) Therefore, the total number of plates needed is 45 guests x 3 plates per guest = 135 plates.

Answer: 135
