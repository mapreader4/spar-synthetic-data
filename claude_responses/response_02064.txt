Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The price of the refrigerator is $4275.
2) The price of the washing machine is $1490 less than the price of the refrigerator.
3) To find the price of the washing machine, we subtract $1490 from the price of the refrigerator:
   $4275 - $1490 = $2785
4) To find the total price of the purchases, we add the price of the refrigerator and the price of the washing machine:
   $4275 + $2785 = $7060

Answer: $7060
