Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* From March to August, Sam made $460 doing 23 hours of yard work.
* This means he made $460 / 23 hours = $20 per hour.
* From September to February, Sam was only able to work for 8 hours.
* So, during this time period, he made 8 hours * $20 per hour = $160.
* In total, Sam has made $460 + $160 = $620.
* Sam needs to buy a video game console that costs $600.
* Sam has already spent $340 to fix his car.
* So, the amount Sam has left to save for the video game console is $600 - $620 + $340 = $320.
* Since Sam makes $20 per hour, he needs to work $320 / $20 per hour = 16 more hours to save up enough money to buy the video game console.

Answer: 16 hours
