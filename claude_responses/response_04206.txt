Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The puppy needs to eat 2 ounces of special dog food per day for the first 60 days of its life.
* After 60 days, the puppy needs to eat 4 ounces of special dog food per day until it is 1 year old.
* There are 16 ounces in a pound.
* The special dog food is sold in 5-pound bags.

First, let's calculate the total amount of special dog food needed for the first 60 days:
* 2 ounces per day x 60 days = 120 ounces

Next, let's calculate the total amount of special dog food needed from day 61 until the puppy is 1 year old (365 days):
* 4 ounces per day x 305 days = 1,220 ounces

The total amount of special dog food needed is:
* 120 ounces + 1,220 ounces = 1,340 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can calculate the total pounds of special dog food needed:
* 1,340 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 83.75 pounds

Finally, since the special dog food is sold in 5-pound bags, we can calculate the number of bags the family needs to buy:
* 83.75 pounds / 5 pounds per bag = 16.75 bags

Answer: 17 bags
