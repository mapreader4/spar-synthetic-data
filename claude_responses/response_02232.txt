Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

On Monday, Adam had 6 lessons of 30 minutes each. So, the total time spent at school on Monday was:
6 lessons x 30 minutes = 180 minutes

On Tuesday, Adam had 3 lessons of 1 hour each. So, the total time spent at school on Tuesday was:
3 lessons x 1 hour = 3 hours

On Wednesday, Adam spent twice as much time at school as on Tuesday. So, the total time spent at school on Wednesday was:
2 x 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we need to calculate the total time Adam spent at school during these 3 days:
Monday: 180 minutes = 3 hours
Tuesday: 3 hours
Wednesday: 6 hours

Total time spent at school = 3 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours = 12 hours

Answer: 12 hours
