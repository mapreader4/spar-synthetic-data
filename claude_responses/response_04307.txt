Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The building has 100 units total.
2) The building is 3/4 occupied for the whole year.
3) This means that 3/4 of the 100 units are occupied, which is 75 units.
4) Each resident pays a rent of $400 per month.
5) To calculate the total amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in a year, we need to multiply the number of occupied units (75) by the monthly rent ($400) and then multiply that by 12 months.
6) 75 units x $400 per month = $30,000 per month.
7) $30,000 per month x 12 months = $360,000 per year.

Answer: $360,000
