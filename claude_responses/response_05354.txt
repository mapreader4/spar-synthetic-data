Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Kelly harvested carrots from 3 different beds.
2) In the first bed, she pulled out 55 carrots.
3) In the second bed, she pulled out 101 carrots.
4) In the third bed, she pulled out 78 carrots.
5) To find the total number of carrots harvested, we add the carrots from each bed:
55 + 101 + 78 = 234 carrots
6) We are told that 6 carrots weigh 1 pound.
7) To find the total weight of the carrots, we divide the total number of carrots by 6:
234 carrots / 6 carrots per pound = 39 pounds
Answer: 39
