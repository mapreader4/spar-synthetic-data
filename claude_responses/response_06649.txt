Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Charlie can make 5350 steps while running on a 3-kilometer running field.
2) This means that for every 3 kilometers he runs, he makes 5350 steps.
3) During the running session, he runs around the field 2 1/2 times.
4) This means he runs a total distance of 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 kilometers.
5) Since he makes 5350 steps for every 3 kilometers, for 7.5 kilometers he will make:
(7.5 / 3) * 5350 = 13375 steps.

Answer: 13375
