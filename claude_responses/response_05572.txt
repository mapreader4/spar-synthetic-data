Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alicia received 10 presents in small boxes
* Alicia received 12 presents in medium boxes
* A third of all the presents Alicia received were in large boxes

To find the total number of presents Alicia received, we need to first find the number of presents in large boxes.

Since a third of all the presents were in large boxes, we can calculate the number of large box presents as follows:
* Total number of presents = 10 (small) + 12 (medium) + Large box presents
* Large box presents = 1/3 * Total number of presents

Substituting the known values, we get:
* Large box presents = 1/3 * (10 + 12 + Large box presents)
* Large box presents = 1/3 * (22 + Large box presents)
* 3 * Large box presents = 22 + Large box presents
* 2 * Large box presents = 22
* Large box presents = 11

Now we can calculate the total number of presents Alicia received:
* Total presents = 10 (small) + 12 (medium) + 11 (large)
* Total presents = 33

Answer: 33
