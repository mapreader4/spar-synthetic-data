Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary initially has 5 green crayons and 8 blue crayons.
2) She gives out 3 green crayons and 1 blue crayon to Becky.
3) To find the number of crayons Mary has left, we need to subtract the number of crayons she gave out from the initial number of crayons she had.
4) The number of green crayons she gave out is 3, so the number of green crayons she has left is 5 - 3 = 2.
5) The number of blue crayons she gave out is 1, so the number of blue crayons she has left is 8 - 1 = 7.
6) The total number of crayons Mary has left is the sum of the green crayons and the blue crayons: 2 + 7 = 9.
