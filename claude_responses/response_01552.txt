Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 180 people working for Lauryn's company
* There are 20 fewer men than women
* Let's represent the number of men as x and the number of women as x + 20
* Since the total number of people is 180, we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 20) = 180
* Simplifying this equation:
2x + 20 = 180
* Subtracting 20 from both sides:
2x = 160
* Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 80

Answer: 80
