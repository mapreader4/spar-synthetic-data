Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Grant has four times as many vacations as Kelvin has classes.
2) Kelvin has 90 classes.
3) To find the number of vacations Grant has, we multiply Kelvin's number of classes by 4:
   * 90 classes x 4 = 360 vacations
4) Now we can find the total number of vacations and classes that Grant and Kelvin have altogether:
   * Grant has 360 vacations
   * Kelvin has 90 classes
   * Total vacations and classes = 360 + 90 = 450

Answer: 450
