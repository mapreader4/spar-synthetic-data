Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The quilt dimensions are 7 feet by 8 feet.
2) To find the area of the quilt, we multiply the length and width:
   * Area = 7 feet x 8 feet = 56 square feet
3) The quilt costs $40 per square foot.
4) To find the total cost of the quilt, we multiply the area by the cost per square foot:
   * Total Cost = 56 square feet x $40 per square foot = $2,240

Answer: $2,240
