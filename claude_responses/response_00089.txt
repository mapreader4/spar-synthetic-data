Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Krystian borrows an average of 40 books every day
* Every Friday, his number of borrowed books is about 40% higher than the daily average
* The library is open from Monday to Friday

To calculate the number of books he borrows in a week, we need to find the number of books he borrows each day and then add them up.

* Monday to Thursday: 40 books per day
* Friday: 40 + (40 * 0.4) = 56 books

Now, we add up the number of books borrowed each day:
* Monday to Thursday: 4 * 40 = 160 books
* Friday: 56 books

Total number of books borrowed in a week:
* 160 + 56 = 216 books

Answer: 216
