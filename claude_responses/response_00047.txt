Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The file size is 90 megabytes.
2) The download rate is 5 megabytes per second for the first 60 megabytes.
3) The download rate is 10 megabytes per second for the remaining 30 megabytes.
4) To calculate the time for the first 60 megabytes:
   - 60 megabytes / 5 megabytes per second = 12 seconds
5) To calculate the time for the remaining 30 megabytes:
   - 30 megabytes / 10 megabytes per second = 3 seconds
6) The total time is the sum of the two:
   - 12 seconds + 3 seconds = 15 seconds
