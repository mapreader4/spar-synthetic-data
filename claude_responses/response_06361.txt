Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The teacher assigned a minimum of 25 pages of reading for homework.
2) Harrison read 10 more pages than assigned, so Harrison read 25 + 10 = 35 pages.
3) Pam read 15 more pages than Harrison, so Pam read 35 + 15 = 50 pages.
4) Sam read twice the amount of Pam, so Sam read 2 * 50 = 100 pages.

Answer: 100
