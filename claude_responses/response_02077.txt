Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Liz bought a recipe book that cost $6
* She bought a baking dish that cost twice as much as the recipe book, which is 2 x $6 = $12
* She bought 5 ingredients that cost $3 each, so 5 x $3 = $15
* She bought an apron that cost a dollar more than the recipe book, which is $6 + $1 = $7

Now, to calculate the total amount Liz spent, we add up all the costs:
* $6 + $12 + $15 + $7 = $40

Answer: $40
