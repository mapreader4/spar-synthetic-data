To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue for each company and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- Company A sells a big bottle of milk for $4.
- Company A sold 300 big bottles of milk.
- Company B sells a big bottle of milk for $3.5.
- Company B sold 350 big bottles of milk.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue for Company A.
Total revenue for Company A = Price per bottle × Number of bottles sold
Total revenue for Company A = $4 × 300 = $1,200

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue for Company B.
Total revenue for Company B = Price per bottle × Number of bottles sold
Total revenue for Company B = $3.5 × 350 = $1,225

Step 3: Find the difference in total revenue between the two companies.
Difference in total revenue = Total revenue for Company B - Total revenue for Company A
Difference in total revenue = $1,225 - $1,200 = $25

Therefore, Company B made $25 more than Company A.

Answer: $25
