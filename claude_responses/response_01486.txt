Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tammy gets a free haircut for every 14 haircuts she gets
* She has already gotten 5 free haircuts
* She is 5 haircuts away from another free one

To find the total number of haircuts she has gotten, we need to first find how many "sets" of 14 haircuts she has completed.

Since she is 5 haircuts away from another free one, that means she has completed (14 - 5) = 9 sets of 14 haircuts.
* 9 sets of 14 haircuts = 9 * 14 = 126 haircuts

Now, we add the 5 free haircuts she has already received:
* 126 haircuts + 5 free haircuts = 131 total haircuts

Answer: 131
