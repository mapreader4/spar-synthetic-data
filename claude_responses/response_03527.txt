Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marsha's first delivery is 10 miles
* Marsha's second delivery is 28 miles
* Marsha's third delivery is half of 28 miles, which is 14 miles
* So the total distance Marsha drove is 10 + 28 + 14 = 52 miles
* Marsha gets paid $104 for the day
* To calculate the amount she gets paid per mile, we divide the total pay by the total distance:
* $104 / 52 miles = $2 per mile
