Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Colton had 72 dolphin stickers to start with.
2) He gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends, so that's 4 x 3 = 12 stickers given away.
3) He then gave his friend Mandy 2 more than he gave his three friends total, which is 12 + 2 = 14 stickers.
4) He then gave Justin 10 less than Mandy, which is 14 - 10 = 4 stickers.
5) So in total, Colton gave away 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 stickers.
6) Therefore, the number of stickers Colton has left is 72 - 30 = 42 stickers.

Answer: 42
