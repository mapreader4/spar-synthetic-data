Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Drew's lawn is 22 feet from the house to the curb and 36 feet from side to side.
2) This means the total area of his lawn is 22 feet x 36 feet = 792 square feet.
3) One bag of grass seed covers 250 square feet of lawn.
4) Drew bought 4 bags of seed.
5) So the total area that the 4 bags of seed can cover is 4 x 250 = 1,000 square feet.
6) The area of Drew's lawn is 792 square feet.
7) Therefore, the leftover grass seed can cover an additional 1,000 - 792 = 208 square feet.

Answer: 208
