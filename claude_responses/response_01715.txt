Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeremy's uncle gave him $50 to spend on basketball equipment
* He bought:
  - 5 jerseys that cost $2 each
  - 1 basketball that cost $18
  - 1 pair of shorts that cost $8
* To calculate the total cost of the items he bought:
  - 5 jerseys x $2 each = $10
  - 1 basketball at $18
  - 1 pair of shorts at $8
  - Total cost = $10 + $18 + $8 = $36
* To calculate the amount of money Jeremy has left:
  - He was given $50 to spend
  - He spent $36
  - $50 - $36 = $14
