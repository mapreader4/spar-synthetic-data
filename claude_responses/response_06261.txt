Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Peter bought 2 pairs of pants and 5 shirts for a total of $62.
2) Jessica bought 2 shirts for a total of $20.
3) We know that each pair of pants and each shirt cost the same price, respectively.
4) Let's call the cost of a pair of pants 'x' and the cost of a shirt 'y'.
5) For Peter's purchase, we can write the equation: 2x + 5y = 62
6) For Jessica's purchase, we can write the equation: 2y = 20
7) Solving the second equation for y, we get y = 10.
8) Substituting y = 10 into the first equation, we get: 2x + 50 = 62
9) Solving for x, we get: 2x = 12, so x = 6.

Answer: 6
