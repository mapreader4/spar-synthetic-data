Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Billy has 4 horses
* Each horse eats 4 pounds of oats, twice a day
* We need to find the total amount of oats needed for 3 days

First, let's calculate the amount of oats needed per day:
* Each horse eats 4 pounds of oats, twice a day
* So each horse eats 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of oats per day
* With 4 horses, the total amount of oats needed per day is 4 x 8 = 32 pounds

Now, to find the total amount of oats needed for 3 days:
* 32 pounds per day x 3 days = 96 pounds

Answer: 96
