Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The number Armand's dad is thinking of, when multiplied by 3, is three less than twice 51.
2) Twice 51 is 102.
3) Three less than 102 is 99.
4) So the number Armand's dad is thinking of, when multiplied by 3, is 99.
5) To find the original number, we need to divide 99 by 3.
6) 99 / 3 = 33.

Answer: 33
