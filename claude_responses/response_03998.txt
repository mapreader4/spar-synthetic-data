Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tim buys 3 goats for $400 each.
   * Cost of 3 goats = 3 x $400 = $1,200

2) Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats.
   * Number of llamas = 2 x 3 = 6 llamas

3) Each llama costs 50% more than each goat.
   * Cost of each goat = $400
   * Cost of each llama = $400 + (50% of $400) = $400 + $200 = $600

4) Total cost of the llamas:
   * Cost of 6 llamas = 6 x $600 = $3,600

5) Total amount spent by Tim:
   * Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of llamas
   * Total cost = $1,200 + $3,600 = $4,800

Answer: $4,800
