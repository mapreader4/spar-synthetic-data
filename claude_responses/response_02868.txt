Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 8 red pens in Maria's desk drawer.
2) There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 + 10 = 18.
3) There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 + 7 = 15.
4) To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red, black, and blue pens:
8 + 18 + 15 = 41

Answer: 41
