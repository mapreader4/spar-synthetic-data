Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Suzanne and her husband each have 1 whole slice of french toast
* Her two daughters split 1 slice of french toast
* So, in total, they consume 3 slices of french toast per weekend
* There are 52 weeks in a year
* On weekends (Saturdays and Sundays), there are 104 days in a year
* Each loaf of bread has 12 slices
* To calculate the number of loaves of bread needed:
* Total slices of french toast consumed per year = 3 slices per weekend x 52 weeks = 156 slices
* Number of loaves of bread needed = 156 slices / 12 slices per loaf = 13 loaves

Answer: 13 loaves of bread
