Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Kayla and Kylie picked a total of 200 apples.
2) Kayla picked 1/4 of the apples that Kylie picked.
3) Let's call the number of apples Kylie picked as "x".
4) Since Kayla picked 1/4 of the apples that Kylie picked, Kayla picked 1/4 * x apples.
5) The total number of apples picked is 200, so we can write the equation:
   Kayla's apples + Kylie's apples = 200
   (1/4 * x) + x = 200
6) Solving for x, we get:
   (1/4 * x) + x = 200
   (5/4 * x) = 200
   x = 160
7) Since Kayla picked 1/4 of the apples that Kylie picked, and Kylie picked 160 apples, Kayla picked:
   1/4 * 160 = 40 apples.

Answer: 40
