Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Leonard is 4 years younger than Nina
2) Nina is half as old as Jerome
3) The sum of their ages is 36

Let's start by finding Jerome's age:
* If Nina is half as old as Jerome, then Jerome's age is 2 times Nina's age.
* Let's call Nina's age 'x'.
* Then Jerome's age is '2x'.

Now we can set up an equation to find the sum of their ages:
* Leonard's age = x - 4
* Nina's age = x
* Jerome's age = 2x
* Sum of their ages = (x - 4) + x + 2x = 36
* 4x - 4 = 36
* 4x = 40
* x = 10

So, Nina's age is 10.
Leonard's age is 10 - 4 = 6.
