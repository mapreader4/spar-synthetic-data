Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Pauline has a total of 125 matchbox cars
* 64% of them are regular cars
* 8% of them are trucks
* To find the number of convertibles, we need to subtract the number of regular cars and trucks from the total number of cars

First, let's find the number of regular cars:
* 64% of 125 = 0.64 * 125 = 80 regular cars

Next, let's find the number of trucks:
* 8% of 125 = 0.08 * 125 = 10 trucks

Now, we can find the number of convertibles by subtracting the regular cars and trucks from the total:
* 125 - 80 - 10 = 35 convertibles

Answer: 35
