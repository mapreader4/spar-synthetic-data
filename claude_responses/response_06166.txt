Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 3 baskets, each with 900 strawberries
* So the total number of strawberries was 3 * 900 = 2,700
* 2/9 of the strawberries were remaining
* This means that 7/9 of the strawberries were eaten
* Since there were two hedgehogs, they each ate half of the 7/9 of the strawberries
* So each hedgehog ate 7/18 of the total strawberries

Now, let's calculate the total number of strawberries each hedgehog ate:
* 7/18 of 2,700 = (7/18) * 2,700 = 1,050

Answer: 1,050
