Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jake originally owed $100.
2) He paid $40 before agreeing to work off the rest.
3) So the remaining debt he needs to work off is $100 - $40 = $60.
4) He is paid $15 per hour for the work.
5) To calculate the number of hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining debt by the hourly rate:
$60 / $15 per hour = 4 hours.
