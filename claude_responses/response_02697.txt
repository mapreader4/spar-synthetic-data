Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Shelly made keychains for 6 friends in classes
* She made keychains for half that number from after-school clubs, which is 3 friends
* In total, she made keychains for 6 + 3 = 9 friends
* Each keychain takes 12 inches of thread to braid
* To find the total amount of thread needed, we multiply the number of friends (9) by the amount of thread per keychain (12 inches)
* 9 friends x 12 inches per keychain = 108 inches of thread

Answer: 108
