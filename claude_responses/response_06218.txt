Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Blake bought 4 lollipops and 6 packs of chocolate.
2) Each lollipop costs $2.
3) A pack of chocolate costs the same as four lollipops, so each pack of chocolate costs $8.
4) The total cost of the 4 lollipops is 4 x $2 = $8.
5) The total cost of the 6 packs of chocolate is 6 x $8 = $48.
6) The total cost of all the items is $8 + $48 = $56.
7) Blake gave the cashier 6 $10 bills, which is a total of $60.
8) The change Blake will get back is $60 - $56 = $4.
