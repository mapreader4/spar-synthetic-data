Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The pie was originally sliced into 8 pieces.
* Nancy gave 1/2 of the pie to Joe and Darcy, which is 4 slices (1/2 of 8 = 4).
* Nancy then gave 1/4 of the pie to Carl, which is 2 slices (1/4 of 8 = 2).
* So in total, Nancy gave away 4 + 2 = 6 slices of the pie.
* The original pie had 8 slices, and Nancy gave away 6 slices, so the number of slices left is 8 - 6 = 2 slices.
