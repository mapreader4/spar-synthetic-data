Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Blake spent $40 on oranges, $50 on apples, and $60 on mangoes.
2) To calculate the total amount he spent, we add these three amounts together:
$40 + $50 + $60 = $150
3) Blake had $300 to start with.
4) To calculate the change he was given, we subtract the total amount he spent ($150) from the amount he had ($300):
$300 - $150 = $150
Answer: 150
