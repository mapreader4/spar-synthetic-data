Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Erwin eats 2 chocolates on weekdays
* Erwin eats 1 chocolate on weekends
* He ate 24 chocolates in total

To find the number of weeks it took to finish all the chocolate, we need to find the number of weekdays and weekends in the time period.

Let's assume the number of weeks is x.
* On weekdays, he eats 2 chocolates per day, and there are 5 weekdays per week.
* So on weekdays, he eats 2 * 5 * x = 10x chocolates.
* On weekends, he eats 1 chocolate per day, and there are 2 weekend days per week.
* So on weekends, he eats 1 * 2 * x = 2x chocolates.
* The total number of chocolates he eats is 10x + 2x = 12x.

We know that he ate 24 chocolates in total, so:
* 12x = 24
* x = 2

Therefore, it took Erwin 2 weeks to finish all the chocolate.
