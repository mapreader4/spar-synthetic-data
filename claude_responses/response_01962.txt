Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Philip makes 2 paintings per day
* He already has 20 paintings
* We want to know how many paintings he will have after 30 days

To calculate the total number of paintings he will have after 30 days, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of paintings he will make in 30 days
2. Add that to the 20 paintings he already has

Step 1: Calculating the number of paintings he will make in 30 days
* He makes 2 paintings per day
* So in 30 days, he will make 2 paintings x 30 days = 60 paintings

Step 2: Adding the 60 paintings he will make to the 20 he already has
* 20 paintings + 60 paintings = 80 paintings

Answer: 80 paintings
