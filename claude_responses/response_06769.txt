Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ken caught twice as many fish as Kendra, so if Kendra caught 30 fish, then Ken caught 2 * 30 = 60 fish.
2) Ken released 3 fish back into the lake, so the number of fish Ken brought home is 60 - 3 = 57 fish.
3) Kendra caught 30 fish and did not release any, so the number of fish Kendra brought home is 30 fish.
4) The total number of fish that Ken and Kendra brought home is the sum of the fish they each brought home:
57 + 30 = 87 fish.

Answer: 87
