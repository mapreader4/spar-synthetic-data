Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Stephen has a total of 110 ants in his ant farm.
2) Half of the ants are worker ants, so the number of worker ants is 110 / 2 = 55.
3) 20 percent of the worker ants are male, so the number of male worker ants is 55 * 0.20 = 11.
4) The number of female worker ants is the total number of worker ants minus the number of male worker ants.
5) The number of female worker ants is 55 - 11 = 44.

Answer: 44
