Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Janina spends $30 each day for rent
* Janina uses $12 worth of supplies daily to run her pancake stand
* Total daily expenses = $30 (rent) + $12 (supplies) = $42
* Janina sells each pancake for $2
* To cover her daily expenses, Janina needs to sell enough pancakes to make at least $42

To calculate the number of pancakes Janina needs to sell each day, we divide the total daily expenses by the price per pancake:
* $42 (total daily expenses) / $2 (price per pancake) = 21 pancakes

Answer: 21
