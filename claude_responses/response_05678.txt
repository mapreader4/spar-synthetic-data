Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The train has some number of passenger cars, let's call this number x.
2) The number of cargo cars is equal to half the number of passenger cars plus three. So the number of cargo cars is (x/2) + 3.
3) The total number of cars in the train is 71, counting the engine and caboose.
4) So the total number of cars is x + (x/2) + 3 + 2 = 71.
5) Solving this equation, we get:
x + (x/2) + 5 = 71
3x/2 + 5 = 71
3x = 132
x = 44

Therefore, the number of passenger cars in the train is 44.

Answer: 44
