Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Justine had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey
* Justine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona
* Bailey gave 2 rubber bands each to Justine and Ylona, leaving him with 8 rubber bands
* Let's call the number of rubber bands Ylona had in the beginning as "x"
* Since Justine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona, Justine had "x-2" rubber bands
* Since Justine had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, Bailey had "x-2-10 = x-12" rubber bands
* Bailey gave 2 rubber bands each to Justine and Ylona, so he was left with 8 rubber bands
* Therefore, Bailey originally had 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 rubber bands
* We know that Bailey had "x-12" rubber bands, so "x-12 = 12"
* Solving for x, we get x = 24

Answer: 24
