Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The company was originally producing 7000 toilet paper per day.
2) During the coronavirus outbreak, the company had to ramp up its production three times more to cover the increased demand.
3) To calculate the new production rate, we multiply the original production of 7000 by 3:
7000 x 3 = 21,000 toilet paper per day
4) Now we need to calculate the total toilet paper production during the month of March 2020. There are 31 days in March.
5) So the total toilet paper production would be:
21,000 toilet paper per day x 31 days = 651,000 toilet paper

Answer: 651,000
