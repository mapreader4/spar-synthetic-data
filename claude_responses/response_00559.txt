Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Luna's monthly food budget is 60% of her house rental budget.
   * Let's call the house rental budget "x".
   * Then the food budget is 0.6x.

2. The total budget of house rental and food budget is $240.
   * So, x + 0.6x = $240
   * 1.6x = $240
   * x = $150 (house rental budget)

3. The food budget is 60% of the house rental budget.
   * Food budget = 0.6 * $150 = $90

4. The phone bill budget is 10% of the food budget.
   * Phone bill budget = 0.1 * $90 = $9

5. To find the total monthly budget, we add up the house rental, food, and phone bill budgets.
   * Total monthly budget = $150 + $90 + $9 = $249

Answer: $249
