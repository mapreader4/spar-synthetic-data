Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each breakfast plate has 2 eggs
* Each breakfast plate has twice as many bacon strips as eggs
* 14 customers ordered breakfast plates

First, let's calculate the number of eggs needed:
* 14 customers x 2 eggs per plate = 28 eggs

Next, let's calculate the number of bacon strips needed:
* Each plate has twice as many bacon strips as eggs
* 2 x 28 eggs = 56 bacon strips

Therefore, the cook needs to fry 56 bacon strips.

Answer: 56
