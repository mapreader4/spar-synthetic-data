Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mel is three years younger than Katherine.
2) When Katherine is two dozen years old, that means she is 24 years old.
3) Since Mel is three years younger than Katherine, we can subtract 3 from Katherine's age to find Mel's age.
4) 24 years old (Katherine) - 3 years = 21 years old (Mel).

Answer: 21
