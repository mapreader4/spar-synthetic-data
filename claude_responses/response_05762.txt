Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The nurse must check 26 Kindergarteners, 19 first graders, 20 second graders, and 25 third graders.
* Each check takes 2 minutes.
* To calculate the total time, we need to add up the time for each group:
  - 26 Kindergarteners x 2 minutes = 52 minutes
  - 19 first graders x 2 minutes = 38 minutes
  - 20 second graders x 2 minutes = 40 minutes
  - 25 third graders x 2 minutes = 50 minutes
* Adding these up, the total time is:
  - 52 + 38 + 40 + 50 = 180 minutes
* To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
  - 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours

Answer: 3 hours
