Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Rose had 10 kilograms of rice initially.
2) In the morning, she cooked 9/10 kilograms of rice.
   * 9/10 kilograms = 9 kilograms
3) After the morning cooking, she had 10 kilograms - 9 kilograms = 1 kilogram of rice remaining.
4) In the evening, she cooked 1/4 of the remaining 1 kilogram.
   * 1/4 kilogram = 0.25 kilograms
5) After the evening cooking, she had 1 kilogram - 0.25 kilograms = 0.75 kilograms of rice remaining.
6) 0.75 kilograms = 750 grams.

Answer: 750
