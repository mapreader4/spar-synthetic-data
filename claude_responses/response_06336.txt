Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Marco has a total of 500 cards on hand.
2) One-fourth of these cards are duplicates, which means 1/4 of 500 = 125 cards are duplicates.
3) Marco decides to trade one-fifth of the duplicate cards for new cards.
4) One-fifth of 125 duplicate cards is 125 / 5 = 25 cards.
5) Therefore, Marco got 25 new cards from his friend Josh.

Answer: 25
