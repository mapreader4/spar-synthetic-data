Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Preston charges $5 for each sandwich
* Abra Company ordered 18 sandwiches
* The total cost of the sandwiches is 18 x $5 = $90
* Preston also charges a $20 delivery fee
* The total cost before the tip is $90 + $20 = $110
* Abra Company tips Preston 10% of the total cost
* 10% of $110 is 0.1 x $110 = $11
* The total amount Preston received is the total cost plus the tip
* $110 + $11 = $121

Answer: $121
