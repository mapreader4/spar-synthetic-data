Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Malou got 91, 90, and 92 in her three quizzes.
2) To find the average, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of quizzes.
3) The total of the three scores is 91 + 90 + 92 = 273.
4) The number of quizzes is 3.
5) To find the average, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes: 273 / 3 = 91.

Answer: 91
