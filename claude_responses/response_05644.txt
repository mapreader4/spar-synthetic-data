Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Andrew has 2 appointments that are each 3 hours long
* This means he spends 6 hours in appointments
* He has an 8-hour workday
* So, he has 8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours left to stamp permit applications
* He can stamp 50 permit applications per hour
* In the 2 hours he has left, he can stamp:
   * 50 permits per hour x 2 hours = 100 permits
* Therefore, the total number of permits he stamps today is:
   * Answer: 100 permits
