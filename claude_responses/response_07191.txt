Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) On Monday, Sally picked 30 seashells.
2) On Tuesday, she picked half as many seashells as she did on Monday. That means she picked 30 / 2 = 15 seashells on Tuesday.
3) In total, Sally picked 30 + 15 = 45 seashells.
4) Each seashell can be sold for $1.20.
5) To calculate the total money she can make, we multiply the total number of seashells (45) by the price per seashell ($1.20).

Answer: 45 * $1.20 = $54
