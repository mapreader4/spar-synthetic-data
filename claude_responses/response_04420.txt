Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Steve has 2 boxes of pencils, with 12 pencils in each box. So, the total number of pencils Steve has is 2 * 12 = 24 pencils.
2) Steve gave Matt 3 more pencils than he gave to Lauren. So, if he gave 6 pencils to Lauren, he gave Matt 6 + 3 = 9 pencils.
3) Now, we need to find how many pencils Steve has left. We can do this by subtracting the number of pencils he gave to Lauren and Matt from the total number of pencils he had.
4) The number of pencils he gave to Lauren and Matt is 6 + 9 = 15 pencils.
5) The total number of pencils he had was 24, so the number of pencils he has left is 24 - 15 = 9 pencils.
