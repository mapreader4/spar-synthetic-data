Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The city's bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day.
2) We want to find how many people the bus system carries for 13 weeks.
3) There are 7 days in a week, so in 13 weeks there are 13 * 7 = 91 days.
4) To find the total number of people carried in 13 weeks, we multiply the number of people carried per day (1,200,000) by the number of days (91).
5) 1,200,000 people per day * 91 days = 109,200,000 people.

Answer: 109,200,000
