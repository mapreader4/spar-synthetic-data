Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Darlene's car gets 20 miles/gallon.
2) Martha's car gets half as many miles per gallon as Darlene's car. 
   - This means Martha's car gets 20 / 2 = 10 miles/gallon.
3) The trip is 300 miles.
4) To calculate how many gallons Martha's car requires, we divide the total distance by the miles per gallon:
   - 300 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 30 gallons.

Answer: 30
