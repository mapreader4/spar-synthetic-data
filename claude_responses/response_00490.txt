Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given the perimeter of a triangle, which is 160 cm.
2) We are also given the lengths of two of the sides, which are 40 cm and 50 cm.
3) To find the length of the third side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
4) Plugging in the values we know, we get:
160 cm = 40 cm + 50 cm + Side 3
5) Solving for Side 3, we get:
Side 3 = 160 cm - 40 cm - 50 cm
Side 3 = 70 cm

Answer: 70 cm
