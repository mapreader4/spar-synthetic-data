Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 6 times as many lab coats as uniforms in the lab.
2) The number of lab techs is half of the number of uniforms.
3) There are 12 uniforms in the lab.
4) Since the number of lab techs is half the number of uniforms, and there are 12 uniforms, the number of lab techs is 12 / 2 = 6.
5) If there are 6 times as many lab coats as uniforms, and there are 12 uniforms, then the number of lab coats is 6 * 12 = 72.
6) The lab techs share the coats and uniforms equally among them, so each lab tech gets 72 / 6 = 12 coats and 12 / 6 = 2 uniforms.

Answer: Each lab tech gets 12 coats and 2 uniforms.
