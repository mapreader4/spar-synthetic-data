Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* During the first wave, the number of coronavirus cases was 300 infections per day.
* During the second wave, the number of cases increased by four times more per day due to a new coronavirus variant.
* To calculate the number of cases per day during the second wave, we multiply the first wave cases by 4:
  * 300 infections per day x 4 = 1,200 infections per day during the second wave.
* The question asks for the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks.
* There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
* To calculate the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks, we multiply the daily infections by the number of days:
  * 1,200 infections per day x 14 days = 16,800 total infections during the second wave in 2 weeks.

Answer: 16,800
