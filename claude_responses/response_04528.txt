Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The football team has 16 players
* Each player needs:
  - A $25 jersey
  - A $15.20 pair of shorts
  - A $6.80 pair of socks
* To calculate the total cost for all the players:
  - Jersey cost: 16 players x $25 per jersey = $400
  - Shorts cost: 16 players x $15.20 per pair = $243.20
  - Socks cost: 16 players x $6.80 per pair = $108.80
* To get the total cost, we add up the costs for each item:
  - Total cost = $400 + $243.20 + $108.80 = $752

Answer: 752
