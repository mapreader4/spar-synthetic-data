Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Gretchen spends 6 hours working at her desk
* That's 6 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes of sitting
* The guideline states that you should spend 10 minutes walking for every 90 minutes of sitting
* So, for every 90 minutes of sitting, you should spend 10 minutes walking
* To calculate the walking time, we need to divide the total sitting time (360 minutes) by 90 minutes
* 360 minutes / 90 minutes = 4 
* Since each 90 minutes of sitting requires 10 minutes of walking, 4 sets of 90 minutes requires 4 x 10 minutes = 40 minutes of walking

Answer: 40 minutes
