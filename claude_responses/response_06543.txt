Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Orbius-5, there are 250 days per year
* Each year is equally divided into 5 seasons
* The astronaut stays on Orbius-5 for 3 seasons

To find the number of days the astronaut will spend on Orbius-5, we need to first find the length of each season:
* Since there are 250 days per year, and 5 seasons per year, each season is 250 / 5 = 50 days long.

Now, we can calculate the number of days the astronaut will spend on Orbius-5:
* The astronaut stays for 3 seasons
* Each season is 50 days long
* Therefore, the total number of days the astronaut will spend on Orbius-5 is 3 * 50 = 150 days

Answer: 150
