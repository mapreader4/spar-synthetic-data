Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Tonya has $150.00 on her credit card.
2) If she leaves any balance on her card at the end of the month, she is charged 20% interest.
3) Tonya makes a $50.00 payment on her card.
4) To calculate the new balance, we first need to subtract the $50.00 payment from the original $150.00 balance.
5) $150.00 - $50.00 = $100.00
6) Since Tonya is charged 20% interest on any remaining balance, we need to calculate the interest.
7) 20% of $100.00 = 0.20 * $100.00 = $20.00
8) The new balance is the remaining $100.00 plus the $20.00 interest charge.
9) $100.00 + $20.00 = $120.00

Answer: $120
