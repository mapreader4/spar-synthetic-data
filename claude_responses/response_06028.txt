Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bethany rides for 1 hour after school on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
* That's 3 days per week, and 1 hour per day, so that's 3 hours per week.
* Over 2 weeks, that's 3 hours x 2 weeks = 6 hours.
* On Tuesday and Thursday, she rides for 30 minutes each day.
* That's 30 minutes x 2 days = 1 hour per week.
* Over 2 weeks, that's 1 hour x 2 weeks = 2 hours.
* On Saturdays, she rides for 2 hours.
* That's 2 hours x 2 Saturdays (over 2 weeks) = 4 hours.
* Adding up all the hours:
  * 6 hours (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
  * 2 hours (Tuesday, Thursday)
  * 4 hours (Saturdays)
* The total hours Bethany rode over the 2 week period is:
Answer: 12 hours
