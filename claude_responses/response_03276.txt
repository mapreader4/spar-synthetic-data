Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Let's call the fastest speed of the rabbit 'x'.
2) We are told that if we take the fastest speed of the rabbit, double it, add 4, and then double it again, we get 188.
3) Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
2 * (2 * x + 4) = 188
4) Simplifying this equation:
4 * x + 8 = 188
5) Subtracting 8 from both sides:
4 * x = 180
6) Dividing both sides by 4:
x = 45
Therefore, the fastest speed of the rabbit is 45.
Answer: 45
