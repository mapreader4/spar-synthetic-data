Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bucket C has 9 pieces of fruit
* Bucket B has 3 more pieces of fruit than Bucket C
* So, Bucket B has 9 + 3 = 12 pieces of fruit
* Bucket A has 4 more pieces of fruit than Bucket B
* So, Bucket A has 12 + 4 = 16 pieces of fruit
* To find the total number of pieces of fruit in all 3 buckets, we add the amounts in each bucket:
* Bucket A: 16 pieces
* Bucket B: 12 pieces 
* Bucket C: 9 pieces
* Total = 16 + 12 + 9 = 37 pieces of fruit

Answer: 37
