Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of a spiral notebook is $15.
2) The cost of a personal planner is $10.
3) We need to buy 4 spiral notebooks and 8 personal planners.
4) The total cost without any discount would be:
   - 4 spiral notebooks x $15 = $60
   - 8 personal planners x $10 = $80
   - Total cost = $60 + $80 = $140
5) The discount is 20%, so we need to calculate 20% of the total cost:
   - 20% of $140 = 0.2 x $140 = $28
6) The total cost with the 20% discount is $140 - $28 = $112.

Answer: 112
