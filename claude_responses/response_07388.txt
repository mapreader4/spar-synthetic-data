Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Yella's computer usage last week was 91 hours.
2) This week, she plans to use the computer 8 hours a day.
3) There are 7 days in a week.
4) So her planned computer usage for this week is 8 hours per day x 7 days = 56 hours.
5) To find the difference, we subtract the planned usage this week from the usage last week:
91 hours - 56 hours = 35 hours.

Answer: 35 hours.
