Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Geordie drives his car to work 3 times a week and his motorcycle 2 times a week.
2. The toll for the car is $12.50 per trip, and the toll for the motorcycle is $7 per trip.
3. The commute to work is 14 miles, and the commute back is also 14 miles, so the total distance traveled per day is 28 miles.
4. Geordie's car and motorcycle both get 35 miles per gallon of gas.
5. Gas costs $3.75 per gallon.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the week:

Car Toll:
3 trips per week x $12.50 per trip = $37.50

Motorcycle Toll:
2 trips per week x $7 per trip = $14

Car Gas:
28 miles per day x 3 days per week = 84 miles per week
84 miles per week / 35 miles per gallon = 2.4 gallons per week
2.4 gallons per week x $3.75 per gallon = $9

Motorcycle Gas:
28 miles per day x 2 days per week = 56 miles per week
56 miles per week / 35 miles per gallon = 1.6 gallons per week
1.6 gallons per week x $3.75 per gallon = $6

Total Cost:
Car Toll + Motorcycle Toll + Car Gas + Motorcycle Gas
= $37.50 + $14 + $9 + $6
= $66.50

Answer: $66.50
