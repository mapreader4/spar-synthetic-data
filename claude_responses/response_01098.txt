Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeremy buys 30 watermelons
* He eats 3 watermelons per week
* He gives 2 watermelons to his dad per week
* So, the total number of watermelons consumed per week is:
    - 3 watermelons eaten by Jeremy
    - 2 watermelons given to his dad
    - Total: 3 + 2 = 5 watermelons per week
* To find how many weeks the watermelons will last, we divide the total number of watermelons (30) by the number of watermelons consumed per week (5):
    - 30 watermelons / 5 watermelons per week = 6 weeks

Answer: 6
