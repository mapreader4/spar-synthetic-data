Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jason bought 4 dozen cupcakes
* 1 dozen = 12 cupcakes
* So, 4 dozen cupcakes = 4 x 12 = 48 cupcakes
* Jason plans to give 3 cupcakes to each of his cousins
* To find the number of cousins, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes (48) by the number of cupcakes given to each cousin (3)
* 48 cupcakes / 3 cupcakes per cousin = 16 cousins

Answer: 16
