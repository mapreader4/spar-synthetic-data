Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James gets 3 parking tickets.
2) The first 2 tickets cost $150 each.
3) The third ticket costs 1/3 as much as one of the first 2 tickets.
   * 1/3 of $150 = $50
   * So the third ticket costs $50.
4) The total cost of the 3 tickets is:
   * 2 x $150 = $300
   * 1 x $50 = $50
   * Total = $300 + $50 = $350
5) James' roommate agrees to pay half the cost.
   * Half of $350 = $175
6) James has to pay the other half of the cost.
   * $350 - $175 = $175
7) James had $500 in the bank.
   * $500 - $175 = $325

Answer: $325
