Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Anna has 3 times as many toys as Mandy
* Anna has 2 fewer toys than Amanda
* The total number of toys between the three of them is 142

Let's start by representing the number of toys each person has:
* Mandy has x toys
* Anna has 3x toys
* Amanda has 3x + 2 toys

We know that the total number of toys is 142, so we can set up an equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 2) = 142

Simplifying the equation:
7x + 2 = 142
7x = 140
x = 20

Therefore, Mandy has 20 toys.

Answer: 20
