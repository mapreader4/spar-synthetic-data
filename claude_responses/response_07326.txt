Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jason has a moray eel that eats 20 guppies a day.
2) Jason also has 5 betta fish, and each betta fish eats 7 guppies a day.
3) To calculate the total number of guppies the betta fish eat per day, we multiply the number of betta fish (5) by the number of guppies each betta fish eats per day (7):
5 betta fish x 7 guppies per betta fish = 35 guppies per day
4) To calculate the total number of guppies Jason needs to buy per day, we add the number of guppies the moray eel eats (20) and the number of guppies the betta fish eat (35):
20 guppies + 35 guppies = 55 guppies per day
Answer: 55
