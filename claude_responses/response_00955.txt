Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mr. Williams bought 10 gallons of juice.
2) Each gallon has 10 cups.
3) So the total number of cups of juice bought is 10 gallons x 10 cups/gallon = 100 cups.
4) At the party, 5 cups of juice were left.
5) To find the number of cups of juice that were drunk, we subtract the number of cups left from the total number of cups bought.
6) 100 cups - 5 cups = 95 cups.

Answer: 95
