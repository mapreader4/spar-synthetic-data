Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The ratio of blue, green, and white paint is 1 : 2 : 5
* Andy is using 6 gallons of green paint
* Since the ratio of green to the other colors is 2, we can use this to find the amount of blue and white paint
* If Andy is using 2 parts green, then he must be using 1 part blue and 5 parts white
* Since he is using 6 gallons of green, we can use the ratio to find the amount of blue and white:
* Blue: 1 part out of 8 total parts, so 6 / 8 = 3/4 gallons of blue
* White: 5 parts out of 8 total parts, so 6 * 5/2 = 15 gallons of white

Adding up the amounts of each color:
* Blue: 3/4 gallons
* Green: 6 gallons 
* White: 15 gallons
* Total: 3/4 + 6 + 15 = 21 3/4 gallons

Answer: 22 gallons
