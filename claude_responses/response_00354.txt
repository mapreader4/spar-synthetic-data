Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Seth bought some boxes of oranges.
2) He gave one box to his mother.
3) He then gave away half of the remaining boxes.
4) After giving away half the remaining boxes, he has 4 boxes left.

Let's use variables to represent the unknown quantities:
* Let x = the number of boxes Seth bought originally.
* After giving one box to his mother, he has (x-1) boxes remaining.
* He then gave away half of the remaining boxes, so he gave away (x-1)/2 boxes.
* He has 4 boxes left, so we can set up the equation:
(x-1) - (x-1)/2 = 4
* Solving this equation:
(x-1) - (x-1)/2 = 4
(x-1) - 0.5(x-1) = 4
0.5(x-1) = 4
x-1 = 8
x = 9

Therefore, Seth bought 9 boxes of oranges in the first place.

Answer: 9
