Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sam is twice as old as Sue
* Kendra is 3 times as old as Sam
* Kendra is currently 18 years old

First, let's find Sam's age:
* Kendra is 3 times as old as Sam
* Kendra is 18 years old
* So, Sam is 18 / 3 = 6 years old

Now, let's find Sue's age:
* Sam is twice as old as Sue
* Sam is 6 years old
* So, Sue is 6 / 2 = 3 years old

In 3 years, their ages will be:
* Kendra: 18 + 3 = 21
* Sam: 6 + 3 = 9
* Sue: 3 + 3 = 6

The total age in 3 years will be:
* Kendra (21) + Sam (9) + Sue (6) = 36

Answer: 36
