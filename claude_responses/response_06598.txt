Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ariel has 45 fish in total
* 2/3 of the fish are male
* To find the number of male fish, we take 2/3 of the total number of fish:
    * 2/3 of 45 = (2/3) * 45 = 30 male fish
* To find the number of female fish, we need to subtract the number of male fish from the total number of fish:
    * Total fish - Male fish = Female fish
    * 45 - 30 = 15 female fish

Answer: 15
