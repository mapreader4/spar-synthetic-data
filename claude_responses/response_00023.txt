Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ann bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each
* So the total cost of the shorts is 5 * $7 = $35
* Ann also bought 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each
* So the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $10 = $20
* The total amount Ann spent is $75
* We know the total cost of the shorts and shoes is $35 + $20 = $55
* So the remaining amount spent is $75 - $55 = $20
* This remaining $20 was spent on 4 tops, all at the same price
* To find the cost of each top, we divide $20 by 4
* Answer: $5
