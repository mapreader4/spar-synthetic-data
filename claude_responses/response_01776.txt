Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The class needs to average at least 75% on the final exam to have a pizza party.
* There are 30 people in the class.
* The average score before William took the test was 74%.
* We need to find the score William needs to get in order for the class average to be at least 75%.

To calculate this, we can use the following formula:
(Total points of the class) / (Number of students) = 75%

We know the total points of the class before William took the test is:
30 students * 74% = 2,220 points

Now, we need to find the total points needed for the class to average 75%:
30 students * 75% = 2,250 points

The difference between the total points needed and the total points before William took the test is:
2,250 points - 2,220 points = 30 points

Since there are 30 students in the class, William needs to score 30 points to make up the difference and bring the class average to 75%.
