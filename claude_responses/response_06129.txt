Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Scott has 7 pairs of shoes.
2) Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott. 
   * So, Anthony has 3 x 7 = 21 pairs of shoes.
3) Jim has 2 less pairs of shoes than Anthony.
   * So, Jim has 21 - 2 = 19 pairs of shoes.
4) To find how many more pairs of shoes Anthony has compared to Jim, we subtract Jim's pairs from Anthony's pairs.
   * Anthony has 21 pairs, and Jim has 19 pairs.
   * 21 - 19 = 2

Answer: 2
