Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Monday, Iggy runs 3 miles
* On Tuesday, Iggy runs 4 miles
* On Wednesday, Iggy runs 6 miles
* On Thursday, Iggy runs 8 miles
* On Friday, Iggy runs 3 miles

We know that Iggy runs at a pace of 1 mile in 10 minutes.

To calculate the total time spent running, we need to add up the time for each day:
* Monday: 3 miles x 10 minutes/mile = 30 minutes
* Tuesday: 4 miles x 10 minutes/mile = 40 minutes
* Wednesday: 6 miles x 10 minutes/mile = 60 minutes
* Thursday: 8 miles x 10 minutes/mile = 80 minutes
* Friday: 3 miles x 10 minutes/mile = 30 minutes

Now we add up the total minutes:
* 30 + 40 + 60 + 80 + 30 = 240 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes/hour:
* 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Answer: 4 hours
