Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The three friends ate a total of 8 pounds of fruit
* 1 pound = 16 ounces
* Mario had 8 ounces of oranges
* Lydia ate 24 ounces of apples
* Nicolai ate peaches

To find how many pounds of peaches Nicolai ate, we need to first find the total amount of fruit eaten by Mario and Lydia, and then subtract that from the total of 8 pounds.

Mario's 8 ounces of oranges = 8 ounces
Lydia's 24 ounces of apples = 24 ounces
Total fruit eaten by Mario and Lydia = 8 + 24 = 32 ounces

Now we convert the total fruit eaten by Mario and Lydia from ounces to pounds:
32 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 2 pounds

The total fruit eaten by all three friends was 8 pounds.
So the amount of fruit eaten by Nicolai must be:
8 pounds - 2 pounds = 6 pounds

Answer: 6 pounds
