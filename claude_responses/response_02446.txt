Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob can skip a rock 12 times
* Jim can skip a rock 15 times
* They each skipped 10 rocks

To find the total number of skips, we need to calculate the number of skips for Bob and Jim separately, and then add them together.

For Bob:
* Bob skipped 10 rocks
* Each rock was skipped 12 times
* So, Bob's total skips = 10 rocks x 12 skips per rock = 120 skips

For Jim:
* Jim skipped 10 rocks
* Each rock was skipped 15 times
* So, Jim's total skips = 10 rocks x 15 skips per rock = 150 skips

Now, to find the total number of skips:
* Total skips = Bob's skips + Jim's skips
* Total skips = 120 + 150 = 270 skips

Answer: 270
