Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Walter works 5 days a week
2) He earns $5 per hour
3) He can only work 4 hours a day
4) He allocates 3/4 of his weekly earnings for his schooling

To calculate his weekly earnings:
* He works 5 days a week
* He works 4 hours per day
* So, he works 5 x 4 = 20 hours per week
* At $5 per hour, his weekly earnings are 20 x $5 = $100

Now, to calculate how much he allocates for school:
* He allocates 3/4 of his weekly earnings for his schooling
* 3/4 of $100 is 3 x $25 = $75

Therefore, the amount Walter allocates for school is:
Answer: $75
