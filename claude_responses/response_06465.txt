Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On the first day, 26 cm of rain fell.
* On the second day, 34 cm of rain fell.
* On the third day, 12 cm less than the second day fell, which means 34 - 12 = 22 cm of rain fell.
* The total rainfall for the first three days is 26 + 34 + 22 = 82 cm.
* The average rainfall for the first three days of May is usually 140 cm.
* To find how much less it is raining this year than average, we subtract the actual rainfall from the average rainfall:
* 140 cm - 82 cm = 58 cm

Answer: 58 cm
