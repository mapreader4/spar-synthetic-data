Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James won a money prize at a charity raffle.
2) He donated half of his winnings back to the charity.
3) He then spent $2 on a hot dog to celebrate his win.
4) He had $55 left over.

To find the amount he won, we can work backwards:
* He had $55 left over after donating half and spending $2.
* So, before spending the $2 on the hot dog, he had $57 left over.
* Since he donated half of his winnings, the amount he won was twice the $57 he had left over, which is $114.

Answer: $114
