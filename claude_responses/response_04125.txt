Okay, let's break this down step by step:
1) Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks.
2) Joey spent half as much time (that Ethan spent learning the tricks) learning to swim.
3) Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation.

First, let's find out how long Ethan spent learning the 12 fencing tricks.
* Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of this time.
* Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation, which is 9 days.
* Therefore, 3/4ths of the time Ethan spent learning the tricks is 9 days.
* So the total time Ethan spent learning the tricks is 9 days / 3/4 = 12 days.

Now, we can find out how long Joey spent learning to swim.
* Joey spent half as much time as Ethan spent learning the tricks.
* Ethan spent 12 days learning the tricks.
* Therefore, Joey spent 12 days / 2 = 6 days learning to swim.

Answer: 6 days
