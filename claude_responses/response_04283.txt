Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eddie can bake 3 pies per day
* His sister can bake 6 pies per day
* His mother can bake 8 pies per day
* They need to bake for 7 days

To calculate the total number of pies they can bake in 7 days, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of pies Eddie can bake in 7 days:
   * Eddie can bake 3 pies per day
   * In 7 days, he can bake 3 x 7 = 21 pies
2. Calculate the number of pies his sister can bake in 7 days:
   * His sister can bake 6 pies per day
   * In 7 days, she can bake 6 x 7 = 42 pies
3. Calculate the number of pies his mother can bake in 7 days:
   * His mother can bake 8 pies per day
   * In 7 days, she can bake 8 x 7 = 56 pies
4. Add up the total number of pies they can bake in 7 days:
   * Total pies = 21 + 42 + 56 = 119

Answer: 119
