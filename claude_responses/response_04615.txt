Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 6 female members in the Math club
* There are two times as many males as females
* To find the number of male members, we multiply the number of female members by 2:
* 6 female members x 2 = 12 male members
* To find the total number of members in the Math club, we add the number of female members and the number of male members:
* 6 female members + 12 male members = 18 total members

Answer: 18
