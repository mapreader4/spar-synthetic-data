Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 3 bicycles, each with 2 wheels, so the total number of wheels for the bicycles is 3 * 2 = 6 wheels.
2) There are 4 tricycles, each with 3 wheels, so the total number of wheels for the tricycles is 4 * 3 = 12 wheels.
3) There are 7 unicycles, each with 1 wheel, so the total number of wheels for the unicycles is 7 * 1 = 7 wheels.
4) To find the total number of wheels, we add the wheels for the bicycles, tricycles, and unicycles:
6 + 12 + 7 = 25 wheels.

Answer: 25
