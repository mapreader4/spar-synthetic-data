Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know that 35% of the books are intended for children.
2) We also know that 104 of the books are for adults.
3) Let's call the total number of books in the library 'x'.
4) Since 35% of the books are for children, the number of children's books is 0.35x.
5) The number of adult books is 0.65x (since the remaining 65% are for adults).
6) We know that the number of adult books is 104, so 0.65x = 104.
7) Solving for x, we get x = 104 / 0.65 = 160.

Answer: 160
