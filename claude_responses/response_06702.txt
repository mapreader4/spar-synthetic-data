Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 100 people in attendance at the school dance.
2) 10% of the attendees were school faculty and staff. 10% of 100 is 10, so there were 10 faculty and staff members.
3) The remaining attendees were students. 100 - 10 = 90 students.
4) Of the 90 student attendees, two-thirds were girls. Two-thirds of 90 is 60, so there were 60 girls.
5) The remaining students must have been boys. 90 - 60 = 30, so there were 30 boys.

Answer: 30
