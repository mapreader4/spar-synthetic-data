Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Elle practices piano for 30 minutes each day from Monday to Friday.
* That's 5 days of 30 minutes each, so that's 5 x 30 minutes = 150 minutes of practice during the weekdays.
* On Saturday, she practices three times as much as on a weekday, which is 3 x 30 minutes = 90 minutes.
* There is no practice on Sunday.
* To calculate the total time spent practicing piano each week, we add the weekday practice time and the Saturday practice time:
* 150 minutes + 90 minutes = 240 minutes.
* To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour:
* 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours.

Answer: 4 hours.
