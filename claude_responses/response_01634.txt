Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Alexa sells lemonade for $2 per cup
* She spent $20 on ingredients
* She wants to make a profit of $80

To calculate the number of cups she needs to sell, we need to find the total revenue she needs to generate to make a profit of $80.

Total revenue needed = Total cost + Desired profit
Total revenue needed = $20 + $80 = $100

Now, we can calculate the number of cups she needs to sell:
* Revenue per cup = $2
* Total revenue needed = $100
* Number of cups needed = Total revenue needed / Revenue per cup
* Number of cups needed = $100 / $2 = 50 cups

Answer: 50
