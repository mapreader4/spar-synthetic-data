Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* To make one batch of yogurt, the company needs:
  - 10 liters of milk at $1.5 per liter
  - 3 kilograms of fruit at $2 per kilogram
* So the cost of one batch of yogurt is:
  - Cost of milk: 10 liters x $1.5 per liter = $15
  - Cost of fruit: 3 kilograms x $2 per kilogram = $6
  - Total cost of one batch = $15 + $6 = $21
* To produce three batches of yogurt, the total cost would be:
  - 3 batches x $21 per batch = $63

Answer: $63
