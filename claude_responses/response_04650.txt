Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* On Saturday, Sally eats 2 sandwiches
* Each sandwich uses 2 pieces of bread
* So on Saturday, Sally eats 2 sandwiches x 2 pieces of bread per sandwich = 4 pieces of bread

* On Sunday, Sally eats 1 sandwich
* Each sandwich uses 2 pieces of bread
* So on Sunday, Sally eats 1 sandwich x 2 pieces of bread per sandwich = 2 pieces of bread

* To find the total pieces of bread Sally eats across Saturday and Sunday, we add the pieces of bread from each day:
* 4 pieces of bread (Saturday) + 2 pieces of bread (Sunday) = 6 pieces of bread
