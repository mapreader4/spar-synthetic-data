Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Walter fell from the eighth platform of the scaffolding
* He fell 4 meters before passing David
* He fell an additional three more times that depth before hitting the ground
* The platforms are evenly spaced out in height

First, let's calculate the total depth Walter fell:
* 4 meters + (3 x 4 meters) = 16 meters

Now, since the platforms are evenly spaced, we can divide the total depth by the number of platforms to get the height of each platform:
* 16 meters / 8 platforms = 2 meters per platform

So, David must have been on the platform that was 4 meters below the eighth platform, which is the fourth platform.
