Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that the sum of the three numbers is 500.
2) We are also given that the first number is 200.
3) The value of the second number is twice the value of the third number.
4) Let's call the third number x.
5) Then the second number is 2x.
6) We know that the sum of the three numbers is 500, so we can write the equation:
200 + 2x + x = 500
7) Simplifying this equation, we get:
200 + 3x = 500
8) Subtracting 200 from both sides, we get:
3x = 300
9) Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 100
Answer: 100
