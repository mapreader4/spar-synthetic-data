Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farmer has 1 hog and 6 piglets, for a total of 7 animals
* Each animal costs $10 per month to feed
* The farmer sells 3 pigs after 12 months and the remaining 3 pigs after 16 months

First, let's calculate the cost of feeding the 3 pigs sold after 12 months:
* 3 pigs x $10 per month x 12 months = $360

Next, let's calculate the cost of feeding the 3 pigs sold after 16 months:
* 3 pigs x $10 per month x 16 months = $480

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 6 pigs:
* 3 pigs x $300 = $900
* 3 pigs x $300 = $900
* Total revenue = $900 + $900 = $1,800

Finally, let's calculate the total profit:
* Total revenue = $1,800
* Total cost of feeding = $360 + $480 = $840
* Total profit = $1,800 - $840 = $960

Answer: $960
