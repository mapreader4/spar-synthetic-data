Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 82 students currently
* There are 2 students for each computer
* So, the number of computers is 82 / 2 = 41 computers
* Now, there are 16 more students, so the total number of students is 82 + 16 = 98 students
* To maintain the ratio of 2 students per computer, the number of computers needed is 98 / 2 = 49 computers

Answer: 49
