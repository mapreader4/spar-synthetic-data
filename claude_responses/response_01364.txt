Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Gina is taking 14 credits, and each credit costs $450.
   * Total cost of credits = 14 credits x $450 per credit = $6,300

2. Gina has to pay $120 for each of her 5 textbooks.
   * Total cost of textbooks = 5 textbooks x $120 per textbook = $600

3. Gina also has to pay a $200 facilities fee.

4. To calculate the total amount Gina will spend, we add up the costs:
   * Total cost = Cost of credits + Cost of textbooks + Facilities fee
   * Total cost = $6,300 + $600 + $200 = $7,100

Answer: $7,100
