Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Martha's daily allowance is $12
* She decides to save half of this amount every day, which is $6
* In the first week, there are 7 days
* On 6 of those days, she saved $6 each day, which is 6 x $6 = $36
* On the one day when she saved only a quarter of the amount, she saved $3 (a quarter of $12)
* So the total amount she saved in the first week is $36 + $3 = $39

Answer: $39
