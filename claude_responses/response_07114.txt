Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John bought 3 barbells
* He gave $850 and received $40 in change
* To find the cost of each barbell, we need to calculate the total cost of the 3 barbells

First, let's find the total cost of the 3 barbells:
* Total cost = Amount given - Change received
* Total cost = $850 - $40 = $810

Now, to find the cost of each barbell, we divide the total cost by the number of barbells:
* Cost per barbell = Total cost / Number of barbells
* Cost per barbell = $810 / 3 = $270

Therefore, the cost of each barbell is $270.

Answer: 270
