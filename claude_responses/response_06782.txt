Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Hendricks bought the guitar for $200.
2) The price Hendricks paid is 20% less than what Gerald paid.
3) To find the amount Gerald paid, we need to find the original price before the 20% discount.
4) The formula for finding the original price before a discount is: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Rate)
5) In this case, the Discounted Price is $200 and the Discount Rate is 20% or 0.20.
6) Plugging these values into the formula: Original Price = $200 / (1 - 0.20) = $200 / 0.80 = $250.

Answer: $250
