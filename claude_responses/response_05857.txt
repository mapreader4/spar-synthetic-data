Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ella eats 20 pounds of food each day
* Ella's dog eats 4 pounds of food for every 1 pound of food that Ella eats
* We want to find the total amount of food eaten by Ella and her dog in 10 days

First, let's calculate how much food Ella eats in 10 days:
* Ella eats 20 pounds of food per day
* In 10 days, Ella eats 20 pounds x 10 days = 200 pounds of food

Now, let's calculate how much food Ella's dog eats in 10 days:
* Ella's dog eats 4 pounds of food for every 1 pound of food that Ella eats
* Since Ella eats 200 pounds of food in 10 days, her dog eats 4 x 200 = 800 pounds of food

Finally, to get the total amount of food eaten by Ella and her dog in 10 days, we add the amounts together:
* Total food eaten = Ella's food + Dog's food
* Total food eaten = 200 pounds + 800 pounds = 1000 pounds

Answer: 1000
