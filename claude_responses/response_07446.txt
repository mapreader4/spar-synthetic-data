Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The ratio of male to female students is 3:2, which means there are 600 male students and 400 female students.
2) 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, which means 400 male students like to play basketball.
3) 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball, which means 80 female students like to play basketball.
4) The total number of students who like to play basketball is 400 + 80 = 480.
5) The total number of students in the school is 1000.
6) The number of students who do not like to play basketball is 1000 - 480 = 520.
7) The percent of the population of the school who do not like to play basketball is (520/1000) * 100 = 52%.

Answer: 52
