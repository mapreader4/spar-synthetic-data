Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brayden and Gavin scored 7 touchdowns
* Each touchdown is worth 7 points
* So Brayden and Gavin's total points = 7 touchdowns x 7 points per touchdown = 49 points

* Cole and Freddy's team scored 9 touchdowns
* Each touchdown is worth 7 points
* So Cole and Freddy's total points = 9 touchdowns x 7 points per touchdown = 63 points

* To find the difference in points between the two teams, we subtract Brayden and Gavin's points from Cole and Freddy's points:
* 63 points - 49 points = 14 points

Answer: 14
