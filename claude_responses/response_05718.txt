Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tony made 1 sandwich per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday)
* Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread
* So for the 5 days, Tony used 5 x 2 = 10 slices of bread
* On Saturday, Tony made 2 sandwiches
* Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread
* So on Saturday, Tony used 2 x 2 = 4 slices of bread
* In total, Tony used 10 + 4 = 14 slices of bread
* He started with a 22-slice loaf
* So the number of slices of bread left is 22 - 14 = 8
