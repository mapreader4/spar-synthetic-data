Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Darwin started with $600.
2) He spent 1/3 of $600 on gas. 1/3 of $600 is $200, so he spent $200 on gas.
3) After spending $200 on gas, he had $600 - $200 = $400 left.
4) He then spent 1/4 of the remaining $400 on food. 1/4 of $400 is $100, so he spent $100 on food.
5) After spending $100 on food, he had $400 - $100 = $300 left.

Answer: $300
