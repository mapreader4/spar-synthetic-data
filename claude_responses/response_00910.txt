Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John buys 1/2 gallon jugs of cold brew coffee every 4 days
* 1 gallon = 4 cups
* So, 1/2 gallon = 2 cups
* Since he buys the 1/2 gallon jugs every 4 days, he gets 2 cups of coffee every 4 days
* To find how many cups of coffee he drinks per day, we divide the 2 cups by 4 days:
* 2 cups / 4 days = 0.5 cups per day

Answer: 0.5 cups
