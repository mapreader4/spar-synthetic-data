Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 2 adults and 4 children in Everlee's family
* There are a total of 120 cookies in the cookie jar
* The adults eat 1/3 of the cookies
* To find how many cookies the adults eat:
  * 1/3 of 120 cookies = 120 * 1/3 = 40 cookies
* So the adults eat 40 cookies
* The remaining cookies are given to the 4 children to divide equally
* To find how many cookies the children get:
  * Total cookies remaining = 120 - 40 = 80 cookies
  * 80 cookies divided equally among 4 children = 80 / 4 = 20 cookies per child

Answer: 20 cookies
