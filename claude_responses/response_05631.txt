Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kim originally takes 4 classes
* Each class lasts 2 hours
* So the total hours of classes per day is:
    - 4 classes x 2 hours per class = 8 hours
* Kim then drops 1 class
* So the new total hours of classes per day is:
    - 3 classes x 2 hours per class = 6 hours

Answer: 6 hours
