Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total check amount is $200
* Mark wants to tip the server 20% of the check
* To calculate the 20% tip, we take 20% of $200:
* 20% of $200 = 0.20 x $200 = $40
* So the tip amount is $40
* Mark's friend agrees to kick in $10
* Therefore, the amount Mark should add is the total tip ($40) minus the amount his friend is contributing ($10)
* $40 - $10 = $30

Answer: $30
