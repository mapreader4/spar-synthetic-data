Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that for Miles, 1 inch equals 5 pages. So, if his collection is 240 inches tall, then the number of pages in his collection is:
240 inches x 5 pages/inch = 1,200 pages
2) We are also given that for Daphne, 1 inch equals 50 pages. So, if her collection is 25 inches tall, then the number of pages in her collection is:
25 inches x 50 pages/inch = 1,250 pages
3) Therefore, the longest collection is Daphne's, with 1,250 pages.

Answer: 1,250
