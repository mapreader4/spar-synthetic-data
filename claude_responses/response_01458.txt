Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The appetizer costs $10.
2. They ordered 4 entrees that cost $20 each, so the total cost of the entrees is 4 x $20 = $80.
3. The total cost of the food before the tip is $10 (appetizer) + $80 (entrees) = $90.
4. They are tipping 20% of the total cost, which means the tip is 0.20 x $90 = $18.
5. The total amount they spend at the restaurant is the cost of the food ($90) plus the tip ($18), which is $90 + $18 = $108.

Answer: 108
