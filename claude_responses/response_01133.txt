Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Marcus has 100 balloons, and each balloon holds 3 ounces of water.
2) To calculate the total amount of water needed, we multiply the number of balloons by the amount of water per balloon:
100 balloons x 3 ounces per balloon = 300 ounces of water needed.
3) Marcus can buy 50 ounces of water for $2.5 per bottle.
4) To calculate the total cost of the water, we divide the total amount of water needed (300 ounces) by the amount of water per bottle (50 ounces), and then multiply that by the cost per bottle ($2.5):
(300 ounces / 50 ounces per bottle) x $2.5 per bottle = $15 total cost of water.
5) Marcus walks into the store with 2 $10 bills, which is a total of $20.
6) To calculate the change he will have after buying the water, we subtract the total cost of the water ($15) from the amount he walked in with ($20):
$20 - $15 = $5 change.
