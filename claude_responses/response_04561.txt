Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jack has $26
* Ben has $9 more than Jack, so Ben has $26 + $9 = $35
* Eric has $10 less than Ben, so Eric has $35 - $10 = $25

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money that Eric, Ben, and Jack have:
* Eric has $25
* Ben has $35
* Jack has $26
* Total = $25 + $35 + $26 = $86

Answer: $86
