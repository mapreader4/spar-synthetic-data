Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tina wins her first 10 fights.
2) She then wins 5 more fights, so her total wins at this point is 10 + 5 = 15.
3) She then loses her first fight, so her total losses is 1.
4) She then doubles her number of wins, which is 15 * 2 = 30 wins.
5) She then loses again, so her total losses is now 2.
6) To calculate the difference between her wins and losses, we take her total wins (30) and subtract her total losses (2).
