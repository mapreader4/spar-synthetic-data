Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Katy brought 3 bags of 5-pound flour, so Katy brought 3 x 5 = 15 pounds of flour.
* Wendi brought twice as much flour as Katy, so Wendi brought 2 x 15 = 30 pounds of flour.
* Carrie brought 5 pounds less than the amount of flour Wendi brought, so Carrie brought 30 - 5 = 25 pounds of flour.
* To find how much more flour Carrie brought than Katy, we subtract Katy's flour from Carrie's flour: 25 - 15 = 10 pounds.
* To convert this to ounces, we multiply 10 pounds by 16 ounces per pound: 10 x 16 = 160 ounces.

Answer: 160 ounces
