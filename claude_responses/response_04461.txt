Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ms. Hatcher teaches 20 third-graders.
2) The number of fourth-graders is twice the number of third-graders, so that's 2 x 20 = 40 fourth-graders.
3) The fifth-grade class has half as many students as the number of third-graders, so that's 1/2 x 20 = 10 fifth-graders.
4) To find the total number of students Ms. Hatcher taught for the day, we add up the number of third-graders, fourth-graders, and fifth-graders:
20 third-graders + 40 fourth-graders + 10 fifth-graders = 70 students.

Answer: 70
