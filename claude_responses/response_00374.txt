Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 50 buyers the day before yesterday
* Yesterday, there were half the number of buyers as the day before, which means there were 25 buyers yesterday
* Today, there are 40 more buyers than yesterday, which means there are 25 + 40 = 65 buyers today
* Nobody visited the store on more than one day, so the total number of buyers who've visited the store in the three days is:
* Day before yesterday: 50 buyers
* Yesterday: 25 buyers
* Today: 65 buyers
* Total: 50 + 25 + 65 = 140 buyers

Answer: 140
