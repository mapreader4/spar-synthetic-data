Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mandy researched 42 med schools
* She applied to 1/3 of the schools she researched
* To find 1/3 of 42, we divide 42 by 3:
   * 42 รท 3 = 14
* So Mandy applied to 14 schools
* She got into half of the schools where she applied
* To find half of 14, we divide 14 by 2:
   * 14 รท 2 = 7
