Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Michael's father dug a hole at a rate of 4 feet per hour.
2) The father took 400 hours to dig his hole.
3) Therefore, the depth of the father's hole is 4 feet per hour * 400 hours = 1,600 feet.
4) Michael wants to dig a hole that is 400 feet less deep than twice the depth of his father's hole.
5) Twice the depth of the father's hole is 2 * 1,600 feet = 3,200 feet.
6) 400 feet less than 3,200 feet is 3,200 feet - 400 feet = 2,800 feet.
7) Michael will be working at the same rate as his father, which is 4 feet per hour.
8) To find the number of hours it will take Michael to dig a 2,800 foot hole, we divide 2,800 feet by 4 feet per hour.
9) 2,800 feet / 4 feet per hour = 700 hours.

Answer: 700 hours.
