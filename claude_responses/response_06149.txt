Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that a bag of chips weighs 20 ounces, and Jasmine buys 6 bags of chips.
2) So the total weight of the chips is 6 bags x 20 ounces per bag = 120 ounces.
3) We are also given that a tin of cookies weighs 9 ounces, and Jasmine buys 4 times as many tins of cookies as bags of chips.
4) So Jasmine buys 4 x 6 = 24 tins of cookies.
5) The total weight of the cookies is 24 tins x 9 ounces per tin = 216 ounces.
6) The total weight of the chips and cookies is 120 ounces + 216 ounces = 336 ounces.
7) To convert to pounds, we divide by 16 ounces per pound: 336 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 21 pounds.

Answer: 21 pounds.
