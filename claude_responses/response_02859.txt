Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Allen ordered 5 boxes of pizza, each costing $7.
2) The total cost of the pizza order is: 5 boxes x $7 per box = $35.
3) The tip he gave is 1/7 of the total cost, which is $35 / 7 = $5.
4) The total amount he paid is the cost of the pizza ($35) plus the tip ($5), which is $35 + $5 = $40.
5) Allen gave the delivery man $100.
6) The change he received is the amount he gave ($100) minus the total amount he paid ($40), which is $100 - $40 = $60.

Answer: $60
