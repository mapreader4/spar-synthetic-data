Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bill amount is not given, but we know that the 15% tip was $42.
* To find the 15% tip amount, we can use the formula:
Tip amount = Tip percentage x Bill amount
$42 = 0.15 x Bill amount
Bill amount = $42 / 0.15 = $280
* Now, we want to find the 20% tip amount. We can use the same formula:
Tip amount = Tip percentage x Bill amount
20% tip amount = 0.20 x $280 = $56

Answer: $56
