Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Olivia gave William 10 napkins
* Amelia gave William twice the number of napkins that Olivia gave him
* So, Amelia gave William 2 x 10 = 20 napkins
* William had 15 napkins before
* Now, we add the napkins Olivia and Amelia gave him:
* 15 (original napkins) + 10 (from Olivia) + 20 (from Amelia) = 45 napkins

Answer: 45
