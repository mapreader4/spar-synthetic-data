Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The car traveled 180 miles in 4 hours
* This means the car's average speed is 180 miles / 4 hours = 45 miles per hour
* The question asks how many miles the car will travel in the next 3 hours
* To calculate this, we multiply the car's average speed (45 miles per hour) by the time (3 hours)
* 45 miles per hour x 3 hours = 135 miles

Answer: 135
