Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Inez has $150 to start with.
2) She spends one-half of her $150 on hockey skates. That means she spent $75 on the skates.
3) After buying the skates, she has $150 - $75 = $75 remaining.
4) Inez has $25 remaining after buying the hockey pads.
5) To find the cost of the hockey pads, we can subtract the remaining $25 from the $75 she had left after buying the skates.
6) $75 - $25 = $50
Therefore, the hockey pads cost $50.

Answer: $50
