Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The school has 15 classrooms total.
2) One-third of the classrooms have 30 desks each.
   * One-third of 15 is 5, so 5 classrooms have 30 desks each.
   * 5 classrooms x 30 desks per classroom = 150 desks
3) The remaining two-thirds of the classrooms have 25 desks each.
   * Two-thirds of 15 is 10, so 10 classrooms have 25 desks each.
   * 10 classrooms x 25 desks per classroom = 250 desks
4) Adding the desks from the two types of classrooms:
   * 150 desks + 250 desks = 400 desks
Therefore, the school can accommodate 400 students, with each student having their own desk.

Answer: 400
