Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jackie ordered:
  - 2 bottles of shampoo and conditioner at $10.00 each, so that's 2 x $10.00 = $20.00
  - 3 bottles of lotion at $6.00 each, so that's 3 x $6.00 = $18.00
* The total amount Jackie spent is $20.00 + $18.00 = $38.00
* The minimum amount required to be eligible for free shipping is $50.00
* To calculate how much more Jackie needs to spend, we take the minimum amount ($50.00) and subtract the amount she has already spent ($38.00):
* $50.00 - $38.00 = $12.00

Answer: $12
