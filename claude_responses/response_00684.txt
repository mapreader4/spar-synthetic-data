Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Grace can read a 200-page book in 20 hours.
2) This means she reads 200 pages in 20 hours, or 10 pages per hour.
3) We want to find how long it would take her to read a 250-page book at the same rate of 10 pages per hour.
4) To calculate the time, we divide the total number of pages (250) by the number of pages read per hour (10).
5) 250 pages / 10 pages per hour = 25 hours.

Answer: 25 hours.
