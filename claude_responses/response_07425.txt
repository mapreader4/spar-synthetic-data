Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lars can bake 10 loaves of bread in 1 hour
* Lars can bake 30 baguettes in 2 hours
* Lars bakes for 6 hours per day

First, let's calculate how many loaves of bread Lars can bake in 6 hours:
* 10 loaves per hour x 6 hours = 60 loaves of bread

Next, let's calculate how many baguettes Lars can bake in 6 hours:
* 30 baguettes per 2 hours x 3 (since 6 hours is 3 sets of 2 hours) = 90 baguettes

Finally, to get the total number of breads Lars makes in 6 hours, we add the loaves of bread and baguettes:
* 60 loaves + 90 baguettes = 150 breads

Answer: 150
