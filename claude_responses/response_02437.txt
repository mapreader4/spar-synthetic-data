Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emma starts with $100 in her account
* Each day, she spends $8
* There are 7 days in a week
* So, the total amount she spends in a week is:
    - 7 days x $8 per day = $56
* Therefore, the amount remaining in her account at the end of the week is:
    - $100 - $56 = $44
* Emma then asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her
* $44 / $5 per bill = 8 bills
* The remaining amount in her account is:
    - $44 - (8 x $5) = $44 - $40 = $4

Answer: $4
