Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Day 1:
* Maria sold 30 tulips and 20 roses
* Tulips: 30 x $2 = $60
* Roses: 20 x $3 = $60
* Total earnings on Day 1 = $60 + $60 = $120

Day 2:
* Maria doubled the previous day's sales
* Tulips: 30 x 2 = 60 tulips
* Roses: 20 x 2 = 40 roses
* Tulips: 60 x $2 = $120
* Roses: 40 x $3 = $120
* Total earnings on Day 2 = $120 + $120 = $240

Day 3:
* Maria sold 10% of the tulips sold on the second day and 16 roses
* Tulips: 60 x 0.1 = 6 tulips
* Roses: 16
* Tulips: 6 x $2 = $12
* Roses: 16 x $3 = $48
* Total earnings on Day 3 = $12 + $48 = $60

Total earnings over the three days:
* Day 1: $120
* Day 2: $240
* Day 3: $60
* Total earnings = $120 + $240 + $60 = $420

Answer: $420
