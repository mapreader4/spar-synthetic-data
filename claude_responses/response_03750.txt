Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The factory made 12000 dolls last month.
2) Each doll requires the following accessories:
   - 2 shoes
   - 3 bags
   - 1 set of cosmetics
   - 5 hats
3) Each doll takes 45 seconds to make.
4) Each accessory takes 10 seconds to make.
5) To calculate the total time required to make all the dolls and accessories:
   - Time to make 12000 dolls: 12000 * 45 seconds = 540,000 seconds
   - Time to make the accessories:
     - 2 shoes per doll = 12000 * 2 * 10 seconds = 240,000 seconds
     - 3 bags per doll = 12000 * 3 * 10 seconds = 360,000 seconds
     - 1 set of cosmetics per doll = 12000 * 1 * 10 seconds = 120,000 seconds
     - 5 hats per doll = 12000 * 5 * 10 seconds = 600,000 seconds
   - Total time for accessories = 240,000 + 360,000 + 120,000 + 600,000 = 1,320,000 seconds
6) Total combined machine operation time = 540,000 seconds (for dolls) + 1,320,000 seconds (for accessories) = 1,860,000 seconds

Answer: 1,860,000
