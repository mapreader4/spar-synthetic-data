Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The hare runs at 10 feet/second, and the turtle crawls at 1 foot/second.
2) The race distance is 20 feet.
3) For the turtle to finish in a tie with the hare, the turtle must cover the 20 feet at the same time as the hare.
4) The time it takes for the hare to cover 20 feet is 20 feet / 10 feet/second = 2 seconds.
5) The time it takes for the turtle to cover 20 feet is 20 feet / 1 foot/second = 20 seconds.
6) Therefore, the turtle needs a head start of 20 seconds - 2 seconds = 18 seconds.

Answer: 18 seconds
