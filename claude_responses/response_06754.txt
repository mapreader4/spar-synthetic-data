Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Peter drew 8 pictures
* Quincy drew 20 more pictures than Peter
* So Quincy drew 8 + 20 = 28 pictures
* The total number of pictures drawn is 41
* To find the number of pictures Randy drew, we need to subtract the number of pictures drawn by Peter and Quincy from the total number of pictures drawn:
* Total pictures drawn = 41
* Pictures drawn by Peter = 8
* Pictures drawn by Quincy = 28
* Pictures drawn by Randy = 41 - 8 - 28 = 5
