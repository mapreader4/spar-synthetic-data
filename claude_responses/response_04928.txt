Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* The number of swans in Rita's pond doubles every 2 years
* Currently, there are 15 swans in the pond
* We want to know how many swans there will be in 10 years

To calculate the number of swans in 10 years, we need to determine how many doubling periods there are in 10 years.
* Since the number of swans doubles every 2 years, there are 10 years / 2 years per doubling = 5 doubling periods in 10 years.

Now, we can calculate the number of swans after 5 doubling periods:
* Starting with 15 swans
* After 1 doubling period (2 years), there will be 15 * 2 = 30 swans
* After 2 doubling periods (4 years), there will be 30 * 2 = 60 swans
* After 3 doubling periods (6 years), there will be 60 * 2 = 120 swans
* After 4 doubling periods (8 years), there will be 120 * 2 = 240 swans
* After 5 doubling periods (10 years), there will be 240 * 2 = 480 swans

Answer: 480 swans
