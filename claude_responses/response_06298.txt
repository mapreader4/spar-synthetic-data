Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) Marc bought 50 episodes of the show "Friends" online.
2) Each day, Marc watches 1/10 of the episodes he bought.
3) To find how many days it will take Marc to finish 50 episodes, we need to divide the total number of episodes (50) by the number of episodes he watches each day (1/10 of 50 = 5).
4) 50 episodes / 5 episodes per day = 10 days.

Answer: 10
