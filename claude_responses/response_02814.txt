To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Josie spent waiting and subtract it from the total time of her shopping trip.

Given information:
- Josie waited 3 minutes for a cart.
- Josie waited 13 minutes for an employee to unlock a cabinet.
- Josie waited 14 minutes for a stocker to restock a shelf.
- Josie waited 18 minutes in line to check out.
- Josie's shopping trip took an hour and a half, which is 90 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total time Josie spent waiting.
Total time waiting = 3 minutes + 13 minutes + 14 minutes + 18 minutes = 48 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time Josie spent shopping instead of waiting.
Time spent shopping = Total time of shopping trip - Total time waiting
Time spent shopping = 90 minutes - 48 minutes = 42 minutes

Answer: 42 minutes
