Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jennifer initially purchased 40 cans of milk
* For every 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans
* Mark purchased 50 cans

To calculate how many additional cans Jennifer bought:
* Mark bought 50 cans
* For every 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans
* So, 50 cans / 5 cans per set = 10 sets
* 10 sets * 6 additional cans per set = 60 additional cans

Now, we can calculate the total number of cans Jennifer brought home:
* Jennifer initially bought 40 cans
* Jennifer bought an additional 60 cans
* Total cans Jennifer brought home = 40 + 60 = 100 cans

Answer: 100
