Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The number of students who ordered burgers is 30.
2) The number of students who ordered hot dogs is twice the number of students who ordered burgers.
3) To find the number of students who ordered hot dogs, we multiply the number of students who ordered burgers by 2:
   * Number of students who ordered hot dogs = 30 x 2 = 60
4) To find the total number of students at the restaurant, we add the number of students who ordered burgers and the number of students who ordered hot dogs:
   * Total number of students = 30 + 60 = 90

Answer: 90
