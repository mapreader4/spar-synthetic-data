Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cottage costs $5 per hour.
2) Jack and Jill rented the cottage for 8 hours.
3) To calculate the total cost of renting the cottage, we multiply the hourly rate ($5) by the number of hours (8):
   Total cost = $5 x 8 = $40
4) Since Jack and Jill are sharing the cost, we divide the total cost by 2 to determine how much each friend pays:
   Amount each friend pays = $40 / 2 = $20

Answer: $20
