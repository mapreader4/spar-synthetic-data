Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) In the morning, the shop sold 29 bags of potatoes.
2) In the afternoon, the shop sold 17 bags of potatoes.
3) Each bag of potatoes weighs 7kg.
4) To calculate the total kilograms of potatoes sold for the whole day, we need to add the morning and afternoon sales:
   - Morning sales: 29 bags x 7kg/bag = 203kg
   - Afternoon sales: 17 bags x 7kg/bag = 119kg
   - Total kilograms sold for the whole day: 203kg + 119kg = 322kg

Answer: 322
