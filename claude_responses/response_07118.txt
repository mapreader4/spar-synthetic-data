Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mrs. Dunbar needs to make 5 bouquets
* Each bouquet requires 5 white roses
* So for the 5 bouquets, she needs 5 * 5 = 25 white roses
* Mrs. Dunbar also needs to make 7 table decorations
* Each table decoration requires 12 white roses
* So for the 7 table decorations, she needs 7 * 12 = 84 white roses
* To find the total number of white roses needed, we add the number of roses for the bouquets and the table decorations:
* 25 + 84 = 109
Answer: 109
