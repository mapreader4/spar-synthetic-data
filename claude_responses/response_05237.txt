Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Wanda walks .5 miles to school in the morning
* She then walks .5 miles back home
* This is a total of 1 mile per day
* She repeats this in the afternoon, so that's another 1 mile per day
* In total, she walks 2 miles per day
* She does this 5 days a week
* So in 1 week, she walks 2 miles x 5 days = 10 miles
* After 4 weeks, she would walk 10 miles x 4 weeks = 40 miles

Answer: 40 miles
