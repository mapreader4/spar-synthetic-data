Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Nick's cell phone was initially empty, meaning it had a 0% charge.
2) The cell phone was then charged for 45 minutes and has reached a 25% charge.
3) To reach 100% charge, the cell phone needs to be charged for the remaining 75% (100% - 25%).
4) Since the cell phone was charged for 45 minutes to reach 25% charge, we can use this information to calculate how long it will take to reach the remaining 75%.
5) We can set up a proportion:
45 minutes / 25% = x minutes / 75%
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = (45 minutes * 75%) / 25% = 135 minutes
7) Therefore, the cell phone must be charged for an additional 135 minutes to reach 100% charge.

Answer: 135 minutes
