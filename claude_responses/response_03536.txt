Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Katya sold 8 glasses of lemonade
2) Ricky sold 9 glasses of lemonade
3) Katya and Ricky's combined sales = 8 + 9 = 17 glasses
4) Tina sold twice as many as Katya and Ricky's combined sales, which is 2 * 17 = 34 glasses
5) Tina sold 34 glasses, and Katya sold 8 glasses
6) The difference between Tina's sales and Katya's sales is 34 - 8 = 26 glasses

Answer: 26
