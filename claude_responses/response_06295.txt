Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Brady gets paid 70 cents for each recipe card he transcribes
* He also gets a $10 bonus each time he transcribes 100 cards
* He transcribes 200 cards

First, let's calculate how much he earns for the 200 cards he transcribed:
* 200 cards x $0.70 per card = $140

Now, let's calculate the bonus he gets:
* He transcribed 200 cards, which is 2 sets of 100 cards
* 2 sets of 100 cards = 2 bonuses of $10 each
* 2 x $10 = $20

Finally, to get the total amount he earned, we add the amount he earned for the cards and the bonuses:
* $140 + $20 = $160

Answer: $160
