Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jasmine's shoe size is 7.
2) Alexa's shoe size is twice as big as Jasmine's, so Alexa's shoe size is 7 x 2 = 14.
3) To find the combined shoe size, we add Jasmine's and Alexa's shoe sizes together:
   Jasmine's shoe size: 7
   Alexa's shoe size: 14
   Combined shoe size: 7 + 14 = 21

Answer: 21
