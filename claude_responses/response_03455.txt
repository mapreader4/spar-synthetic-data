Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sunny bakes 8 cakes.
2) She then gives away 2 cakes, leaving her with 8 - 2 = 6 cakes.
3) She wants to put 6 candles on each of the remaining 6 cakes.
4) To calculate the total number of candles, we multiply the number of cakes (6) by the number of candles per cake (6):
6 cakes x 6 candles per cake = 36 candles.

Answer: 36
