Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The sack of rice weighs 50 kilograms.
2) The sack of rice costs $50.
3) David sells the rice for $1.20 per kilogram.
4) To calculate the total selling price, we multiply the weight (50 kg) by the selling price per kilogram ($1.20):
   50 kg x $1.20 = $60
5) To calculate the profit, we subtract the original cost ($50) from the total selling price ($60):
   $60 - $50 = $10
Answer: $10
