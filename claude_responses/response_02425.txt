Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mabel has 5 daisies in her garden.
2) Each daisy has 8 petals.
3) Mabel gives 2 daisies to her teacher.
4) To find the number of petals on the remaining daisies, we need to:
   a) Calculate the total number of petals on the 5 daisies: 5 daisies x 8 petals per daisy = 40 petals.
   b) Subtract the number of petals on the 2 daisies given to the teacher: 2 daisies x 8 petals per daisy = 16 petals.
   c) The remaining number of petals is 40 - 16 = 24 petals.

Answer: 24
