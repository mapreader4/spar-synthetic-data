Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Chad has 100 apples of different sizes and price ranges
* Small apples cost $1.5 each
* Medium apples cost $2 each
* Big apples cost $3 each
* Donny bought:
    - 6 small and medium apples
    - 8 big apples
To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of the small/medium apples and the big apples separately, then add them together.

Cost of small/medium apples:
* 6 apples at $1.5 each = 6 * $1.5 = $9
* 6 apples at $2 each = 6 * $2 = $12
* Total cost of small/medium apples = $9 + $12 = $21

Cost of big apples:
* 8 apples at $3 each = 8 * $3 = $24

Total cost:
* Cost of small/medium apples + Cost of big apples = $21 + $24 = $45

Answer: $45
