Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears
* This means the number of white bears is half the number of black bears
* The number of black bears is given as 60
* So the number of white bears is 60 / 2 = 30
* Christi also saw 40 more brown bears than black bears
* So the number of brown bears is 60 + 40 = 100

Now, to calculate the total population of bears in the park, we add up the number of black, white, and brown bears:
* Total bears = 60 (black) + 30 (white) + 100 (brown)
* Total bears = 190

Answer: 190
