Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Connie spent half of her tickets on a stuffed koala bear
* She spent 10 tickets on a pair of earbuds
* She spent another 15 tickets on glow bracelets
* Let's call the total number of tickets Connie redeemed today as 'x'
* She spent half of 'x' on the stuffed koala bear, which is x/2
* She spent 10 tickets on the earbuds
* She spent 15 tickets on the glow bracelets
* So the total number of tickets spent is: x/2 + 10 + 15
* We know that the total number of tickets spent is equal to the total number of tickets redeemed, so:
* x = x/2 + 10 + 15
* Solving for x, we get:
* x/2 = 25
* x = 50

Answer: 50
