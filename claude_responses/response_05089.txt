Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Daytona Beach has 12 sharks.
2) Cape May has 8 more than twice as many sharks as Daytona Beach.
3) To find the number of sharks in Cape May, we first need to find twice the number of sharks in Daytona Beach.
4) Twice the number of sharks in Daytona Beach is 2 x 12 = 24 sharks.
5) Cape May has 8 more than 24 sharks, so the number of sharks in Cape May is 24 + 8 = 32 sharks.

Answer: 32 sharks
