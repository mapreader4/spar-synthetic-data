Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Justin can run 2 blocks in 1.5 minutes
* This means he can run 1 block in 0.75 minutes (1.5 minutes / 2 blocks)
* He is 8 blocks from home
* To find the time it takes him to run 8 blocks, we can multiply the time it takes to run 1 block (0.75 minutes) by the number of blocks (8)
* 0.75 minutes x 8 blocks = 6 minutes

Answer: 6 minutes
