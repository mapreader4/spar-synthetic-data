Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tim is 5 years old.
2) Rommel is thrice as old as Tim, so Rommel's age is 3 x 5 = 15 years old.
3) Jenny is 2 years older than Rommel, so Jenny's age is 15 + 2 = 17 years old.
4) To find how many years younger Tim is than Jenny, we subtract Tim's age from Jenny's age:
17 years - 5 years = 12 years.

Answer: 12 years
