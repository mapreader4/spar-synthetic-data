Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vivian plays 10 songs per day
* Clara plays 2 fewer songs per day, so she plays 8 songs per day
* In June, there were 8 weekend days where they didn't play any songs
* So, the number of days they played songs in June is 30 days - 8 weekend days = 22 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of songs they listened to in June:
* Vivian's total songs = 10 songs/day x 22 days = 220 songs
* Clara's total songs = 8 songs/day x 22 days = 176 songs
* Total songs listened to = Vivian's songs + Clara's songs = 220 + 176 = 396 songs

Answer: 396
