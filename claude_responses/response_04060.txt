Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The square playground has a side length of 12 meters.
2) The area of the playground is the side length squared: 12 meters x 12 meters = 144 square meters.
3) The maintenance building measures 8 meters by 5 meters.
4) The area of the maintenance building is 8 meters x 5 meters = 40 square meters.
5) To find the area of the playground that is not covered by the maintenance building, we subtract the area of the maintenance building from the total area of the playground:
144 square meters - 40 square meters = 104 square meters.

Answer: 104 square meters.
