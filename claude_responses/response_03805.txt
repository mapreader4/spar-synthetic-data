Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Janet gets paid $70 an hour for exterminator work, and she does 20 hours of exterminator work.
   * Exterminator work income = $70 per hour x 20 hours = $1,400

2. Janet makes $20 per pound on her ant nest sculptures.
   * She sells a 5-pound sculpture and a 7-pound sculpture.
   * Sculpture 1 income = $20 per pound x 5 pounds = $100
   * Sculpture 2 income = $20 per pound x 7 pounds = $140
   * Total sculpture income = $100 + $140 = $240

3. To calculate the total money Janet makes, we add the exterminator work income and the sculpture income:
   * Total money made = Exterminator work income + Sculpture income
   * Total money made = $1,400 + $240 = $1,640

Answer: $1,640
