Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dylan's mother is expecting 40 guests
* The guests arrive in 10 cars
* Each car has 4 wheels
* Dylan's mother and father's cars are also in the parking lot

To calculate the total number of car wheels in the parking lot, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of wheels from the 10 guest cars
2. Add the wheels from Dylan's mother's car and Dylan's father's jeep

Step 1: Number of wheels from the 10 guest cars
* Each car has 4 wheels
* There are 10 cars
* So, 10 cars x 4 wheels per car = 40 wheels from the guest cars

Step 2: Add the wheels from Dylan's mother's car and Dylan's father's jeep
* Dylan's mother's car has 4 wheels
* Dylan's father's jeep has 4 wheels
* So, 4 wheels + 4 wheels = 8 wheels

Step 3: Add the wheels from the guest cars and Dylan's parents' cars
* 40 wheels (guest cars) + 8 wheels (Dylan's parents' cars) = 48 wheels

Answer: 48
