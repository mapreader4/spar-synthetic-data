Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes
* We want to know how many oysters he can shuck in 2 hours
* 2 hours = 120 minutes
* In 5 minutes, he can shuck 10 oysters
* So in 120 minutes (2 hours), he can shuck:
* (120 minutes / 5 minutes) * 10 oysters = 240 oysters

Answer: 240
