Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Miranda needs 2 pounds of feathers for each pillow.
2) A pound of goose feathers is approximately 300 feathers.
3) Miranda's goose has approximately 3600 feathers.
4) To calculate the number of pillows Miranda can stuff, we first need to find out how many pounds of feathers she can get from her goose.
5) Since her goose has 3600 feathers, and 1 pound of feathers is 300 feathers, she can get 3600 / 300 = 12 pounds of feathers from her goose.
6) Since Miranda needs 2 pounds of feathers per pillow, she can stuff 12 / 2 = 6 pillows with the feathers from her goose.
