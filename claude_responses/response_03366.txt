Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Simon has 30 red stamps, and each red stamp is sold for 50 cents.
2) So the total amount of money Simon makes from selling his red stamps is:
30 red stamps x 50 cents per stamp = $15
3) Peter has 80 white stamps, and each white stamp is sold for 20 cents.
4) So the total amount of money Peter makes from selling his white stamps is:
80 white stamps x 20 cents per stamp = $16
5) The difference in the amount of money they make is:
$16 (Peter) - $15 (Simon) = $1

Answer: $1
