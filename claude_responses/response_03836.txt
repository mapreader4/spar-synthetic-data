Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 5 shirts in total
* The total cost of the 5 shirts is $85
* 3 of the shirts cost $15 each
* The remaining 2 shirts are equal in value

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 3 shirts that cost $15 each:
* 3 shirts x $15 per shirt = $45

Now, we can subtract this amount from the total cost of $85 to find the cost of the remaining 2 shirts:
* $85 - $45 = $40

Since the remaining 2 shirts are equal in value, we can divide the remaining cost ($40) by 2 to find the cost of one of the remaining shirts:
* $40 / 2 = $20

Answer: $20
