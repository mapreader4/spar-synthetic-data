Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Mary spent 10 minutes downloading the Mac version of Zoom.
2. She then realized she needed the Windows version, which took three times as long to download. So the time spent downloading the Windows version was 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.
3. During her first call, the audio glitched twice for 4 minutes each time, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 minutes of audio glitching.
4. The video glitched once for 6 minutes.
5. The total time spent with glitches was 8 + 6 = 14 minutes.
6. She spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches, so the time spent talking without glitches was 2 * 14 = 28 minutes.
7. The total time spent downloading Zoom was 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.
8. The total time spent talking was 14 + 28 = 42 minutes.
9. The total time spent downloading Zoom and talking was 40 + 42 = 82 minutes.

Answer: 82
