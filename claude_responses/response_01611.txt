Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, they traveled 200 miles.
2. On the second day, they traveled 3/4 as far as the first day. 
   * 3/4 of 200 miles = 150 miles
3. On the third day, they traveled 1/2 as many miles as the first two days combined.
   * The first two days they traveled 200 + 150 = 350 miles
   * 1/2 of 350 miles = 175 miles

Now, to find the total miles traveled for the 3 days, we add up the miles traveled each day:
* 200 miles + 150 miles + 175 miles = 525 miles

Answer: 525
