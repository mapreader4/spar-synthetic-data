Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Daniel practices basketball for 15 minutes each day during the school week (Monday through Friday)
* That's 5 days of 15 minutes each, so that's 5 x 15 = 75 minutes during the school week
* On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he practices twice as long each day
* That's 2 x 15 = 30 minutes each day on the weekend
* So on the weekend, he practices for 30 minutes on Saturday and 30 minutes on Sunday, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes
* To get the total minutes of practice in a whole week, we add the school week practice (75 minutes) and the weekend practice (60 minutes):
* 75 minutes + 60 minutes = 135 minutes

Answer: 135
