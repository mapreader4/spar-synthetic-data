Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first set contains 50 marbles, and 10% of them are broken.
   * 10% of 50 = 0.10 * 50 = 5 marbles are broken in the first set.

2. The second set contains 60 marbles, and 20% of them are broken.
   * 20% of 60 = 0.20 * 60 = 12 marbles are broken in the second set.

3. To find the total number of broken marbles, we add the broken marbles from both sets:
   * 5 + 12 = 17 marbles are broken in total.

Answer: 17
