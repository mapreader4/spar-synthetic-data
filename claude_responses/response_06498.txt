Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) DeShaun read 60 books over the summer, which was 80 days long.
2) Each book averaged 320 pages long.
3) To find the total number of pages DeShaun read, we multiply the number of books (60) by the average pages per book (320):
60 books x 320 pages/book = 19,200 total pages
4) The person closest to DeShaun read 75% as much as he did.
5) To find the total number of pages the second person read, we take 75% of DeShaun's total pages:
19,200 pages x 0.75 = 14,400 total pages
6) To find the average number of pages the second person read per day, we divide the total pages by the number of days in the summer break:
14,400 pages / 80 days = 180 pages/day

Answer: 180
