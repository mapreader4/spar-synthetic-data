To solve this problem, we need to find the total monthly savings and then divide it equally between Richard and Sarah.

Given information:
- It will take Richard and Sarah 3 years to save enough for a down payment on a house.
- The down payment on the house is $108,000.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount they need to save.
Total amount to save = $108,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount they need to save per month.
Total amount to save per month = Total amount to save / (3 years × 12 months per year)
Total amount to save per month = $108,000 / (3 × 12)
Total amount to save per month = $3,000

Step 3: Calculate the amount each person saves per month.
Amount each person saves per month = Total amount to save per month / 2
Amount each person saves per month = $3,000 / 2
Amount each person saves per month = $1,500

Answer: $1,500
