Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sam memorized 6 more digits of pi than Carlos
* Mina memorized 6 times as many digits of pi as Carlos
* Mina memorized 24 digits of pi

First, let's find out how many digits Carlos memorized:
* Mina memorized 6 times as many digits as Carlos
* Mina memorized 24 digits
* Therefore, Carlos memorized 24 / 6 = 4 digits

Now, we can find out how many digits Sam memorized:
* Sam memorized 6 more digits than Carlos
* Carlos memorized 4 digits
* Therefore, Sam memorized 4 + 6 = 10 digits

Answer: 10
