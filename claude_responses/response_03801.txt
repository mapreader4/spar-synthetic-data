Okay, let's break this down step by step:

Safari National Park:
* 100 lions
* Half as many snakes as lions, so 50 snakes
* 10 fewer giraffes than snakes, so 40 giraffes

Savanna National Park:
* Double the number of lions as Safari National Park, so 200 lions
* Triple the number of snakes as Safari National Park, so 150 snakes
* 20 more giraffes than Safari National Park, so 60 giraffes

Now, to find the total number of animals in Savanna National Park, we add up the number of lions, snakes, and giraffes:
* 200 lions + 150 snakes + 60 giraffes = 410 animals

Answer: 410
