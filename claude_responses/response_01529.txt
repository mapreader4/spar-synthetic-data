Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total population of the town is 5,000 people.
2) There are 2,000 males in the town.
3) The remaining population are females, so the number of females is 5,000 - 2,000 = 3,000.
4) 30% of the female population wears glasses.
5) To find the number of females who wear glasses, we take 30% of the female population:
30% of 3,000 = 0.30 * 3,000 = 900.

Answer: 900
