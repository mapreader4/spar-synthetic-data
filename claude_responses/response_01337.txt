Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Bonny just bought her 13th pair of shoes.
2) This is 5 less than twice as many pairs of shoes as Becky owns.
   * Let's call the number of pairs of shoes Becky owns as 'x'.
   * Bonny has 2x - 5 pairs of shoes.
3) Bobby has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Becky has.
   * Bobby has 3x pairs of shoes.

Now, we can solve for the number of shoes Bobby has:
* Bobby has 3x pairs of shoes
* Answer: 3x
