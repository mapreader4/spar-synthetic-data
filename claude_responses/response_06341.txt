Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cargo ship takes 21 days to navigate from Shanghai to Vancouver
* The customs and regulatory processes in Vancouver take 4 days
* It takes 7 days to move the cargo from the port to the rural warehouse
* The total time from departure to arrival at the warehouse is 21 + 4 + 7 = 32 days
* The shipment is expected to arrive 2 days from today
* Therefore, the ship should have departed 32 - 2 = 30 days ago

Answer: 30
