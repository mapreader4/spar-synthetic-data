Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jacob is currently 24 years old
* Tony is half of Jacob's age, so Tony is currently 24 / 2 = 12 years old
* We want to know how old Tony will be in 6 years

To find Tony's age in 6 years, we simply add 6 years to his current age:
* Tony's age in 6 years = 12 + 6 = 18 years old

Answer: 18
