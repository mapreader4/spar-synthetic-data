Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lightning McQueen costs $140,000.
2) Mater costs 10% of what Lightning McQueen costs.
   * 10% of $140,000 = 0.10 * $140,000 = $14,000
   * So, Mater costs $14,000.
3) Sally McQueen costs triple what Mater costs.
   * Mater costs $14,000, so Sally McQueen costs 3 * $14,000 = $42,000.

Answer: $42,000.
