Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.

2. Juanita buys the newspaper daily.
   - Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 per day.
   - On Sunday, she spends $2.00.

3. To calculate Juanita's yearly cost:
   - Monday through Saturday (6 days per week): 6 days x $0.50 = $3.00 per week
   - Sunday: $2.00 per week
   - Total per week: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 per week
   - Weeks in a year: 52
   - Juanita's yearly cost: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00

4. To calculate the difference between Juanita's and Grant's yearly cost:
   - Juanita's yearly cost: $260.00
   - Grant's yearly cost: $200.00
   - Difference: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00

Answer: $60.00
