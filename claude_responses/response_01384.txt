Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Bill needs to stock 60 pots.
2) On each shelf, he can stack 5 pots vertically.
3) On each shelf, he can have 3 sets of vertically stacked pots side-by-side.
4) So each shelf can hold 5 * 3 = 15 pots.
5) To calculate the number of shelves needed, we divide the total number of pots (60) by the number of pots per shelf (15):
60 / 15 = 4 shelves.
