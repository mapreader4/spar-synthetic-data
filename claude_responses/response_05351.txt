Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 12 patrons who came in cars and 27 from a bus waiting in the overflow parking lot.
2) The total number of patrons waiting in the overflow lot is 12 + 27 = 39.
3) Ellen can fit 3 patrons in a golf cart.
4) To calculate the number of golf carts needed, we need to divide the total number of patrons by the number of patrons per cart.
5) 39 patrons / 3 patrons per cart = 13 golf carts.

Answer: 13
