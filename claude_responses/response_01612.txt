Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Paul earns $12.50 for each hour he works.
2) He worked 40 hours.
3) So his total earnings before taxes and fees are:
   40 hours x $12.50 per hour = $500
4) He has to pay 20% for taxes and fees.
   $500 x 0.20 = $100
5) So his net pay after taxes and fees is:
   $500 - $100 = $400
6) He spends 15% of his paycheck on gummy bears.
   $400 x 0.15 = $60
7) The amount he has left is:
   $400 - $60 = $340

Answer: $340
