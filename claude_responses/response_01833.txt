Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The wall area to be painted is 600 sq. ft.
2) A gallon of paint can cover 400 sq. ft.
3) Linda wants to do two coats of paint.
4) To calculate the total area that needs to be painted, we multiply the wall area by 2 (since she wants to do two coats): 600 sq. ft. x 2 = 1,200 sq. ft.
5) To find how many gallons of paint are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon: 1,200 sq. ft. / 400 sq. ft. per gallon = 3 gallons.
6) Since we need to round up to the nearest whole number, Linda will have to buy 4 gallon cans of paint.
