Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Opal won $100.00 betting on a horse race.
2) She put half of her winnings ($50.00) into savings.
3) She bet the other half of her winnings ($50.00).
4) She made a 60% profit on the $50.00 she bet.
   * 60% of $50.00 is $30.00.
   * So, she earned $80.00 (the original $50.00 plus the $30.00 profit).
5) She put half of her earnings ($40.00) into savings.

Therefore, the total amount Opal put into her savings is:
* $50.00 (from the first half of her winnings) + $40.00 (from the second half of her winnings) = $90.00

Answer: 90
