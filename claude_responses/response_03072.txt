Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Martha originally had 18 crayons.
2) She lost half of them, which means she lost 18 / 2 = 9 crayons.
3) So, she had 18 - 9 = 9 crayons left.
4) She then bought a new set of 20 crayons.
5) The total number of crayons Martha has after the purchase is the number of crayons she had left (9) plus the new set of crayons she bought (20).
6) 9 + 20 = 29 crayons.

Answer: 29
