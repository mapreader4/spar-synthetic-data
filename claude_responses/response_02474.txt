Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The base sentence is 1 year of jail for every $5,000 of goods stolen.
2) The burglar stole $40,000 worth of goods.
3) To calculate the base sentence, we divide the total amount stolen ($40,000) by the amount per year ($5,000):
   $40,000 / $5,000 = 8 years
4) The sentence is then increased by 25% because this is the burglar's third offense:
   8 years x 1.25 = 10 years
5) Finally, 2 additional years are added for resisting arrest.
6) The total sentence is therefore:
   10 years + 2 years = 12 years

Answer: 12 years
