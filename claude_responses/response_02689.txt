Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Devin taught Calculus for 4 years.
2) He taught Algebra for twice as many years as Calculus, which is 2 x 4 = 8 years.
3) He taught Statistics for 5 times as long as he taught Algebra, which is 5 x 8 = 40 years.

Now, to find the total number of years Devin has taught, we add up the years for each subject:
4 years (Calculus) + 8 years (Algebra) + 40 years (Statistics) = 52 years

Answer: 52
