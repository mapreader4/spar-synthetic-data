Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The colony started with an unknown number of penguins.
* In the first year, the size of the colony doubled.
* In the second year, the size of the colony tripled.
* This year, the colony gained 129 penguins, and now has 1077 penguins.

To find the original number of penguins, we can work backwards:
* This year, the colony has 1077 penguins.
* Last year, the colony had 1077 - 129 = 948 penguins.
* The year before that, the colony had 948 / 3 = 316 penguins.
* The year before that, the colony had 316 / 2 = 158 penguins.

So the original number of penguins in the colony was 158.

Each penguin eats 1.5 fish per day, so the total number of fish the colony eats per day is:
* 158 penguins x 1.5 fish per penguin = 237 fish per day

Answer: 237
