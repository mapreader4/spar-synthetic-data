Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mike throws 20 seeds to the birds on the left.
2) He throws twice as much to the bigger group of birds on the right, which is 2 x 20 = 40 seeds.
3) Mike then throws 30 more seeds for the additional birds that flutter over.
4) In total, Mike has thrown 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 seeds.
5) Mike has 30 seeds left to feed the last of the birds.
6) Therefore, the total number of seeds Mike started with is 90 + 30 = 120 seeds.

Answer: 120
