Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kimberly started with a 4-liter bottle of water.
2) The first time she drank from it, she consumed a quarter of the water in the bottle.
   * A quarter of 4 liters is 1 liter.
   * So, after the first drink, there are 4 liters - 1 liter = 3 liters of water left in the bottle.
3) Later on, she drank 2/3rd of the remaining water.
   * 2/3rd of 3 liters is 2 liters.
   * So, after the second drink, there are 3 liters - 2 liters = 1 liter of water left in the bottle.

Answer: 1 liter
