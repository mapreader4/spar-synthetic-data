Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Each student needs to buy 5 complete uniforms.
2. Each uniform consists of pants, shirt, tie, and socks.
3. The pants cost $20.
4. The shirt costs twice as much as the pants, so the shirt costs $40.
5. The tie costs 1/5 as much as the shirt, so the tie costs $8.
6. The socks cost $3 per pair.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for one complete uniform:
* Pants: $20
* Shirt: $40
* Tie: $8
* Socks: $3 (1 pair)
* Total cost per uniform: $20 + $40 + $8 + $3 = $71

Since each student needs to buy 5 complete uniforms, the total cost for each student is:
* 5 uniforms x $71 per uniform = $355

Answer: $355
