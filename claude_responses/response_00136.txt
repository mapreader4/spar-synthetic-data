Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Loraine makes wax sculptures of animals
* Large animals take 4 sticks of wax, and small animals take 2 sticks of wax
* She made three times as many small animals as large animals
* She used 12 sticks of wax for small animals

First, let's figure out how many small animals she made:
* She used 12 sticks of wax for small animals
* Each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax
* So, the number of small animals = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we know that she made three times as many small animals as large animals, so:
* Number of large animals = 6 / 3 = 2

Now, we can calculate the total number of sticks of wax used:
* 2 large animals x 4 sticks per large animal = 8 sticks
* 6 small animals x 2 sticks per small animal = 12 sticks
* Total sticks of wax used = 8 + 12 = 20 sticks

Answer: 20
