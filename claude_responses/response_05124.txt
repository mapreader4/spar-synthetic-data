Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day
* Janet has 80 horses
* So the total amount of fertilizer produced per day is:
    * 80 horses x 5 gallons/horse = 400 gallons per day
* Each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer
* Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day
* The total area to be fertilized is 20 acres
* To calculate how long it will take to fertilize all 20 acres:
    * 20 acres / 4 acres per day = 5 days

Answer: 5 days
