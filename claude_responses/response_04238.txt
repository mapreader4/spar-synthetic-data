Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The sandwich was normally $8
* Luca had a coupon for a quarter (25%) of the price off
* So the discounted price of the sandwich was $8 - (0.25 * $8) = $8 - $2 = $6
* He then added sliced avocado for an extra $1
* So the total cost of the sandwich was $6 + $1 = $7
* He also added a $3 salad
* The total of the sandwich and salad was $7 + $3 = $10
* The total lunch bill was $12
* So the cost of the drink must have been $12 - $10 = $2

Answer: $2
