Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total cost of the HVAC system is $20,000
* The system includes 2 conditioning zones
* Each conditioning zone has 5 vents
* To calculate the cost per vent, we need to find the total number of vents in the system and then divide the total cost by the number of vents

First, let's find the total number of vents:
* There are 2 conditioning zones
* Each conditioning zone has 5 vents
* Therefore, the total number of vents is 2 x 5 = 10 vents

Now, to find the cost per vent, we divide the total cost by the total number of vents:
* Total cost: $20,000
* Total number of vents: 10
* Cost per vent = $20,000 / 10 = $2,000

Answer: $2,000
