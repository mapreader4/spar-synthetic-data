Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Leo had 400 marbles in a jar.
2) He packed the marbles with ten marbles in each pack.
3) To find the number of packs, we divide the total number of marbles (400) by the number of marbles in each pack (10):
400 รท 10 = 40 packs
4) Leo gave Manny 1/4 of the number of packs:
1/4 of 40 packs = 10 packs
5) Leo gave Neil 1/8 of the number of packs:
1/8 of 40 packs = 5 packs
6) The number of packs Leo kept is the total number of packs (40) minus the number of packs he gave to Manny (10) and the number of packs he gave to Neil (5):
40 - 10 - 5 = 25 packs

Answer: 25 packs
