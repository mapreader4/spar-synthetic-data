Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Trent caught 180 tadpoles
* He then let 75% of them go
* To find out how many he kept, we need to find the remaining 25% of the tadpoles

First, let's calculate 75% of 180:
* 75% of 180 = 0.75 * 180 = 135

Now, we can subtract the number of tadpoles he let go (135) from the total number of tadpoles he caught (180) to find the number of tadpoles he kept:
* 180 - 135 = 45

Answer: 45
