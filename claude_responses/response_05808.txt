Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total time to clean the room is 8 hours
* Lilly was responsible for a quarter of the time spent cleaning
* Fiona was responsible for the rest of the cleaning time

First, we need to calculate how much time Lilly spent cleaning:
* Lilly was responsible for a quarter of the time
* 1/4 of 8 hours = 2 hours

Now, we can calculate how much time Fiona spent cleaning:
* Fiona was responsible for the rest of the cleaning time
* Total time - Lilly's time = Fiona's time
* 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours

Finally, we need to convert Fiona's cleaning time from hours to minutes:
* 6 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes

Answer: 360 minutes
