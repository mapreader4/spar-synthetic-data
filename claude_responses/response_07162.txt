Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The chicken crossed the road twice for the thrill of it
* The first time, it had to dodge 23 speeding cars
* The second time, a person tried to catch it and accidentally pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars the chicken had dodged
* The chicken had 5263 feathers before its thrill-seeking road crossings

First, we calculate the number of feathers the chicken lost during the second crossing:
* The person pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars the chicken had dodged the first time
* 23 cars x 2 = 46 feathers

Now, we can calculate the total number of feathers the chicken had after the two road crossings:
* The chicken had 5263 feathers before the crossings
* It lost 46 feathers during the second crossing
* 5263 - 46 = 5217 feathers

Answer: 5217
