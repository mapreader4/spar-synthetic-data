Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim has 3 children
* They are out for 4 hours
* Each hour they visit 5 houses
* Each house gives 3 treats per kid

First, let's calculate the number of houses they visited in total:
* 4 hours x 5 houses per hour = 20 houses

Next, let's calculate the number of treats each child received:
* 20 houses x 3 treats per house = 60 treats per child

Finally, let's calculate the total number of treats the 3 children received:
* 60 treats per child x 3 children = 180 treats

Answer: 180
