Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The printing shop needs to ship 5000 brochures.
2) Each box can only contain one-fifth of the brochures.
3) To find the number of boxes needed, we need to divide the total number of brochures (5000) by the number of brochures that can fit in each box (one-fifth or 1/5).
4) 5000 brochures / (1/5 brochures per box) = 5000 * 5 = 25,000 boxes.

Answer: 25,000
