Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Christina has 3 snakes.
2) The first snake is 2 feet long.
   * 2 feet = 24 inches
3) The second snake is 16 inches long.
4) The third snake is 10 inches long.
5) To find the total length of all the snakes combined, we add up the lengths of the three snakes:
   * 24 inches + 16 inches + 10 inches = 50 inches

Answer: 50 inches
