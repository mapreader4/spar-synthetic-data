Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The keyboard is missing 1/7 of the consonants
* There are 21 consonants in the alphabet
* 1/7 of 21 is 3
* So the keyboard is missing 3 consonants

* The keyboard is also missing 2 vowels
* There are 5 vowels in the alphabet
* So the keyboard is missing 2 vowels

* To find the total number of keys missing, we add the missing consonants and missing vowels:
* 3 consonants + 2 vowels = 5 keys missing

Answer: 5
