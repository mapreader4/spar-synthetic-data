Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kingsley's teacher asked her to find 4 friends to help carry chairs
* Each student carried 5 chairs per trip
* They made a total of 10 trips

To find the total number of chairs taken to the hall, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of chairs carried per trip
2. Multiply the number of chairs per trip by the total number of trips

1. Number of chairs per trip:
   * 5 chairs per student
   * 5 students (Kingsley and her 4 friends)
   * 5 chairs per student x 5 students = 25 chairs per trip

2. Total number of trips:
   * 10 trips in total

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs taken to the hall:
* 25 chairs per trip x 10 trips = 250 chairs

Answer: 250
