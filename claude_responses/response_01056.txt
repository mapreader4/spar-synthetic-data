Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maria wants to cut up six times as many carrots as potatoes.
2) She has two potatoes, so she needs to cut up 6 x 2 = 12 carrots.
3) She wants to cut up twice as many onions as carrots.
4) So she needs to cut up 2 x 12 = 24 onions.
5) She wants to cut up 1/3 as many green beans as onions.
6) So she needs to cut up 1/3 x 24 = 8 green beans.
