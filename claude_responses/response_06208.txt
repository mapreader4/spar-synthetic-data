Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* One batch of cookies requires 4 cups of flour and 1.5 cups of sugar
* We need to find the total cups of flour and sugar needed for 8 batches
* For the flour:
  - 1 batch requires 4 cups of flour
  - 8 batches would require 8 * 4 = 32 cups of flour
* For the sugar:
  - 1 batch requires 1.5 cups of sugar
  - 8 batches would require 8 * 1.5 = 12 cups of sugar
* To find the total cups of flour and sugar combined:
  - 32 cups of flour + 12 cups of sugar = 44 cups total

Answer: 44
