Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Wallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's water heater.
2) The capacity of Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons.
3) Wallace's water heater is 3/4 full.
4) To find the amount of water in Wallace's water heater, we take the capacity (40 gallons) and multiply it by the fraction it is full (3/4):
   40 gallons * 3/4 = 30 gallons
5) Since Wallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's, Catherine's water heater capacity is 40 / 2 = 20 gallons.
6) Catherine's water heater is also 3/4 full.
7) To find the amount of water in Catherine's water heater, we take the capacity (20 gallons) and multiply it by the fraction it is full (3/4):
   20 gallons * 3/4 = 15 gallons
8) To find the total number of gallons of water they both have, we add the amount of water in Wallace's water heater (30 gallons) and the amount of water in Catherine's water heater (15 gallons):
   30 gallons + 15 gallons = 45 gallons

Answer: 45 gallons
