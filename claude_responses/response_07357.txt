Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The rectangular patch is 6 inches by 7 inches.
   * The area of the rectangular patch is 6 inches x 7 inches = 42 square inches.

2. The square path is 5 inches by 5 inches.
   * The area of the square path is 5 inches x 5 inches = 25 square inches.

3. It takes 3 grams of sand to fill one square inch.
   * For the rectangular patch, the amount of sand needed is 42 square inches x 3 grams/square inch = 126 grams.
   * For the square path, the amount of sand needed is 25 square inches x 3 grams/square inch = 75 grams.

4. The total amount of sand needed is the sum of the sand needed for the rectangular patch and the square path.
   * Total sand needed = 126 grams + 75 grams = 201 grams.

Answer: 201 grams.
