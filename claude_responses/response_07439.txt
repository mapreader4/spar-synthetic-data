Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) There are 96 oranges in total.
2) Half of the oranges were ripe, so there are 48 ripe oranges.
3) 1/4 of the ripe oranges were eaten, so 1/4 of 48 = 12 ripe oranges were eaten.
4) The remaining ripe oranges are 48 - 12 = 36.
5) 1/8 of the unripe oranges were eaten, so 1/8 of 48 = 6 unripe oranges were eaten.
6) The remaining unripe oranges are 48 - 6 = 42.
7) The total number of oranges left uneaten is 36 + 42 = 78.

Answer: 78
