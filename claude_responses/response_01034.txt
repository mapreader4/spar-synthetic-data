Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The ratio of sugar to cream cheese is 1:4. So, if Betty used 2 cups of sugar, that means she used 8 cups of cream cheese (2 cups * 4 = 8 cups).
2) The ratio of vanilla to cream cheese is 1 teaspoon per 2 cups of cream cheese. Since she used 8 cups of cream cheese, that means she used 4 teaspoons of vanilla (8 cups / 2 cups per teaspoon = 4 teaspoons).
3) The ratio of eggs to vanilla is 2 eggs per 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Since she used 4 teaspoons of vanilla, that means she used 8 eggs (4 teaspoons * 2 eggs per teaspoon = 8 eggs).

Answer: 8 eggs.
