Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Angie's monthly salary is $80
* She contributes $42 a month for necessities
* At the end of the month, she had $18 left over
* To find how much she paid in taxes, we need to subtract her contribution to necessities and the amount she had left over from her total salary

First, let's calculate her total expenses:
* Contribution to necessities: $42
* Amount left over: $18
* Total expenses: $42 + $18 = $60

Now, we can calculate her taxes by subtracting her total expenses from her total salary:
* Total salary: $80
* Total expenses: $60
* Taxes paid: $80 - $60 = $20

Answer: $20
