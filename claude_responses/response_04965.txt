Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 2 shirts.
2) The first shirt costs $6 more than the second shirt.
3) The first shirt costs $15.
4) Since the first shirt costs $6 more than the second shirt, we can calculate the cost of the second shirt:
   * Cost of second shirt = Cost of first shirt - $6
   * Cost of second shirt = $15 - $6 = $9
5) Now we can calculate the total cost of the two shirts:
   * Total cost = Cost of first shirt + Cost of second shirt
   * Total cost = $15 + $9 = $24

Answer: $24
