Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janet has 1/3 of a bottle of rose shampoo and 1/4 of a bottle of jasmine shampoo.
2) She uses 1/12 of a bottle of shampoo per day.
3) To find the total amount of shampoo she has, we add the rose and jasmine shampoo:
1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 of a bottle of shampoo.
4) Now, we need to find how many days the 7/12 of a bottle of shampoo will last, given that she uses 1/12 of a bottle per day.
5) 7/12 of a bottle divided by 1/12 of a bottle per day = 7 days.

Answer: 7
