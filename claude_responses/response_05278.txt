Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The box has 2 dozen water bottles
* 1 dozen = 12 bottles
* So, 2 dozen water bottles = 2 x 12 = 24 water bottles
* The box also has half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles
* Half a dozen = 6 / 2 = 3 bottles
* So, the box has 24 + 3 = 27 bottles

Answer: 27
