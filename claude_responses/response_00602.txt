Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The publishing house is awarding a total of $800 in prizes
* There are 18 novels that will receive prizes
* The first place winner will receive $200
* The second place winner will receive $150
* The third place winner will receive $120
* The remaining 15 prizes will be awarded with the same amount of money

To calculate the amount each writer will earn from fourth place onwards, we need to first calculate the total amount of money awarded to the top 3 places:
* $200 + $150 + $120 = $470

Now, we can calculate the remaining amount of money to be awarded to the other 15 writers:
* $800 - $470 = $330

Since the remaining 15 prizes will be awarded with the same amount of money, we can divide the remaining $330 by 15 to get the amount each writer will earn from fourth place onwards:
* $330 / 15 = $22

Answer: $22
