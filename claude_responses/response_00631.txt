Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary bought 2 pairs of sunglasses at $50 each, so that's 2 x $50 = $100 for the sunglasses.
* Mary also bought a pair of jeans for $100.
* So the total amount Mary spent is $100 + $100 = $200.
* Since Mary and Rose spent the same amount, Rose also spent $200.
* Rose bought a pair of shoes for $150.
* So the remaining amount Rose spent must have been on the two decks of basketball cards.
* The remaining amount is $200 - $150 = $50.
* Since Rose bought two decks of basketball cards, and the total amount spent on the cards was $50, each deck of basketball cards must have cost $50 / 2 = $25.

Answer: $25
