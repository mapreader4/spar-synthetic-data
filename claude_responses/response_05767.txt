Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jefferson has 56 bananas.
2) Walter has 1/4 times fewer bananas than Jefferson.
3) To find how many bananas Walter has, we take Jefferson's 56 bananas and divide by 4 (since Walter has 1/4 times fewer).
4) 56 รท 4 = 14 bananas.
5) If Jefferson and Walter combine their bananas and share them equally, they will each get half of the total.
6) The total number of bananas is 56 + 14 = 70.
7) 70 รท 2 = 35 bananas each.

Answer: 35
