Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Gretchen can carry 3 objects at a time while swimming underwater
* She has found 17 objects underwater
* We need to find the fewest number of trips she must take to the surface to carry all 17 objects to the boat

To do this, we can divide the total number of objects (17) by the number of objects she can carry at a time (3):
* 17 objects / 3 objects per trip = 5.67 trips

Since we can't take a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to get the fewest number of trips:
* 5.67 trips rounded up to the nearest whole number is 6 trips

Therefore, the fewest number of trips Gretchen must take to the surface of the water to carry all 17 objects to the boat is:
Answer: 6
