Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Beatrice looked at 8 TVs at one store in person
* She then looked at three times as many TVs at an online store
* 3 x 8 = 24 TVs at the online store
* In total, she looked at 8 + 24 = 32 TVs so far
* She looked at 42 TVs in all
* To find how many she looked at on the auction site, we subtract the number of TVs she looked at in person and online from the total:
* 42 - 32 = 10 TVs on the auction site

Answer: 10
