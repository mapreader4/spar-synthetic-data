Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sandi had $600 to start with.
2) Sandi spent half of her $600, which is $300.
3) Gillian spent $150 more than three times Sandi's total.
4) Sandi's total after spending $300 is $600 - $300 = $300.
5) Three times Sandi's total is 3 * $300 = $900.
6) Gillian spent $150 more than $900, which is $900 + $150 = $1,050.

Answer: $1,050
