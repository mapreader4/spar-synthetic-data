Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Natasha has 3 times as much money as Carla, so if Natasha has $60, then Carla has $60 / 3 = $20.
2) Carla has twice as much money as Cosima, so if Carla has $20, then Cosima has $20 / 2 = $10.
3) The total amount of money the three have is $60 + $20 + $10 = $90.
4) They decide to buy goods worth the total amount they have, which is $90.
5) They then sell the goods at 7/5 of the buying price. The selling price is 7/5 * $90 = $126.
6) The profit they make is the selling price minus the buying price, which is $126 - $90 = $36.

Answer: $36
