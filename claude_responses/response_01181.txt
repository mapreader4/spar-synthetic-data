Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mr. Fletcher hired 2 men to dig a well
* On the first day, they worked for 10 hours
* On the second day, they worked for 8 hours
* On the third day, they worked for 15 hours
* Each man was paid $10 per hour of work

To calculate the total amount of money they received, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each man
2. Multiply the total hours worked by each man by the hourly rate of $10
3. Multiply the result by 2, since there are 2 men

Let's start with step 1:
* Total hours worked by each man = 10 + 8 + 15 = 33 hours

Now step 2:
* Total pay for each man = 33 hours x $10 per hour = $330

Finally, step 3:
* Total pay for both men = $330 x 2 = $660

Answer: $660
