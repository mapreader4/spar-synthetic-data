Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The merchant bought 15 keyboards and 25 printers
* The total cost of the 15 keyboards and 25 printers is $2050
* We know that each keyboard costs $20
* To find the cost of each printer, we can set up an equation:
* Let x = the cost of each printer
* Total cost = (15 * $20) + (25 * x)
* $2050 = $300 + 25x
* Solving for x, we get:
* $2050 - $300 = 25x
* $1750 = 25x
* x = $70
* Therefore, each printer costs $70.

Answer: $70
