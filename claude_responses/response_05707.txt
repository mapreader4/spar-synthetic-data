Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Max has 20 red stamps, 80 blue stamps, and 7 yellow stamps
* He sold 20 red stamps for $1.1 each, so he earned 20 * $1.1 = $22 from the red stamps
* He sold 80 blue stamps for $0.8 each, so he earned 80 * $0.8 = $64 from the blue stamps
* The total amount he has earned so far is $22 + $64 = $86
* He wants to earn a total of $100 from the whole sale
* To calculate the price he needs to set for each yellow stamp, we need to find the remaining amount he needs to earn, which is $100 - $86 = $14
* He has 7 yellow stamps, so the price he needs to set for each yellow stamp is $14 / 7 = $2
