Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bob orders a dozen muffins a day, which is 12 muffins.
* He buys each muffin for $0.75.
* So, the total cost of the muffins he buys in a day is:
    * 12 muffins x $0.75 per muffin = $9.00
* He sells each muffin for $1.5.
* So, the total revenue he makes in a day is:
    * 12 muffins x $1.5 per muffin = $18.00
* The profit he makes in a day is the difference between the revenue and the cost:
    * $18.00 - $9.00 = $9.00
* In a week, there are 7 days.
* So, the total profit he makes in a week is:
    * $9.00 per day x 7 days = $63.00

Answer: $63
