Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jairus read 20 pages of the newspaper.
2) Arniel read 2 more than twice the number of pages Jairus read.
   * Twice the number of pages Jairus read is 2 x 20 = 40 pages.
   * Arniel read 2 more than 40 pages, which is 42 pages.
3) To find the total number of pages they have read altogether, we add Jairus' 20 pages and Arniel's 42 pages.
   * 20 pages + 42 pages = 62 pages.

Answer: 62
