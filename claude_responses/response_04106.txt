Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Solomon collected 3 times as many cans as Juwan. So if Solomon collected 66 cans, then Juwan must have collected 66 / 3 = 22 cans.
2) Levi collected half of what Juwan collected, so Levi collected 22 / 2 = 11 cans.
3) To find the total number of cans collected by the boys, we add up the cans collected by each boy:
Solomon: 66 cans
Juwan: 22 cans
Levi: 11 cans
Total cans collected = 66 + 22 + 11 = 99 cans

Answer: 99
