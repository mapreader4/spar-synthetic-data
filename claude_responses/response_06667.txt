Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Rachel writes 1 page every 30 minutes
* She writes a total of 6 pages
* So, to write the 6 pages, she would spend:
  * 6 pages x 30 minutes/page = 180 minutes
  * 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours
* She also spends 45 minutes researching the topic
* And she spends 75 minutes editing the essay
* So, the total time spent on the essay is:
  * 3 hours (writing) + 0.75 hours (researching) + 1.25 hours (editing) = 5 hours

Answer: 5 hours
