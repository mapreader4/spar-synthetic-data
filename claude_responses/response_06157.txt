Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The magician has performed the disappearing act 100 times this year
* One-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears
* One-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of one

First, let's calculate the number of times the audience member never reappeared:
* 100 performances * 1/10 = 10 times the audience member never reappeared

Next, let's calculate the number of times two people reappeared:
* 100 performances * 1/5 = 20 times two people reappeared

Now, let's calculate the number of times one person reappeared:
* 100 performances - 10 times no one reappeared - 20 times two people reappeared = 70 times one person reappeared

Finally, let's add up the total number of people who reappeared:
* 70 times one person reappeared + 20 times two people reappeared = 110 people reappeared

Answer: 110
