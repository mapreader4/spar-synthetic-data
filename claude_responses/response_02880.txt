Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) The nail salon was completely booked at 2 pm for manicures.
2) Each manicure costs $20.00 per client.
3) The salon made $200.00 in total.
4) There are 210 fingers in the salon at 2 pm.
5) Everyone has 10 fingers.
6) To find the number of people in the salon, we divide the total number of fingers (210) by the number of fingers per person (10).
7) 210 fingers / 10 fingers per person = 21 people in the salon.
8) The salon made $200.00 in total, and each manicure costs $20.00 per client.
9) To find the number of clients, we divide the total revenue ($200.00) by the cost per manicure ($20.00).
10) $200.00 / $20.00 per manicure = 10 clients.
11) Therefore, the number of people in the salon who are not clients is 21 - 10 = 11.

Answer: 11
