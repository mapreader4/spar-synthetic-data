Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Day 1:
* James visits 20 houses
* He makes a sale in every house
* So, he sold 20 items on Day 1

Day 2:
* James visits twice as many houses as Day 1, which is 40 houses
* He sold to 80% of the houses
* 80% of 40 houses = 32 houses
* He sold 2 items at each of the 32 houses
* So, he sold 32 x 2 = 64 items on Day 2

Total items sold:
* Day 1: 20 items
* Day 2: 64 items
* Total items sold = 20 + 64 = 84 items

Answer: 84
