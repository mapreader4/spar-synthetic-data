Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) On the first day, there were 1500 surfers at the Festival.

2) On the second day, there were 600 more surfers than the first day. So, the number of surfers on the second day was 1500 + 600 = 2100.

3) On the third day, there were 2/5 as many surfers as the first day. So, the number of surfers on the third day was 1500 * 2/5 = 600.

4) To find the average number of surfers for the three days, we add up the number of surfers for each day and divide by 3:
(1500 + 2100 + 600) / 3 = 4200 / 3 = 1400

Answer: 1400
