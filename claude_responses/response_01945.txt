Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Diego can carry 20 pounds of fruit in his bookbag
* He buys:
  - 1 pound of watermelon
  - 1 pound of grapes
  - 1 pound of oranges
* To calculate how many pounds of apples he can buy, we need to subtract the weight of the other fruits from the total weight he can carry:
  - Total weight he can carry: 20 pounds
  - Weight of watermelon, grapes, and oranges: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 pounds
  - Remaining weight he can carry for apples: 20 - 3 = 17 pounds
Answer: 17 pounds
