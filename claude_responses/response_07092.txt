Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Jon's textbooks weigh three times as much as Brandon's textbooks.
2) Jon has 4 textbooks that weigh 2 lbs, 8 lbs, 5 lbs, and 9 lbs respectively.
3) To find the total weight of Jon's textbooks, we add up the weights of the 4 textbooks:
2 lbs + 8 lbs + 5 lbs + 9 lbs = 24 lbs
4) Since Jon's textbooks weigh three times as much as Brandon's textbooks, we can divide the total weight of Jon's textbooks by 3 to find the total weight of Brandon's textbooks:
24 lbs / 3 = 8 lbs
Answer: 8 lbs
