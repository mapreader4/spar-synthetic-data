Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) James has 5 hives, and each hive produces 20 liters of honey.
2) So the total amount of honey produced is 5 hives x 20 liters per hive = 100 liters of honey.
3) Each jar can hold 0.5 liters of honey.
4) James' friend is bringing his own jars for half the honey, so James only needs to buy jars for half the honey, which is 100 liters / 2 = 50 liters of honey.
5) To calculate the number of jars James needs to buy, we divide the total honey he needs to store (50 liters) by the capacity of each jar (0.5 liters).
6) 50 liters / 0.5 liters per jar = 100 jars.

Answer: 100
