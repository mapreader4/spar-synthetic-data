Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The Indigo Restaurant receives a total of 18 online customer reviews.
2) They receive:
   - 6 reviews with 5 stars
   - 7 reviews with 4 stars
   - 4 reviews with 3 stars
   - 1 review with 2 stars
3) To calculate the average star rating, we need to find the total number of stars received and divide it by the total number of reviews.
4) The total number of stars received is:
   - 6 reviews x 5 stars = 30 stars
   - 7 reviews x 4 stars = 28 stars
   - 4 reviews x 3 stars = 12 stars
   - 1 review x 2 stars = 2 stars
   - Total stars = 30 + 28 + 12 + 2 = 72 stars
5) The total number of reviews is 18.
6) The average star rating is 72 stars / 18 reviews = 4 stars.
