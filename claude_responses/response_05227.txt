Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Julian has 400 legos.
2) He wants to make two identical airplane models.
3) Each airplane model requires 240 legos.
4) To calculate the total number of legos needed for the two airplane models, we multiply 240 by 2:
240 legos per model x 2 models = 480 legos
5) To find out how many more legos Julian needs, we subtract the number of legos he has (400) from the total number of legos needed (480):
480 legos needed - 400 legos he has = 80 more legos needed.

Answer: 80
