Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 6 chairs in each row in the church.
2) There are 20 rows of chairs in the church.
3) Each chair holds 5 people.
4) To calculate the total number of people who can sit in the chairs, we need to:
   a) Multiply the number of chairs in each row (6) by the number of rows (20) to get the total number of chairs: 6 * 20 = 120 chairs.
   b) Multiply the number of people each chair can hold (5) by the total number of chairs (120) to get the total number of people who can sit in the chairs: 120 * 5 = 600 people.

Answer: 600
