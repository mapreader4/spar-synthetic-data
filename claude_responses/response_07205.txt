Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Marc bought 5 model cars that cost $20 each
* 5 model cars x $20 per car = $100 for the model cars
* Marc also bought 5 bottles of paint that cost $10 each
* 5 bottles of paint x $10 per bottle = $50 for the paint
* Finally, Marc bought 5 paintbrushes that cost $2 each
* 5 paintbrushes x $2 per paintbrush = $10 for the paintbrushes
* To calculate the total amount Marc spent, we add up the costs for the model cars, paint, and paintbrushes:
* $100 + $50 + $10 = $160

Answer: 160
