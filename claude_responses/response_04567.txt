Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bookshop initially had 743 books in their store.
* On Saturday, they sold 37 books in-store and 128 books online.
* So the total number of books sold on Saturday was 37 + 128 = 165 books.
* On Sunday, they sold twice as many books in-store, which is 2 * 37 = 74 books.
* They also increased their online sales by 34 books, so the total online sales on Sunday was 128 + 34 = 162 books.
* The total number of books sold on Sunday was 74 + 162 = 236 books.
* They also received a shipment of 160 books.

Now, to calculate the current number of books they have:
* Initial number of books: 743
* Books sold on Saturday: 165
* Books sold on Sunday: 236
* Books received in shipment: 160
* Current number of books = 743 - 165 - 236 + 160 = 502

Answer: 502
