Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Francine caught a total of 5 + 2 + 2 + 18 = 27 frogs.
2) Out of the 27 frogs, 5 have extra legs, 2 have 2 heads, and 2 are bright red. This means a total of 5 + 2 + 2 = 9 frogs are mutated.
3) To calculate the percentage of mutated frogs, we divide the number of mutated frogs by the total number of frogs and multiply by 100:
(9 / 27) * 100 = 33.33%
4) Rounding this to the nearest integer, we get:
Answer: 33%
