Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Ivan has two piggy banks, each of which can hold 100 pennies and 50 dimes.
2) In the first piggy bank, Ivan has 100 pennies and 50 dimes.
3) The value of 100 pennies is $1.00.
4) The value of 50 dimes is $5.00.
5) The total value of the first piggy bank is $1.00 + $5.00 = $6.00.
6) In the second piggy bank, Ivan also has 100 pennies and 50 dimes.
7) The total value of the second piggy bank is also $6.00.
8) The total value of both piggy banks is $6.00 + $6.00 = $12.00.

Answer: $12
