Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sally bought 3 photograph frames
* Each frame cost $3
* So the total cost of the 3 frames is:
  * 3 frames x $3 per frame = $9
* Sally paid with a $20 bill
* To calculate the change she received, we take the amount she paid ($20) and subtract the total cost ($9):
  * $20 - $9 = $11
