Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculating the cost of the broccoli:
   * 3 pounds of broccoli at $4 per pound
   * 3 x $4 = $12

2. Calculating the cost of the oranges:
   * 3 oranges at $0.75 each
   * 3 x $0.75 = $2.25

3. Calculating the cost of the cabbage:
   * 1 cabbage for $3.75

4. Calculating the cost of the bacon:
   * 1 pound of bacon for $3

5. Calculating the cost of the chicken:
   * 2 pounds of chicken at $3 per pound
   * 2 x $3 = $6

6. Calculating the total grocery cost:
   * $12 (broccoli) + $2.25 (oranges) + $3.75 (cabbage) + $3 (bacon) + $6 (chicken) = $27

7. Calculating the cost of the meat:
   * $3 (bacon) + $6 (chicken) = $9

8. Calculating the percentage of the grocery budget spent on meat:
   * Meat cost / Total grocery cost x 100 = $9 / $27 x 100 = 33.33%

Rounding to the nearest percent:
Answer: 33%
