Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Carter scores an average of 4 goals per game.
2. Shelby scores half as many goals as Carter per game, which means Shelby scores an average of 2 goals per game (4 / 2 = 2).
3. Judah scores an average of three less than twice as many goals as Shelby per game. So, Judah scores an average of 3 goals per game (2 x 2 - 3 = 3).

Now, to find the average total number of goals scored by the team per game, we add up the goals scored by each player:
Carter: 4 goals
Shelby: 2 goals
Judah: 3 goals

Total goals scored per game = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9 goals

Answer: 9
