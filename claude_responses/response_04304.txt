Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Rachel is 12 years old
2) Her grandfather is 7 times her age, so his age is 7 * 12 = 84 years old
3) Her mother is half of her grandfather's age, so her mother's age is 84 / 2 = 42 years old
4) Her father is 5 years older than her mother, so his age is 42 + 5 = 47 years old
5) When Rachel is 25 years old, she will be 25 - 12 = 13 years older than she is now
6) Therefore, her father will be 47 + 13 = 60 years old when Rachel is 25 years old.

Answer: 60
