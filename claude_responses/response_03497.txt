Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Emma can run around the two arenas in 20 hours
* Fernando takes twice as long as Emma to run his course
* If Emma can run the two arenas in 20 hours, then it takes Fernando 40 hours to run the two arenas (2 x 20 hours)
* To find the total time it takes both of them to run all around the two arenas, we add Emma's time and Fernando's time:
* Emma's time: 20 hours
* Fernando's time: 40 hours
* Total time: 20 hours + 40 hours = 60 hours

Answer: 60 hours
