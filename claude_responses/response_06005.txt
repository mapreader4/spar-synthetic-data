Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The building has 25 stories
* Each floor has 4 apartments
* Each apartment houses 2 people

To find the total number of people in the building, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the building
2. Multiply the total number of apartments by the number of people per apartment

Step 1: Calculating the total number of apartments
* There are 4 apartments per floor
* There are 25 floors in the building
* Total number of apartments = 4 apartments per floor x 25 floors = 100 apartments

Step 2: Multiplying the total number of apartments by the number of people per apartment
* Each apartment houses 2 people
* Total number of people = 100 apartments x 2 people per apartment = 200 people

Answer: 200
