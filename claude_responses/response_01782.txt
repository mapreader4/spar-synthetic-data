Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* A burger costs $9
* A pizza costs twice as much as a burger, which means a pizza costs $18 (2 x $9)
* We want to find the cost of one pizza and three burgers
* The cost of one pizza is $18
* The cost of three burgers is 3 x $9 = $27
* To find the total cost, we add the cost of the pizza and the cost of the three burgers:
* $18 + $27 = $45

Answer: $45
