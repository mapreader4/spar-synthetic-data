Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Job 1:
* 3 toilets at $50 each = $150
* 3 sinks at $30 each = $90
* Total for Job 1 = $150 + $90 = $240

Job 2:
* 2 toilets at $50 each = $100
* 5 sinks at $30 each = $150
* Total for Job 2 = $100 + $150 = $250

Job 3:
* 1 toilet at $50 = $50
* 2 showers at $40 each = $80
* 3 sinks at $30 each = $90
* Total for Job 3 = $50 + $80 + $90 = $220

The most money the plumber can earn is by taking Job 2, which pays $250.

Answer: 250
