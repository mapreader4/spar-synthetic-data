Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 5 toys
2) Each toy costs $3
3) So the total cost of the 5 toys without any discount would be:
   5 toys x $3 per toy = $15
4) John gets a 20% discount
5) To calculate the discount, we take 20% of the total cost:
   20% of $15 = 0.20 x $15 = $3
6) The total cost after the 20% discount would be the original cost minus the discount:
   $15 - $3 = $12
Answer: $12
