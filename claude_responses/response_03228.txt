Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For breakfast, Daisy bought:
* Muffin: $2
* Coffee: $4
Total spent on breakfast: $2 + $4 = $6

For lunch, Daisy bought:
* Soup: $3
* Salad: $5.25
* Lemonade: $0.75
Total spent on lunch: $3 + $5.25 + $0.75 = $9

To find how much more Daisy spent on lunch than on breakfast, we subtract the total spent on breakfast from the total spent on lunch:
* $9 - $6 = $3

Answer: $3
