Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Terese runs on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
2) On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles.
3) On Tuesday, she runs 3.8 miles.
4) On Wednesday, she runs 3.6 miles.
5) On Thursday, she runs 4.4 miles.
6) To find the average distance she runs on each of the days, we need to add up the total distance and divide by the number of days she ran.
7) The total distance is 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles.
8) She ran on 4 days, so we divide the total distance by 4 to get the average distance per day.
9) 16 miles / 4 days = 4 miles per day.
