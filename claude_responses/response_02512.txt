Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Scott buys 5 pounds of eggplants and 4 pounds of zucchini at $2.00 per pound. That's a total of 9 pounds at $2.00 per pound, so the cost for the eggplants and zucchini is 9 x $2.00 = $18.00.
* He needs 4 pounds of tomatoes at $3.50 per pound, so the cost for the tomatoes is 4 x $3.50 = $14.00.
* He needs 3 pounds of onions at $1.00 per pound, so the cost for the onions is 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.
* He needs 1 pound of basil, which is sold for $2.50 per half pound. So the cost for the basil is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.
* The total cost of all the ingredients is $18.00 + $14.00 + $3.00 + $5.00 = $40.00.
* This batch of ratatouille yields 4 quarts.
* To calculate the cost per quart, we divide the total cost of $40.00 by the 4 quarts, which gives us $10.00 per quart.

Answer: $10.00
