Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark has 3 tanks for pregnant fish
* Each tank has 4 pregnant fish
* Each pregnant fish gives birth to 20 young

To calculate the total number of young fish, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of young fish in each tank
2. Add up the number of young fish from all 3 tanks

Step 1: Number of young fish in each tank
* Each tank has 4 pregnant fish
* Each pregnant fish gives birth to 20 young
* So, the number of young fish in each tank is 4 x 20 = 80

Step 2: Total number of young fish
* There are 3 tanks
* Each tank has 80 young fish
* So, the total number of young fish is 3 x 80 = 240

Answer: 240
