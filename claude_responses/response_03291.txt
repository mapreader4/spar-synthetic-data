Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total amount that everyone has promised to contribute is $400
* Rick has actually received $285 so far
* This means that the total amount still owed is $400 - $285 = $115
* We know that:
  - Sally and Carl both owe equal amounts
  - Amy owes $30
  - Derek owes half as much as Amy
* Since Derek owes half as much as Amy, and Amy owes $30, then Derek owes $30 / 2 = $15
* The total amount still owed is $115, and we know that Amy owes $30 and Derek owes $15
* This means that the remaining amount owed by Sally and Carl must be $115 - $30 - $15 = $70
* Since Sally and Carl both owe equal amounts, that means they each owe $70 / 2 = $35

Answer: $35
