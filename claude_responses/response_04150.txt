Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Mrs. Thomson received an incentive worth $240.
2) She spent 1/3 of the money on food. 1/3 of $240 is $80, so she spent $80 on food.
3) She spent 1/5 of the money on clothes. 1/5 of $240 is $48, so she spent $48 on clothes.
4) The remaining money is $240 - $80 - $48 = $112.
5) She put 3/4 of the remaining money ($112) into her savings account. 3/4 of $112 is $84.
Answer: $84
