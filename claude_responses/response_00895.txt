Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The living room walls take up 600 square feet.
2) Henrietta has three bedrooms, and each bedroom's walls take up 400 square feet.
3) So the total square feet of wall space in the bedrooms is 3 * 400 = 1200 square feet.
4) The total square feet of wall space in the house is the living room (600 square feet) plus the three bedrooms (1200 square feet), which is 600 + 1200 = 1800 square feet.
5) One gallon of paint can cover 600 square feet.
6) To calculate the number of gallons of paint needed, we divide the total square feet of wall space (1800) by the square feet that one gallon can cover (600).
7) 1800 / 600 = 3
