Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The shoes were marked 75% off, which means the current price is 25% of the original price.
2) The current price of the shoes is $51.
3) To find the original price, we need to find the value that is 25% of itself.
4) Let's call the original price "x".
5) 25% of x = $51
6) 0.25x = $51
7) x = $51 / 0.25
8) x = $204

Answer: 204
