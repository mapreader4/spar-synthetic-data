Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Joe buys 3 oranges, each costing $4.50. So the total cost of the oranges is:
   3 oranges x $4.50 per orange = $13.50

2. Joe buys 7 juices, each costing 50 cents. So the total cost of the juices is:
   7 juices x $0.50 per juice = $3.50

3. Joe buys 3 jars of honey, each costing $5. So the total cost of the honey is:
   3 jars x $5 per jar = $15

4. Joe buys 4 plants, which are 2 for $18. So the total cost of the plants is:
   4 plants / 2 plants per $18 = 2 sets x $18 per set = $36

5. To calculate the total amount Joe spent at the market, we add up the costs of all the items:
   $13.50 + $3.50 + $15 + $36 = $68

Answer: $68
