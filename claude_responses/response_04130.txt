Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year compared to last year
* This 60 pounds is 3 times as much as he could lift last year
* So, if 60 pounds is 3 times as much as he could lift last year, then last year he could lift 60 / 3 = 20 pounds
* This year, he can lift 20 + 60 = 80 pounds

Answer: 80 pounds
