Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The video game costs $60
* Ronald and Max are selling ice cream for $5 each
* We need to find how many ice creams they need to sell to afford the $60 game

To calculate this, we need to divide the cost of the game ($60) by the price of each ice cream ($5):
* $60 / $5 = 12

Therefore, Ronald and Max will need to sell 12 ice creams in order to afford the $60 video game.

Answer: 12
