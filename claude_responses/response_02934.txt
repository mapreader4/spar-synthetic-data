Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mary has 8 screws on hand.
2) She needs to buy 2 times more screws to fix her sink.
   - 2 times 8 screws = 16 more screws
   - So the total number of screws she will have is 8 + 16 = 24 screws.
3) She has to split the screws into four sections.
   - To split 24 screws into four sections, we divide 24 by 4.
   - 24 รท 4 = 6
Answer: 6 screws in each pile.
