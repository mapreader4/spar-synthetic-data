Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Erica gets an ice cream treat 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
* The orange creamsicle costs $2.00 each time
* So for the 3 days a week she gets the orange creamsicle, the cost is:
  * 3 days/week x $2.00 = $6.00/week
* Erica also gets an ice cream sandwich 2 days a week (Tuesday, Thursday)
* The ice cream sandwich costs $1.50 each time
* So for the 2 days a week she gets the ice cream sandwich, the cost is:
  * 2 days/week x $1.50 = $3.00/week
* Erica also gets a Nutty-Buddy 2 days a week (Saturday, Sunday)
* The Nutty-Buddy costs $3.00 each time
* So for the 2 days a week she gets the Nutty-Buddy, the cost is:
  * 2 days/week x $3.00 = $6.00/week
* To calculate the total cost over 6 weeks:
  * $6.00/week x 6 weeks = $36.00 for the orange creamsicles
  * $3.00/week x 6 weeks = $18.00 for the ice cream sandwiches
  * $6.00/week x 6 weeks = $36.00 for the Nutty-Buddies
  * Total cost = $36.00 + $18.00 + $36.00 = $90.00
