Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Daphney buys 5 kg of potatoes
* We know that 2 kg of potatoes costs $6
* To find the cost of 5 kg of potatoes, we need to set up a proportion:
* 2 kg of potatoes = $6
* 5 kg of potatoes = x
* Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 2x = 30
* Solving for x, we get:
* x = 15
* Therefore, Daphney will pay $15 for 5 kg of potatoes.

Answer: 15
