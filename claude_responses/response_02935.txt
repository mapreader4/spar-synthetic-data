Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Edward had $17.80 to spend at the toy store.
2) He bought 4 toy cars that cost $0.95 each.
   * 4 toy cars x $0.95 each = $3.80
3) He also bought a race track that cost $6.00.
4) To calculate the total amount he spent:
   * $3.80 (for the toy cars) + $6.00 (for the race track) = $9.80
5) Now, to calculate how much money Edward has left:
   * $17.80 (original amount) - $9.80 (amount spent) = $8.00

Answer: $8
