Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Angela has half as many insects as Jacob.
2) Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean.
3) Dean has 30 insects.

First, let's find out how many insects Jacob has:
* Dean has 30 insects
* Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean
* Therefore, Jacob has 5 x 30 = 150 insects

Now, let's find out how many insects Angela has:
* Angela has half as many insects as Jacob
* Jacob has 150 insects
* Therefore, Angela has 150 / 2 = 75 insects

Answer: 75
