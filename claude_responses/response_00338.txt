Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Bobby had 12 gallons of gasoline to start with.
* He drove 5 miles to the supermarket and then 5 miles back home, for a total of 10 miles.
* He then drove 6 miles to the farm, and 2 miles back home, for a total of 8 miles.
* So the total distance he drove was 10 + 8 = 18 miles.
* He now has 2 gallons of gasoline left.
* To find the rate of gasoline consumption, we divide the total distance by the amount of gasoline used.
* The amount of gasoline used is 12 gallons - 2 gallons = 10 gallons.
* Therefore, the rate of gasoline consumption is 18 miles / 10 gallons = 1.8 miles per gallon.

Answer: 1.8 miles per gallon.
