Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Last week, Arman worked:
* 35 hours per day for 5 days
* At $10 per hour
* So, his earnings last week were: 35 hours x 5 days x $10 per hour = $1,750

This week, Arman will receive an increase of $0.5 per hour if he can work for 40 hours.
* His new hourly rate will be $10 + $0.5 = $10.5 per hour
* If he works 40 hours this week, his earnings will be: 40 hours x $10.5 per hour = $420

To calculate his total earnings for two weeks:
* Last week's earnings: $1,750
* This week's earnings: $420
* Total earnings for two weeks: $1,750 + $420 = $2,170

Answer: $2,170
