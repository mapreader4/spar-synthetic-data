Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 25 people on the dance team
* 8 people quit the team
* So, the number of people on the team after the 8 people quit is 25 - 8 = 17
* Then, 13 new people got in
* So, the new total number of people on the team is 17 + 13 = 30

Answer: 30
