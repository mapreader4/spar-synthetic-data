Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Janet buys 45-pound containers of cat litter for $21 each.
2) Her cat litter box holds 15 pounds of cat litter.
3) She changes out the litter weekly.
4) We need to find how much it will cost for her to buy enough litter to last 210 days.
5) First, let's calculate how much litter she needs per week:
   - Her litter box holds 15 pounds
   - She changes it weekly, so she needs 15 pounds per week
6) Now, let's calculate how much litter she needs for 210 days:
   - 210 days / 7 days per week = 30 weeks
   - 30 weeks * 15 pounds per week = 450 pounds of litter needed
7) Each container holds 45 pounds of litter, so she needs to buy:
   - 450 pounds / 45 pounds per container = 10 containers
8) Each container costs $21, so the total cost will be:
   - 10 containers * $21 per container = $210

Answer: $210
