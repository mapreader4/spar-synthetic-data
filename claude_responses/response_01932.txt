Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each football team member must pay $40 to get admission into the school party.
* There are 60 players on the football team.
* The entire team attends 8 such parties in a year.

To calculate the total amount of money collected in the 8 parties, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount of money collected in one party.
2. Multiply the total amount collected in one party by the number of parties (8).

Step 1: Total amount collected in one party
* Each player pays $40 to attend the party.
* There are 60 players on the team.
* Total amount collected in one party = 60 players x $40 per player = $2,400

Step 2: Total amount collected in 8 parties
* Total amount collected in one party = $2,400
* Number of parties = 8
* Total amount collected in 8 parties = $2,400 x 8 = $19,200

Answer: $19,200
