Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tina has 12 pink pens.
2) She has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. So, if she has 12 pink pens, she must have 12 - 9 = 3 green pens.
3) Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. So, if she has 3 green pens, she must have 3 + 3 = 6 blue pens.
4) To find the total number of pens Tina has, we add up the number of pink, green, and blue pens:
12 pink pens + 3 green pens + 6 blue pens = 21 pens.

Answer: 21
