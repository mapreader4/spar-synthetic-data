Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* James has 3 gallons of milk
* There are 128 ounces in a gallon
* So, the total amount of milk James has is:
    - 3 gallons x 128 ounces/gallon = 384 ounces
* James drank 13 ounces of the milk
* To find the amount of milk James has left, we subtract the amount he drank from the total amount:
    - 384 ounces - 13 ounces = 371 ounces

Answer: 371 ounces
