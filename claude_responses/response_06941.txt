Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total number of people in the church was 200
* The number of children present was 80
* The number of male adults present was 60
* To find the number of female adults, we need to subtract the number of children and male adults from the total number of people

First, let's calculate the total number of adults:
* Total number of people = 200
* Number of children = 80
* Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of children
* Number of adults = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know the number of male adults is 60, so the number of female adults must be the remaining adults:
* Number of female adults = Total number of adults - Number of male adults
* Number of female adults = 120 - 60 = 60

Answer: 60
