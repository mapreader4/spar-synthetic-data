Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The MRI cost $1200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and needs to examine the MRI for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
3. The doctor's fee is therefore 0.5 hours x $300/hour = $150.
4. There is also a $150 fee just for being seen.
5. The total cost before insurance is:
   - MRI: $1200
   - Doctor's fee: $150
   - Exam fee: $150
   - Total: $1200 + $150 + $150 = $1500

6. The insurance covered 80% of the total cost.
7. The amount Tim had to pay is 20% of the total cost.
8. 20% of $1500 is 0.2 x $1500 = $300.

Answer: $300
