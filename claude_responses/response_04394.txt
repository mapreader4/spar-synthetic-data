Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Dan's skateboarding helmet has 10 more craters than Daniel's ski helmet.
2) Rin's snorkel helmet has 15 more craters than Dan's and Daniel's helmets combined.
3) Rin's helmet has 75 craters.
4) Let's call the number of craters in Daniel's helmet x.
5) Then, the number of craters in Dan's helmet is x + 10.
6) The number of craters in Rin's helmet is 15 more than the combined number of craters in Dan's and Daniel's helmets.
7) So, the combined number of craters in Dan's and Daniel's helmets is 75 - 15 = 60.
8) Therefore, x + (x + 10) = 60.
9) Solving for x, we get 2x + 10 = 60, so 2x = 50, and x = 25.
10) Therefore, the number of craters in Dan's helmet is x + 10 = 25 + 10 = 35.

Answer: 35
