Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John buys 500 newspapers, and each newspaper sells for $2.
2) He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which means he sells 400 newspapers.
3) He buys the newspapers for 75% less than the price at which he sells them. This means he buys each newspaper for $0.50 (25% of $2).
4) The total cost of the 500 newspapers is 500 * $0.50 = $250.
5) The total revenue from selling 400 newspapers at $2 each is 400 * $2 = $800.
6) The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $800 - $250 = $550.

Answer: $550
