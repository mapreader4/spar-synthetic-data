Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Tabitha starts with $25.
2) She gives her mom $8, so now she has $25 - $8 = $17 left.
3) She invests half of the remaining $17, which is $17 / 2 = $8.50.
4) Now she has $17 - $8.50 = $8.50 left.
5) She spends $0.50 on 5 items, which is $0.50 x 5 = $2.50.
6) So, she has $8.50 - $2.50 = $6.00 left.

Answer: $6
