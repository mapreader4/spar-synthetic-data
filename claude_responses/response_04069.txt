Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sam made 40 sausage links from 10 pounds of spicy meat mix
* 1 pound = 16 ounces
* So, 10 pounds of meat mix = 160 ounces (10 pounds x 16 ounces/pound)
* The 40 sausage links were made from 160 ounces of meat mix
* Brandy ate 12 of the 40 sausage links
* So, the remaining number of sausage links is 40 - 12 = 28 links
* Each sausage link contains an equal amount of the 160 ounces of meat mix
* Therefore, the amount of sausage meat in the remaining 28 links is:
* (160 ounces / 40 links) x 28 links = 112 ounces

Answer: 112 ounces
