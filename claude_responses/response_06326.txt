Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Ali has $480 to start with.
2) He spent half of it on food. Half of $480 is $240, so he spent $240 on food.
3) Now he has $480 - $240 = $240 left.
4) He then spent a third of the remaining $240 on a pair of glasses. One-third of $240 is $80, so he spent $80 on the glasses.
5) The amount of money he has left is the original $480, minus the $240 he spent on food, minus the $80 he spent on the glasses.
6) $480 - $240 - $80 = $160.

Answer: $160
