Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Lara was 9 years old 7 years ago
* To find her current age, we add 7 years to 9 years
* 9 years + 7 years = 16 years
* So Lara is currently 16 years old
* Now, we need to find how old she will be 10 years from now
* We add 10 years to her current age of 16 years
* 16 years + 10 years = 26 years

Answer: 26
