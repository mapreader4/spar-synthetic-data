Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
1) We know that Anais has 30 more toys than Kamari.
2) We also know that there are 160 toys altogether.
3) Let's represent the number of toys in Kamari's box as x.
4) Then, the number of toys in Anais' box would be x + 30.
5) The total number of toys is 160, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 30) = 160
6) Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 30 = 160
7) Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:
2x = 130
8) Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 65
Answer: 65
