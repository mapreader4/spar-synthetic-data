Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses
* To find how much coffee was in each thermos, we divide the total amount of coffee (4.5 gallons) by the number of thermoses (18):
* 4.5 gallons / 18 thermoses = 0.25 gallons per thermos
* Genevieve drank 3 thermoses
* To find how many pints of coffee Genevieve drank, we need to convert the 0.25 gallons per thermos to pints:
* 1 gallon = 8 pints
* 0.25 gallons per thermos x 8 pints/gallon = 2 pints per thermos
* Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, so the total amount of coffee she drank is:
* 3 thermoses x 2 pints/thermos = 6 pints

Answer: 6 pints
