Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Chloe bought chocolate-dipped strawberries at $50 a dozen.
2) She then sold them for $30 for half a dozen.
3) She sold 50 dozens in total.
4) To calculate her profit, we need to find the difference between her total revenue and her total cost.
5) Total revenue: She sold 50 dozens, which is 100 half-dozens. At $30 per half-dozen, her total revenue is 100 * $30 = $3,000.
6) Total cost: She bought 50 dozens at $50 per dozen, so her total cost is 50 * $50 = $2,500.
7) Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $3,000 - $2,500 = $500.

Answer: $500.
