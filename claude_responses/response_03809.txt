Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Norma leaves 9 T-shirts in the washer
* She also leaves twice as many sweaters as T-shirts, which means she leaves 18 sweaters in the washer
* So the total number of items she leaves in the washer is 9 T-shirts + 18 sweaters = 27 items
* When she returns, she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts, which means she finds 27 T-shirts
* So the total number of items she finds is 3 sweaters + 27 T-shirts = 30 items
* The number of items missing is the difference between the total items she left and the total items she found, which is 27 - 30 = -3 items

Answer: -3
