Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There were 2450 sheets of paper in total.
2) These 2450 sheets were evenly split into 5 binders.
3) To find the number of sheets in each binder, we divide the total number of sheets (2450) by the number of binders (5):
   2450 รท 5 = 490 sheets per binder
4) Justine took one binder and colored on one-half of the sheets of paper in that binder.
5) One-half of 490 sheets is 245 sheets.

Answer: 245
