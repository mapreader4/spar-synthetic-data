Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The cafe has 9 indoor tables
* Each indoor table has 10 chairs
* So, the total number of chairs for the indoor tables is:
  * 9 indoor tables x 10 chairs per table = 90 chairs
* The cafe has 11 outdoor tables
* Each outdoor table has 3 chairs
* So, the total number of chairs for the outdoor tables is:
  * 11 outdoor tables x 3 chairs per table = 33 chairs
* To find the total number of chairs, we add the indoor chairs and outdoor chairs:
  * 90 indoor chairs + 33 outdoor chairs = 123 chairs

Answer: 123
