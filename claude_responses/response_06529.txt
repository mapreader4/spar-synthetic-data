Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The living room measures 16' long and 20' wide.
2) The total area of the living room is 16' x 20' = 320 sq ft.
3) The flooring comes in boxes of 10 sq ft per box.
4) Tom has already put down 250 sq ft of flooring.
5) To calculate the remaining area that needs to be covered, we take the total area of the living room (320 sq ft) and subtract the area that has already been covered (250 sq ft):
320 sq ft - 250 sq ft = 70 sq ft.
6) To calculate the number of boxes needed, we divide the remaining area (70 sq ft) by the area per box (10 sq ft):
70 sq ft / 10 sq ft per box = 7 boxes.

Answer: 7 boxes.
