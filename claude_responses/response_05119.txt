Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:
* We are given that there are 30 4-wheel drive cars in the parking lot
* Each 4-wheel drive car has 4 main tires and 1 spare tire
* To find the total number of tires in the parking lot, we need to multiply the number of cars by the total number of tires per car
* Each car has 4 main tires and 1 spare tire, so the total number of tires per car is 5
* Therefore, the total number of tires in the parking lot is:
* 30 cars x 5 tires per car = 150 tires

Answer: 150
