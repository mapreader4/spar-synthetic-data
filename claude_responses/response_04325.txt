Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jill spends 12 minutes waiting for her first bus.
2) She then spends 30 minutes riding on her first bus.
3) The combined wait and trip time for the first bus is 12 + 30 = 42 minutes.
4) Jill spends half the combined wait and trip time on her second bus.
5) Half of 42 minutes is 21 minutes.

Answer: 21 minutes
