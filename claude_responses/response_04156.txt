Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Wendy's truck has a gas tank that can hold 20 gallons, and it is currently half full.
2) To calculate the amount of gas in the truck's tank, we take the total capacity (20 gallons) and multiply it by the fraction of the tank that is full (1/2).
3) 20 gallons * 1/2 = 10 gallons of gas in the truck's tank.
4) Wendy's car has a gas tank that can hold 12 gallons, and it is currently 1/3 full.
5) To calculate the amount of gas in the car's tank, we take the total capacity (12 gallons) and multiply it by the fraction of the tank that is full (1/3).
6) 12 gallons * 1/3 = 4 gallons of gas in the car's tank.
7) To fill both the truck and the car completely, we need to add the difference between the full capacity and the current amount of gas in each tank.
8) For the truck, the difference is 20 gallons - 10 gallons = 10 gallons.
9) For the car, the difference is 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons.
10) The total amount of gas that Wendy needs to add is 10 gallons + 8 gallons = 18 gallons.

Answer: 18 gallons.
