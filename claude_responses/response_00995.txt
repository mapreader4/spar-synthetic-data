Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* Josh and Anna were both born on August 17th, but in different years
* They got married on August 17th when Josh turned 22
* Today, they are celebrating 30 years of marriage
* Their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married

First, let's find out how old Josh is now:
* Josh was 22 when they got married
* They have been married for 30 years
* So, Josh's current age is 22 + 30 = 52

Now, let's find out their combined age:
* Their combined age is 5 times what Josh's age was when they married
* Josh's age when they married was 22
* So, their combined age is 5 x 22 = 110

Now, we can find Anna's age:
* Their combined age is 110
* Josh's age is 52
* So, Anna's age is 110 - 52 = 58

Therefore, Anna was 58 - 30 = 28 years old when they got married.

Answer: 28
