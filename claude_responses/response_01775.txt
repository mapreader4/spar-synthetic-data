Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first student counted 12 squirrels
* The second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student
* To calculate the number of squirrels the second student counted, we take the first student's count (12) and add a third of that amount:
    - 12 + (12 / 3) = 12 + 4 = 16 squirrels
* Now, to find the total number of squirrels both students counted, we add the counts of the two students:
    - 12 + 16 = 28 squirrels

Answer: 28
