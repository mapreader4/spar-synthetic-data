Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eduardo taught 3 classes last week
* Frankie taught double the number of classes that Eduardo taught
* To find the total number of classes taught by Eduardo and Frankie, we need to add Eduardo's classes and Frankie's classes

First, let's find out how many classes Frankie taught:
* Frankie taught double the number of classes that Eduardo taught
* So, Frankie taught 2 x 3 = 6 classes

Now, we can find the total number of classes taught by Eduardo and Frankie:
* Eduardo taught 3 classes
* Frankie taught 6 classes
* The total number of classes taught is 3 + 6 = 9 classes

Answer: 9
