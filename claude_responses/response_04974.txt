Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John takes 3 days off of streaming per week
* That means he streams for 4 days per week
* On the days he does stream, he streams for 4 hours at a time
* He makes $10 an hour while streaming
* To calculate his weekly earnings, we need to:
  1. Calculate the total number of hours he streams per week
  2. Multiply the total hours by his hourly rate

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours he streams per week
* He streams for 4 days per week
* He streams for 4 hours at a time
* So, the total number of hours he streams per week is 4 days x 4 hours = 16 hours

Step 2: Multiply the total hours by his hourly rate
* He makes $10 an hour
* 16 hours x $10 per hour = $160

Answer: $160
