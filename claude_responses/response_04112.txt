Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The average pig produces 20 pounds of bacon
* The farmer sells each pound of bacon for $6
* This month's pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig

To calculate the farmer's earnings from this month's pig, we need to:
1. Calculate the amount of bacon produced by the runt pig
2. Multiply the amount of bacon by the selling price per pound

Step 1: Amount of bacon produced by the runt pig
* The runt pig is half the size of the average pig
* Therefore, the runt pig produces 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon

Step 2: Earnings from selling the bacon
* The farmer sells each pound of bacon for $6
* The runt pig produced 10 pounds of bacon
* Therefore, the farmer's earnings = 10 pounds x $6 per pound = $60

Answer: $60
