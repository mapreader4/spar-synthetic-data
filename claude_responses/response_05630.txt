Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sara worked for 2 weeks
* She worked 40 hours per week
* Her hourly rate was $11.50
* So, her total earnings for the 2 weeks would be:
  * 2 weeks x 40 hours/week x $11.50/hour = $920
* She then spent $410 on a new set of tires for her car
* To calculate the amount of money she was left with, we take her total earnings and subtract the cost of the tires:
  * $920 - $410 = $510

Answer: $510
