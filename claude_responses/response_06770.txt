Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* 5 years ago, there were 500 old books in the library
* 2 years ago, the librarian bought 300 new books
* 1 year ago, the librarian bought 100 more books than the previous year, which was 300 + 100 = 400 books
* This year, the librarian donated 200 of the library's old books

To calculate the total number of books in the library now, we need to:
1. Add the number of books bought in the last 2 years:
   * 2 years ago: 300 books
   * 1 year ago: 400 books
   * Total books bought: 300 + 400 = 700 books
2. Add the original 500 old books to the 700 new books:
   * 500 + 700 = 1200 books
3. Subtract the 200 books that were donated this year:
   * 1200 - 200 = 1000 books

Answer: 1000
