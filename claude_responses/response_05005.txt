Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Melissa drives to town twice each month
* It takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back
* We need to find how many hours she spends driving in a year

First, let's calculate how many hours she spends driving in a month:
* 2 trips per month x 3 hours per trip = 6 hours per month

Now, to find the total hours in a year, we multiply the monthly hours by 12 months:
* 6 hours per month x 12 months = 72 hours per year

Answer: 72
