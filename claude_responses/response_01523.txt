Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cost of a replacement stove is $1200.
2) The cost of fixing the damage to the wall behind the stove is 1/6th as much as the replacement stove.
3) To calculate the cost of fixing the wall, we take the cost of the replacement stove ($1200) and divide it by 6.
4) $1200 / 6 = $200
5) The total cost is the cost of the replacement stove ($1200) plus the cost of fixing the wall ($200).
6) $1200 + $200 = $1400

Answer: $1400
