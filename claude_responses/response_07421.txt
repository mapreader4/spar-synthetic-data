Okay, let's break this down step by step:
* The total prize money is $2,400
* The first winner will receive a third of the money
* The remaining amount will be divided among the next ten winners, with each receiving a 10th of the remaining amount

First, let's calculate the amount the first winner will receive:
* One-third of $2,400 is $800

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount to be divided among the next ten winners:
* Remaining amount = $2,400 - $800 = $1,600

Each of the next ten winners will receive a 10th of the remaining amount:
* $1,600 / 10 = $160

Therefore, each of the next ten winners will receive $160.

Answer: $160
