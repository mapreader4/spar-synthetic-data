Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 3 ducks in the pond
* One duck eats half of all the pieces of bread
* Another duck eats 13 pieces of bread
* The last duck eats 7 pieces of bread
* There are 30 pieces of bread left in the water

To find the total number of pieces of bread thrown in the pond, we need to work backwards from the 30 pieces of bread left.

The last duck ate 7 pieces, so the total number of pieces must be at least 7 more than 30, which is 37.

The second duck ate 13 pieces, so the total number of pieces must be at least 13 more than 37, which is 50.

The first duck ate half of all the pieces, so the total number of pieces must be at least twice 50, which is 100.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of bread thrown in the pond is 100.

Answer: 100
