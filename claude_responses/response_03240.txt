Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Leila spent $40 on a sweater, which is 1/4 of her total money.
2) If $40 is 1/4 of her total money, then her total money before buying the sweater was $40 x 4 = $160.
3) After buying the sweater, Leila was left with $20.
4) The amount Leila spent on the rest of her money (i.e., jewelry) is $160 - $20 = $140.
5) The difference between the amount spent on jewelry ($140) and the amount spent on the sweater ($40) is $140 - $40 = $100.

Answer: 100
