Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John was originally 66 inches tall.
* He had a growth spurt and grew 2 inches per month for 3 months.
* To calculate his new height, we need to add the growth from the 3 months to his original height:
* 2 inches per month x 3 months = 6 inches
* 66 inches + 6 inches = 72 inches
* To convert his height to feet, we divide 72 inches by 12 inches per foot:
* 72 inches / 12 inches per foot = 6 feet

Answer: 6 feet
