Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Arvin wants to run a total of 20 kilometers in a week
* On the first day, he ran 2 kilometers
* On each subsequent day, he increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day
* He runs for 5 days a week

To find the distance he ran on the 5th day, we need to calculate the distance he ran each day:
* Day 1: 2 kilometers
* Day 2: 2 + 1 = 3 kilometers
* Day 3: 3 + 1 = 4 kilometers
* Day 4: 4 + 1 = 5 kilometers
* Day 5: 5 + 1 = 6 kilometers

Therefore, on the 5th day, Arvin ran 6 kilometers.
