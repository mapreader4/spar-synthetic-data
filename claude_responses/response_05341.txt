Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mark is 5 feet 3 inches tall
* 1 foot is equal to 12 inches
* So, Mark's height in inches is:
    - 5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 60 inches
    - 3 inches
    - Total: 60 inches + 3 inches = 63 inches
* Mike is 6 feet 1 inch tall
* Mike's height in inches is:
    - 6 feet x 12 inches/foot = 72 inches
    - 1 inch
    - Total: 72 inches + 1 inch = 73 inches
* To find how much taller Mike is than Mark:
    - Mike's height: 73 inches
    - Mark's height: 63 inches
    - Difference: 73 inches - 63 inches = 10 inches

Answer: 10 inches
