Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Vins rides 6 miles to school
* Vins rides 7 miles back home
* This week, Vins rode to school and back 5 times

To calculate the total miles Vins rode his bike this week, we need to:
1. Calculate the total distance for one round trip (to school and back home)
   * Distance to school: 6 miles
   * Distance back home: 7 miles
   * Total distance for one round trip = 6 miles + 7 miles = 13 miles
2. Calculate the total distance for 5 round trips
   * Total distance = 13 miles x 5 = 65 miles

Therefore, the total miles Vins rode his bike this week is:

Answer: 65 miles
