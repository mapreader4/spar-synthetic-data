Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Brianna started with 24 marbles in the bag.
2) She lost 4 marbles through a hole in the bag.
3) She then gave away twice as many marbles as she had lost through the hole, which is 2 x 4 = 8 marbles.
4) Finally, her dog ate half as many marbles as she had lost through the hole, which is 4 / 2 = 2 marbles.

So, the total number of marbles lost is:
4 (lost through the hole) + 8 (given away) + 2 (eaten by the dog) = 14 marbles

Therefore, the number of marbles Brianna had remaining is:
24 (initial amount) - 14 (total lost) = 10 marbles

Answer: 10
