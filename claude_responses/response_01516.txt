Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Lucille has to divide the revenue from her business in the ratio of 4:11 for employee salaries and stock purchases, respectively.
2) The total ratio is 4 + 11 = 15.
3) Lucille has $3000 as her revenue.
4) To find the amount spent on employee salaries, we need to find the portion of the total revenue that corresponds to the 4 part of the ratio.
5) The 4 part of the ratio is 4/15 of the total revenue.
6) 4/15 of $3000 is (4/15) * $3000 = $800.

Answer: $800
