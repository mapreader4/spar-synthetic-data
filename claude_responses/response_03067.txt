Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Aiguo had 20 seashells.
2. Vail had 5 less than Aiguo, so Vail had 20 - 5 = 15 seashells.
3. Stefan had 16 more seashells than Vail, so Stefan had 15 + 16 = 31 seashells.

Now, to find the total number of seashells the 3 children had, we add up their individual amounts:
Aiguo: 20 seashells
Vail: 15 seashells
Stefan: 31 seashells

Total seashells = 20 + 15 + 31 = 66 seashells

Answer: 66
