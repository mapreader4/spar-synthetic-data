Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Frankie has 6 more snakes than he has cats. So if he has x cats, he has x + 6 snakes.
2) Frankie has one less parrot than cats. So if he has x cats, he has x - 1 parrots.
3) Six of his pets have four legs. We know he has 2 dogs, so the other 4 four-legged pets must be the cats and snakes. Since he has x cats and x + 6 snakes, that means he has 2x + 6 four-legged pets.
4) In total, Frankie has:
- 2 dogs
- x cats
- x + 6 snakes
- x - 1 parrots
So the total number of pets is 2 + x + (x + 6) + (x - 1) = 4x + 7.

Answer: 4x + 7
