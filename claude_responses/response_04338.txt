Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* One third of the fish in the tank are blue
* Half of the blue fish have spots
* There are 10 blue, spotted fish

First, let's find the number of blue fish in the tank. We know that half of the blue fish have spots, and there are 10 blue, spotted fish. So, the total number of blue fish must be twice the number of blue, spotted fish.
* Total number of blue fish = 2 x 10 = 20

Now, we know that one third of the fish in the tank are blue. So, to find the total number of fish in the tank, we can divide the number of blue fish by one third.
* Total number of fish in the tank = 20 / (1/3) = 60

Answer: 60
