Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Annie spends 2 hours a week on chess club
* Annie spends 8 hours a week on drama club
* Annie spends 3 hours a week on glee club
* There are 12 weeks in each semester
* Annie takes the first two weeks off sick

First, let's calculate the total number of hours per week for all her extracurricular activities:
* 2 hours (chess club) + 8 hours (drama club) + 3 hours (glee club) = 13 hours per week

Now, let's calculate the number of weeks she is active in extracurriculars:
* There are 12 weeks in the semester
* Annie takes the first two weeks off sick
* So, she is active for 12 - 2 = 10 weeks

Finally, we can calculate the total number of hours of extracurriculars before midterms:
* 13 hours per week x 10 weeks = 130 hours

Answer: 130
