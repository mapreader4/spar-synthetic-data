Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Initially, the jar contains:
- 9 blue pens
- 21 black pens
- 6 red pens
2) 4 blue pens are removed, so now there are 9 - 4 = 5 blue pens left.
3) 7 black pens are removed, so now there are 21 - 7 = 14 black pens left.
4) The number of red pens remains the same at 6.
5) Therefore, the total number of pens left in the jar is:
5 blue pens + 14 black pens + 6 red pens = 25 pens.

Answer: 25
