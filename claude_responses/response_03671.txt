Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Diana needs to bike 10 miles to get home.
2) She can bike 3 mph for two hours before she gets tired.
3) In the first two hours, she can bike 3 mph for 2 hours, which is 6 miles.
4) That means she has 4 miles left to bike (10 miles - 6 miles = 4 miles).
5) She can bike 1 mph until she gets home.
6) It will take her 4 hours to bike the remaining 4 miles at 1 mph (4 miles / 1 mph = 4 hours).
7) In total, it will take Diana 2 hours + 4 hours = 6 hours to get home.
