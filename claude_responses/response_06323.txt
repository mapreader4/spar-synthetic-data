Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, there were 90 jellybeans in the jar.
2) Samantha took 24 jellybeans out of the jar without being seen.
3) Shelby then ate 12 jellybeans from the jar.
4) So the total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36 jellybeans.
5) Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 36 / 2 = 18 jellybeans.
6) Therefore, the total number of jellybeans in the jar now is the initial 90 jellybeans, minus the 36 jellybeans taken out, plus the 18 jellybeans refilled by Shannon.
7) 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans.

Answer: 72 jellybeans.
