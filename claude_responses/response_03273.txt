Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farmer plants 4 seeds for every 1 ear of corn he gets
* He can sell each ear of corn for $0.1
* It costs $0.5 for a bag of 100 seeds
* The farmer makes a profit of $40

To find the number of ears of corn he sold, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the seeds he planted
2. Calculate the total revenue he made from selling the ears of corn
3. Subtract the cost of the seeds from the total revenue to get the profit
4. Divide the profit by the profit per ear of corn to get the number of ears sold

Step 1: Cost of the seeds
* 1 bag of 100 seeds costs $0.5
* So 1 seed costs $0.5 / 100 = $0.005
* The farmer planted 4 seeds per ear of corn
* So the cost per ear of corn is 4 * $0.005 = $0.02

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the ears of corn
* The farmer sold each ear of corn for $0.1
* So the total revenue is the number of ears sold multiplied by $0.1

Step 3: Profit
* The total profit is $40
* The cost per ear of corn is $0.02
* So the profit per ear of corn is $0.1 - $0.02 = $0.08

Step 4: Number of ears sold
* Profit = $40
* Profit per ear = $0.08
* Number of ears sold = $40 / $0.08 = 500

Answer: 500
