Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Steve initially puts $100 into the bank.
2) After the first year, he earns 10% interest on the $100. 10% of $100 is $10, so the new balance is $100 + $10 = $110.
3) After the second year, he earns 10% interest on the $110. 10% of $110 is $11, so the new balance is $110 + $11 = $121.

Answer: $121
