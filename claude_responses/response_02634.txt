Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The price of a math textbook in the school bookshop is $45.
2) The textbooks sold in bookshops outside the school cost 20% less.
3) To calculate the price of the textbooks outside the school, we take the original price ($45) and subtract 20% of that price:
   $45 - (0.20 x $45) = $45 - $9 = $36
4) Peter wants to buy 3 math textbooks.
5) If he buys them from the school bookshop, the total cost would be:
   3 x $45 = $135
6) If he buys them from other bookshops, the total cost would be:
   3 x $36 = $108
7) The amount Peter can save by buying from other bookshops is the difference between the two total costs:
   $135 - $108 = $27

Answer: $27
