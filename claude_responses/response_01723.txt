Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Emani has $30 more money than Howard.
2) Emani has $150.
3) Since Emani has $30 more than Howard, we can calculate Howard's money by subtracting $30 from Emani's $150.
4) Howard's money = $150 - $30 = $120.
5) Now, they decide to combine and share the money equally.
6) The total amount of money is Emani's $150 + Howard's $120 = $270.
7) To share the money equally, we divide the total amount by 2.
8) $270 / 2 = $135.

Answer: $135.
