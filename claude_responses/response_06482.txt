Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The lake is full of turtles, and 60% of the turtles are female.
2) The remaining 40% of the turtles are male.
3) Of the male turtles, 1 in 4 has stripes.
4) Of the turtles with stripes, 4 are babies, and 60% are adults.

Now, let's solve for the total number of turtles in the lake:
* If 60% of the turtles are female, then 40% are male.
* Of the male turtles, 1 in 4 has stripes.
* Of the turtles with stripes, 4 are babies and 60% are adults.

To find the total number of turtles, we need to find the number of male turtles with stripes, and then add that to the number of female turtles.

Let's start with the male turtles with stripes:
* If 40% of the turtles are male, and 1 in 4 of those have stripes, then the number of male turtles with stripes is 10% of the total.
* Of those 10% with stripes, 4 are babies and 60% are adults.
* So the number of male turtles with stripes is 10% of the total, with 4 being babies and 60% being adults.

Now, let's add the female turtles:
* Since 60% of the turtles are female, the number of female turtles is 60% of the total.

Therefore, the total number of turtles in the lake is the sum of the female turtles and the male turtles with stripes.

Answer: The total number of turtles in the lake is 100.
