Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Laura charges $5 for a car, $6 for a truck, and $7 for an SUV
* They raised a total of $100
* They washed 5 SUVs and 5 trucks

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the 5 SUVs and 5 trucks:
* 5 SUVs at $7 each = $35
* 5 trucks at $6 each = $30
* Total from SUVs and trucks = $35 + $30 = $65

Now, we can calculate the remaining amount that must have come from the cars:
* Total raised = $100
* Total from SUVs and trucks = $65
* Remaining amount from cars = $100 - $65 = $35

Finally, we can calculate the number of cars washed:
* Cars were charged $5 each
* Remaining amount from cars was $35
* Number of cars washed = $35 / $5 = 7
