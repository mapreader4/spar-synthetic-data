Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initial cost to open the amusement park: $100,000
* Daily running cost: 1% of $100,000 = $1,000 per day
* Ticket sales per day: 150 tickets x $10 per ticket = $1,500 per day
* Profit per day: $1,500 (ticket sales) - $1,000 (running cost) = $500 per day

To calculate how long it will take to make back the initial $100,000 investment, we divide the initial cost by the daily profit:
* $100,000 / $500 per day = 200 days

Therefore, it will take 200 days to make back the initial $100,000 investment.

Answer: 200
