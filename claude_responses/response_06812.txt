Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alice made 52 friendship bracelets over spring break.
2) It cost her $3.00 in materials to make these bracelets.
3) During the break, she gave 8 of her bracelets away.
4) This means she had 52 - 8 = 44 bracelets left to sell.
5) She sold each bracelet for $0.25.
6) So the total revenue from selling the 44 bracelets is 44 * $0.25 = $11.00.
7) The initial cost to make the bracelets was $3.00.
8) Therefore, the profit she made is the total revenue ($11.00) minus the initial cost ($3.00), which is $11.00 - $3.00 = $8.00.

Answer: $8
