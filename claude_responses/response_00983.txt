Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Carter is twice as tall as his 24" tall dog.
   * This means Carter's height is 2 x 24" = 48"
2) Betty is 12" shorter than Carter.
   * This means Betty's height is 48" - 12" = 36"
3) To convert Betty's height to feet, we divide 36" by 12 inches per foot.
   * 36" / 12 inches per foot = 3 feet

Answer: 3 feet
