Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The train travels 270 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is 270 miles / 3 hours = 90 miles per hour.
2) We want to find how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 180 miles at the same rate of 90 miles per hour.
3) To find the additional time, we can divide the additional distance (180 miles) by the speed (90 miles per hour).
4) 180 miles / 90 miles per hour = 2 hours.
