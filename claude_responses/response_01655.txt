Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Abe's monthly budget is $3000
* He spends a third of his budget on food
* To calculate the amount spent on food:
  - 1/3 of $3000 = $1000
* He spends a quarter of his budget on restaurant supplies
* To calculate the amount spent on restaurant supplies:
  - 1/4 of $3000 = $750
* The remaining amount is spent on employee wages
* To calculate the amount spent on wages:
  - Total budget = $3000
  - Amount spent on food = $1000
  - Amount spent on restaurant supplies = $750
  - Amount spent on wages = $3000 - $1000 - $750 = $1250

Answer: $1250
