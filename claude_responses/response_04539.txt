Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 13 hotel rooms at Palm Meadows
* 8 of the rooms have 2 beds each
* The remaining 5 rooms (13 - 8 = 5) have 3 beds each

To calculate the total number of beds, we need to add up the beds in the 8 rooms with 2 beds each, and the beds in the 5 rooms with 3 beds each.

For the 8 rooms with 2 beds each:
* 8 rooms x 2 beds per room = 16 beds

For the 5 rooms with 3 beds each:
* 5 rooms x 3 beds per room = 15 beds

Now we add the two totals together:
* 16 beds + 15 beds = 31 beds

Answer: 31
