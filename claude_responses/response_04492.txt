Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jane bought 2 skirts for $13 each, so the total cost of the skirts is:
2 x $13 = $26
2) Jane bought 3 blouses for $6 each, so the total cost of the blouses is:
3 x $6 = $18
3) The total cost of the items Jane bought is the sum of the cost of the skirts and the cost of the blouses:
$26 + $18 = $44
4) Jane paid the cashier $100.
5) To calculate the change Jane received, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount she paid:
$100 - $44 = $56

Answer: $56
