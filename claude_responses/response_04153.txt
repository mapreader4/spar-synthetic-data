Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) When Hannah was 6 years old, her age was double the age of her sister July.
   * This means that when Hannah was 6, July was 3 years old (6 / 2 = 3).
2) Now, 20 years later, July's husband is 2 years older than her.
   * This means that July is now 23 years old (3 + 20 = 23).
   * And her husband is 25 years old (23 + 2 = 25).

Answer: 25
