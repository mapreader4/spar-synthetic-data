Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Trey used a nail for two-thirds of the wall decorations.
2) He used a thumbtack for two-fifths of the remaining one-third of the decorations.
3) He used a sticky strip for the other decorations.
4) We know that he used 15 sticky strips.
5) Let's call the total number of wall decorations 'x'.
6) Two-thirds of 'x' were hung with nails, so the number of nails used is (2/3)x.
7) The remaining one-third of 'x' is (1/3)x.
8) Two-fifths of (1/3)x were hung with thumbtacks, so the number of thumbtacks used is (2/5)(1/3)x = (2/15)x.
9) The remaining decorations were hung with sticky strips, which we know is 15.
10) So the number of decorations hung with sticky strips is 15.
11) The total number of decorations is the sum of the nails, thumbtacks, and sticky strips: (2/3)x + (2/15)x + 15 = x.
12) Solving for x, we get x = 45.
13) Therefore, the number of nails used is (2/3)x = (2/3)45 = 30.

Answer: 30
