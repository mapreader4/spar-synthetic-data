Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Julie's hourly rate is $5
* She works 8 hours a day
* She works 6 days a week
* She was not able to go to work for a day

To calculate her weekly salary:
* She works 8 hours per day
* She works 6 days a week
* So her weekly hours are 8 hours x 6 days = 48 hours
* Her hourly rate is $5
* So her weekly salary is 48 hours x $5 per hour = $240

Now, to calculate her monthly salary:
* Assuming a month has 4 weeks
* Her monthly salary is $240 per week x 4 weeks = $960

However, she was not able to go to work for a day, so we need to adjust her monthly salary:
* She works 8 hours per day
* She missed 1 day of work
* So her lost earnings for that day are 8 hours x $5 per hour = $40
* Her adjusted monthly salary is $960 - $40 = $920

Answer: $920
