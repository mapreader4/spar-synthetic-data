Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Dalton watched 7 movies
* Hunter watched 12 movies
* Alex watched 15 movies
* They all watched 2 movies together
* Every other movie they watched was different

First, let's calculate the total number of movies they watched:
* Dalton: 7 movies
* Hunter: 12 movies
* Alex: 15 movies
* Together: 2 movies
* Total: 7 + 12 + 15 - 2 = 32 movies

Now, let's calculate the number of different movies they saw:
* Dalton watched 7 different movies
* Hunter watched 10 different movies (12 - 2)
* Alex watched 13 different movies (15 - 2)
* Together they watched 2 movies
* Total different movies: 7 + 10 + 13 - 2 = 28 movies

Answer: 28
