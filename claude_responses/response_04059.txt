Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mike trains every day for a tournament.
2. On the first day, he trains for a maximum of 2 hours.
3. After a week of training (7 days), he increases the maximum time to 3 hours.
4. To calculate the total hours trained in the first two weeks:
   - First week: 7 days x 2 hours = 14 hours
   - Second week: 7 days x 3 hours = 21 hours
5. Total hours trained in the first two weeks = 14 hours + 21 hours = 35 hours

Answer: 35
