Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Anthony originally had 16 pets.
2) He lost 6 pets when he forgot to lock the door.
3) After that, 1/5 of his remaining pets died from old age.
4) To calculate how many pets died from old age, we take 1/5 of the remaining pets after the 6 were lost:
   * Remaining pets after losing 6: 16 - 6 = 10
   * 1/5 of 10 = 2 pets died from old age
5) So the total number of pets Anthony has left is:
   * Original 16 pets
   * Minus 6 pets lost
   * Minus 2 pets that died from old age
   * 16 - 6 - 2 = 8 pets
