Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Francine drives 140km to work each day
* She does not go to work 3 days every week
* We need to find the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks

First, let's calculate the number of days she goes to work in a week:
* There are 7 days in a week
* She does not go to work 3 days
* So, she goes to work 7 - 3 = 4 days per week

Now, let's calculate the total distance she drives to work in a week:
* She drives 140km to work each day
* She goes to work 4 days per week
* So, the total distance she drives to work in a week is 140km x 4 = 560km

Finally, let's calculate the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks:
* She drives 560km to work each week
* There are 4 weeks
* So, the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks is 560km x 4 = 2,240km

Answer: 2,240
