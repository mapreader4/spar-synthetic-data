Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* We are given that 4 kids can wash 3 whiteboards in 20 minutes
* We want to find how long it would take 1 kid to wash 6 whiteboards
* First, we need to find the rate at which the 4 kids can wash the 3 whiteboards
* The rate is 3 whiteboards / 20 minutes = 0.15 whiteboards per minute
* Now, we need to find the rate at which 1 kid can wash whiteboards
* Since the 4 kids can wash 0.15 whiteboards per minute, 1 kid can wash 0.15 / 4 = 0.0375 whiteboards per minute
* To find how long it would take 1 kid to wash 6 whiteboards, we divide 6 whiteboards by the rate of 0.0375 whiteboards per minute
* 6 whiteboards / 0.0375 whiteboards per minute = 160 minutes

Answer: 160 minutes
