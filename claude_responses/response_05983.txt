Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Molly and her parents were already at the beach.
2) 100 people joined them during the day.
3) At 5:00, 40 people left the beach.
4) To find the total number of people at the beach, we need to add the initial group (Molly and her parents) to the 100 people who joined, and then subtract the 40 people who left.

Let's assume the initial group (Molly and her parents) is 3 people.
So, the total number of people at the beach = 3 + 100 - 40 = 63

Answer: 63
