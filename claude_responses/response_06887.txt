Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Amber initially bought 7 guppies for her pond.
2) Several days later, she sees 3 dozen baby guppies swimming around.
3 dozen = 3 x 12 = 36 baby guppies
3) Two days after that, she sees 9 more baby guppies.
4) To calculate the total number of guppies, we add the initial 7 guppies, the 36 baby guppies, and the 9 additional baby guppies:
7 + 36 + 9 = 52 guppies

Answer: 52
