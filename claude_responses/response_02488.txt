Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In 2009, Timothy went to the movies 24 times.
2. In 2010, Timothy went to the movies 7 more times than he did in 2009. So, in 2010, Timothy went to the movies 24 + 7 = 31 times.
3. In 2009, Theresa went to the movies half as many times as Timothy, which is 24 / 2 = 12 times.
4. In 2010, Theresa went to the movies twice as many times as Timothy, which is 31 x 2 = 62 times.

Now, we can add up the total number of movies Timothy and Theresa went to in both 2009 and 2010:
Timothy: 24 + 31 = 55 movies
Theresa: 12 + 62 = 74 movies

Total movies: 55 + 74 = 129 movies

Answer: 129
