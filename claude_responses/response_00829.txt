Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Jeanne wants to ride the Ferris wheel, the roller coaster, and the bumper cars
* The Ferris wheel costs 5 tickets
* The roller coaster costs 4 tickets
* The bumper cars cost 4 tickets
* Jeanne has 5 tickets

To calculate how many more tickets Jeanne should buy, we need to add up the total number of tickets required for the three rides:
* Ferris wheel: 5 tickets
* Roller coaster: 4 tickets
* Bumper cars: 4 tickets
* Total tickets required: 5 + 4 + 4 = 13 tickets

Now, we compare the total tickets required (13) to the tickets Jeanne currently has (5):
* Tickets required: 13
* Tickets Jeanne has: 5
* Tickets Jeanne needs to buy: 13 - 5 = 8

Answer: 8
