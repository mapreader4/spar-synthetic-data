Let's start by identifying the number of men employed by Lauryn.

Let's say the number of men employed by Lauryn is x.

The number of men is less than the number of women, which is given as 20. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = 180

To solve for x, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 180 - 20

x = 160

So, Lauryn employs 160 men.
