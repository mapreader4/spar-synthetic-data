To solve this problem, I will convert the height of Marissa's sister from inches to feet. 4 feet 3 inches is the same as 4 * 12 inches + 3 inches. This is because there are 12 inches in a foot. So, Marissa's sister is 4 * 12 + 3 = 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall. Now, we know that Marissa's sunflower is 21 inches taller than her sister, so we can subtract 51 inches from 21 inches to find Marissa's sunflower's height in inches. 51 - 21 = 30. So, Marissa's sunflower is 30 inches tall.
