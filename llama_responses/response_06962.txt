Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Keanu gave his dog 40 fish, and each fish costs $4. We want to find the total amount of money he spent to buy all the fish. Since Keanu gave his dog half as many fish as he gave to his dog, that means he gave his dog 40/2 = 20 fish. Since each fish costs $4, the total cost of the fish given to his dog is 20 * 4 = 80. So, the total amount of money Keanu spent is 80. 

Answer: 80
