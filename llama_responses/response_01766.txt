Let's start by finding the number of necklaces made by the first machine. Since the first machine made 45 necklaces, we know that 45 necklaces were made. The second machine made 2.4 times as many necklaces as the first machine, so the second machine made 45 * 2.4 = 108 necklaces. To find the total number of necklaces made on Sunday, we add the number of necklaces made by the first machine (45) to the number of necklaces made by the second machine (108). 45 + 108 = 153. So, the total number of necklaces made on Sunday is 153.
