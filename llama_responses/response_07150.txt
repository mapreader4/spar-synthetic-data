Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cars each person owns.

Lindsey owns 4 more cars than Cathy. So, if Cathy has x cars, then Lindley has x + 4 cars.

Cathy owns 2 fewer cars than Carol. So, if Carol has x cars, then Cathy has x - 2 cars.

We are told that Carol owns twice as many cars as Cathy. So, if Carol has x cars, then Carol has 2x cars.

We are also given that Cathy owns 5 cars. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

Let's start by substituting the information we know into the equation.

Lindsey has x + 4 = Cathy's cars, so we can write x + 4 = 5.

We know that Carol has 2x cars, so we can write 2x = 5.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2.

x = 5 / 2 = 2.5

So, Cathy owns 2.5 cars.

Now, let's add up the number of cars each person owns.

Lindsey owns x + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9.

Cathy owns 2x = 2.5 + 2.5 = 5.

Carol owns 2x = 2.5 + 2.5 = 5.

Now, let's add up the number of cars they all own.

9 + 5 + 5 = 14.

Answer: 14
