Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate the number of hours Cindy spent in the classroom for each math course.

For 1 math course, Cindy needs to be in the classroom for 4 hours a week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Cindy will be in the classroom for 4 x 4 = 16 hours per month.

Next, we need to calculate Cindy's total hours worked in a month. Since there are 4 math courses, Cindy will work 16 hours x 4 = 64 hours in a month.

Now, we need to calculate Cindy's total earnings. Cindy earns $25 per hour. So, Cindy's total earnings will be 64 hours x $25 per hour = $1600.

Answer: 1600
