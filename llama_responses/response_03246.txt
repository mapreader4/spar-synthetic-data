Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the volume of one iron bar. The iron bar measures 12 cm by 8 cm by 6 cm, so its volume is:

Volume = Length x Width x Height = 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm = 96 cubic cm

Since the factory wants to melt 10 iron bars, the total volume of the 10 iron bars is:

10 x 96 cubic cm = 960 cubic cm

Since each iron ball has a volume of 8 cubic cm, we can divide the total volume by 8 to find the number of iron balls that can be molded:

960 cubic cm รท 8 cubic cm = 120

So, 120 iron balls can be molded.
