Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many hours Yella's computer usage was last week. It was 91 hours.

Next, let's find out how many hours Yella plans to use the computer this week. She plans to use it 8 hours a day for 7 days in a week. That is a total of 56 hours.

Now, to find out how much less her computer usage is this week, we need to subtract the hours she plans to use this week from the hours she used last week.

91 - 56 = 35

Answer: 35
