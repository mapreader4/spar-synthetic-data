To find the average number of branches per foot, I will first add up the total number of branches and the total height of the trees.

The total number of branches is 200 + 180 + 180 + 153 = 713.

The total height of the trees is 50 + 40 + 60 + 34 = 184.

Next, I will divide the total number of branches by the total height to find the average number of branches per foot.

713 รท 184 = 3.88

However, the problem asks for an integer answer, so I will round down to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 3
