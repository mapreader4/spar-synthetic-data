Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Jillian had 80 oranges and divided each orange into 10 equal pieces for each friend. This means that the total number of pieces of orange is 80 / 10 = 8.

Now, we need to find the number of friends. If each friend gets 8 pieces, then the number of friends is 80 / 8 = 10.

Answer: 10
