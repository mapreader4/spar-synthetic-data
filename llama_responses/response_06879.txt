Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of all the toys in the cart. Louise already has 28 toys worth $10 each, so the total cost is 28 x $10 = $280. Then, she adds 20 more teddy bears. So the total cost is now 28 + 20 = 48 toys.

Now, Louise has $580 in her wallet. Since the total cost is $280, we can subtract that from the amount she has to find out how much each teddy bear costs.

$580 - $280 = $300

So, the cost of each teddy bear is:

Answer: $300 / 20 = $15.
