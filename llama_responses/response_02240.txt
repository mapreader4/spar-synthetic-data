Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. We know that the total cost is $55 and we have 5 pints of frozen yogurt, 2 packs of chewing gum, and 5 trays of jumbo shrimp. We can write this as an equation:

5 x (price of a pint of yogurt) + 2 x (price of a pack of gum) + 5 x 5 = 55

We can start by solving for the price of a pint of yogurt. We know that the price of a pack of gum is half as much as a pint of yogurt, so we can let x be the price of a pint of yogurt. We can represent this as:

Price of a pack of gum = 0.5 x (price of a pint of yogurt)

Now, we can substitute this into our equation:

5 x (price of a pint of yogurt) + 2 x 0.5 x (price of a pint of yogurt) + 5 x 5 = 55

We can combine the 2 x 0.5 and the 5 to get 2.5, and then we can multiply this by the price of a pint of yogurt to get:

5 x (price of a pint of yogurt) + 2.5 x (price of a pint of yogurt) = 55

Now, we can subtract 2.5 x (price of a pint of yogurt) from both sides to get:

5 x (price of a pint of yogurt) = 55 - 2.5 x (price of a pint of yogurt)

Now, we can divide both sides by 5 to get:

price of a pint of yogurt = 11

So, the answer is:

Answer: 11
