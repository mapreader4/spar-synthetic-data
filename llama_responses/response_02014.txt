Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first figure out how many tanks she has built so far.

Jennifer has built 3 tanks that hold 15 fish each, so she has built a total of 3 x 15 = 45 fish. She needs to build enough tanks to hold 75 fish. To do this, she needs to build 75 - 45 = 30 more tanks.
