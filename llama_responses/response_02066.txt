Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The restaurant donates $2 for every $10 donated. This means that for every $10 donated, the restaurant donates $2.
2. The average customer donates $3, which is 3 * $1.
3. There are 40 customers in total, so the total amount of money donated by the customers is 40 * $3 = $120.
4. To find the total amount donated by the restaurant, we multiply the total amount donated by the customers by the amount the restaurant donates per customer, which is $2.

Answer: 40 * 3 * 2 = 120
