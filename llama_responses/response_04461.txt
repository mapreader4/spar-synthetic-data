Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of students Ms. Hatcher teaches in each grade level:

* 20 third-graders
* 2 x 20 = 40 fourth-graders
* 1/2 x 20 = 10 fifth-graders

To find the total number of students Ms. Hatcher teaches, we add the number of students in each grade level:

20 + 40 + 10 = 70

Answer: 70
