To find the average weight of the three people, we can first find the weight of each person:

Rachel weighs 75 pounds.
Jimmy weighs 6 pounds less than Rachel, which is 75 - 6 = 69 pounds.
Adam weighs 15 pounds more than Rachel, which is 75 + 15 = 90 pounds.

To find the average, we need to add the weights together and then divide by 3:

(75 + 69 + 90) / 3 = 234 / 3 = 78

Answer: 78
