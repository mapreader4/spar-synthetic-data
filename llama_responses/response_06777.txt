Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the distance traveled during the first half of the trip.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 kmph * 4 hours = 280 km

So, Martin traveled 280 kilometers during the first half of the trip.

Now, let's find the distance traveled during the second half of the trip.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 85 kmph * 4 hours = 340 km

So, Martin traveled 340 kilometers during the second half of the trip.

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distance traveled during the first half and the distance traveled during the second half of the trip.

Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
Distance = 280 km + 340 km
Distance = 620 km

So, Martin traveled 620 kilometers during the entire trip.

Answer: 620
