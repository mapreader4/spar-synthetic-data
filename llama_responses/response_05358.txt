Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find the cost of 400 peaches at 40 cents each.

400 * 0.40 = 160

So, the total cost of the peaches is $160.

Then, let's apply the $2 discount for every $10 purchase.

$160 / 10 = 16

Kataleya needs to subtract the discount from the total cost.

$160 - 16 = 144

Answer: 144
