Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say there were 28 students inside the bus before stopping at an intersection. Then, after stopping at an intersection, there were 58 students on the bus. This means that 58 - 28 = 30 students must have entered the bus at the intermediate stop.

To find 40% of the number of students who entered the bus, we can multiply the number of students who entered by 0.4 (which is 40% as a decimal).

So, 30 * 0.4 = 12.

Answer: 12
