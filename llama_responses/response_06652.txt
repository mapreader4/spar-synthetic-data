Let's break it down step by step:

Let's first calculate the total cost of the pencils sold:

1. Pencils with an eraser: 200 pencils * $0.8 = $160
2. Regular pencils: 40 pencils * $0.5 = $20
3. Short pencils: 35 pencils * $0.4 = $14

Adding these up, we get:
$160 + $20 + $14 = $194

So, the store made $194 in total.
