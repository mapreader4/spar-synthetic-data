Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start with the cost of the school bus: $100.

The cost of admission is $10 per student, so if we want to know how many students can go, we need to subtract the cost of the school bus from the budget.

$350 (budget) - $100 (cost of school bus) = $250

The remaining amount is $250, which is the amount left over for the admission.

Now, let's divide this amount by the cost of admission:

$250 (remaining budget) รท $10 (cost of admission) = 25

So, the class can take 25 students on the field trip.

Answer: 25
