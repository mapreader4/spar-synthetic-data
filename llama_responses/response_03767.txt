Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with Jon's score, which is 3 points.

Jack scored 5 points more than Jon, so Jack scored 3 + 5 = 8 points.

The total score for Jon and Jack together is Jon's score + Jack's score = 3 + 8 = 11.

Tom scored 4 less than the points of Jon and Jack together, so Tom scored 11 - 4 = 7 points.

To find the total score, we add Jon's score, Jack's score, and Tom's score: 3 + 8 + 7 = 18.

Answer: 18
