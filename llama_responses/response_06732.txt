Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate how much he paid each year. Since he made 30% of his income each year, that's 0.3x his income. In the first 3 years, he made 30% of 30,000. So, he paid 0.3 x 30,000 = 9,000 each year. 

In the next 4 years, he got a 20% raise. So, his income increased by 20% of 30,000. 20% of 30,000 is 0.2 x 30,000 = 6,000. So, his income became 30,000 + 6,000 = 36,000. 

Now, let's calculate how much he paid each year for the last 4 years. 36,000 * 0.3 = 10,800 each year. 

Now, let's add up the total amount he paid. 9,000 + 9,000 + 9,000 + 10,800 + 10,800 = 38,800. 

He paid a total of 38,800. The problem asks how much he owes Nancy. So, the answer is:
