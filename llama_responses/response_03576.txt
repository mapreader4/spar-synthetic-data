Let's break down the information we have:

* Billy swims his first 5 laps in 2 minutes, which is 120 seconds.
* He swims the next 3 laps in 4 minutes, which is 240 seconds.
* He swims the next lap in 1 minute, which is 60 seconds.
* Billy finishes all his laps 30 seconds before Margaret, who finishes in 10 minutes, which is 600 seconds.
* We can set up an equation to represent the time it takes Billy to finish all his laps: 120 + 240 + 60 + x = 600 - 30, where x is the time it takes Billy to swim his final lap.

Now, let's solve for x:

120 + 240 + 60 + x = 570

x = 570 - 420

x = 150

So, it takes Billy 150 seconds to swim his final lap.

Answer: 150
