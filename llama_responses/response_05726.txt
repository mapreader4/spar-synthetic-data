Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the ratio of the amount of money they have: 4:5:6. This means that Cara has 4 parts, Janet has 5 parts, and Jerry has 6 parts. Since they have a total of 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 parts, we can represent this as a fraction of the total amount of money they have, which is 15/15. We can convert this fraction to a decimal by dividing the total amount of money they have, $75, by 15 to get the value of one part: $75 / 15 = $5.

Now, if they combine their money and buy oranges at 80% of the buying price, they will lose 20% of the amount they pay. To find the loss, we can multiply the value of one part, $5, by 20/100 = 0.2. Then, we multiply this by the total amount of money they pay, $75, to get the loss: 0.2 * 75 = 15.

Answer: 15
