Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the hospital's current age is x. We know that in 5 years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital that he is hired into. So, in 5 years, Grant will be 2/3(x) years old.

We know that Grant is currently 25 years old, so we can write an equation to represent the age of the hospital now:

25 = x

We can solve for x:

x = 25 / 2/3

x = 25 / 2/3

x = 25 * 3 / 2

x = 25 * 3 / 2

x = 37.5

So, the hospital is currently 37.5 years old.
