Let's break this down step by step.

The blue weights are 2 pounds each, and the green weights are 3 pounds each. So, the total weight of the blue weights is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. The total weight of the green weights is 5 * 3 = 15 pounds. The metal bar itself weighs 2 pounds.

So, to find the total weight of Harry's custom creation, we need to add the weights and the bar's weight together. 8 + 15 + 2 = 25 pounds.

Answer: 25
