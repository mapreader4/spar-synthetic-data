Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Colby harvested 60 kilograms of mangoes.
* He sold 20 kilograms of mangoes at the market.
* He sold the remaining mangoes to his community.
* Each kilogram contains 8 mangoes.

We know that Colby harvested 60 kilograms of mangoes initially. We can represent this as 60 mangoes, since each kilogram contains 8 mangoes.

He sold 20 kilograms of mangoes at the market, which means he has 60 - 20 = 40 kilograms of mangoes remaining.

Now, he sold the remaining mangoes to his community. Since he sold the half of the remaining mangoes, that means he sold 40 / 2 = 20 kilograms of mangoes to his community.

Now, he has 40 kilograms of mangoes remaining.

To find the number of mangoes he has, we can multiply 40 kilograms by 8 mangoes per kilogram. 40 * 8 = 320.

Answer: 320
