Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using variables to represent the prices of each item:

* Let's say the price of the cheese is x.
* The price of the butter is 80% of the price of the cheese, so it is 0.8x.
* The price of the bread is 2 times cheaper than the butter, so it is 0.5x.
* The price of the tea is twice the price of the cheese, so it is 2x.

We know that the price of the tea is $10, so we can write an equation to represent the total cost of Ursula's purchases:

0.5x + 0.8x + x + 2x = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.5x and 0.8x from both sides of the equation, leaving us with:

x + x = 10 - 0.5x - 0.8x

We can then combine like terms on the right side of the equation:

x = 10 - 0.3x

We can then subtract 0.3x from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 10 - 0.3x

To solve for x, we can add 0.3x to both sides of the equation:

x = 10

So, the price of the cheese is $10.
