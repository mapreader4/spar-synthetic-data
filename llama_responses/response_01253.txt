Let's break down the information given:

* Danai puts 12 plastic skulls around the house.
* She puts 4 broomsticks, 1 for each side of the front and back doors.
* She puts 12 spiderwebs around the house.
* She puts twice as many pumpkins as spiderwebs, so 12 * 2 = 24 pumpkins.
* She also puts a cauldron on the dining room table.

So, in total, she puts up:

12 (skulls) + 4 (broomsticks) + 12 (spiderwebs) + 24 (pumpkins) + 1 (cauldron) = 53 decorations.

She has 10 decorations left to put up, but she wants to buy 20 more. So, she needs:

20 (new decorations) + 10 (left) = 30

Total decorations to put up = 53 (already put up) + 30 (new) = 83

Answer: 83
