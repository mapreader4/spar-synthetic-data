Let's start by identifying the number of strawberry seeds Lolita has. She has 54000 seeds. 

Next, we know that in each planting zone, 3123 seeds will be used. 

To find the total number of seeds used in 7 planting zones, we multiply 3123 by 7. 

3123 x 7 = 21861

So, 21861 seeds will be used in the 7 planting zones. 

Lolita has 54000 seeds. 

To find the number of seeds that will remain, we subtract the number of seeds used in the planting zones from the total number of seeds Lolita has.

54000 - 21861 = 32239

Answer: 32239
