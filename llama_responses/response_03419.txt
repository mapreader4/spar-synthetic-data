Let's start by finding the cost of the red socks. Since Luis bought 4 pairs of red socks and they cost $3 each, the total cost of the red socks will be 4 * 3 = 12 dollars.

The total amount of money spent, which is 42, is equal to the cost of the red socks plus the cost of the blue socks. So, the cost of the blue socks is 42 - 12 = 30. Since Luis bought 6 pairs of blue socks, the cost per pair is 30 / 6 = 5.
