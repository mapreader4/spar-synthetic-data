Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of portraits Bethany saw is x.

Then, she saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits, so the number of still lifes she saw is 4x.

The total number of paintings she saw is the sum of the number of portraits and the number of still lifes: x + 4x = 80.

We can combine like terms: x + 4x = 80.

This is a linear equation. We can solve it by subtracting 4x from both sides of the equation, like so:

x + 4x = 80
x = 80 - 4x
x = 80 / 5
x = 16

Answer: 16
