Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of passengers that each carriage can hold. Each carriage can hold 10 passengers.

Now, we are asked how many passengers would fill up 3 trains. Since each train has 4 carriages, and each carriage can hold 10 passengers, we need to multiply the number of carriages by the number of passengers each carriage can hold. This would be:

4 carriages x 10 passengers per carriage = 40 passengers per train

Now, we want to know how many passengers would fill up 3 trains. So, we need to multiply the number of passengers per train by 3:

40 passengers per train x 3 trains = 120 passengers

So, the answer is:

Answer: 120
