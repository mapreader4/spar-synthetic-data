Let's start by using the information given to find the total amount of money she made from selling the shirts. She sold 4 shirts for 5 dollars each, so the total amount of money from selling shirts is 4 * 5 = 20 dollars. The total amount of money she made in total is 69 dollars, and she made 20 dollars from selling shirts, so the total amount of money from dresses is 69 - 20 = 49. Since she sold 7 dresses, we can divide the total amount of money from dresses, 49, by 7 to find the amount she made from each dress. 49 divided by 7 is 7. 

Answer: 7
