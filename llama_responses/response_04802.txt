Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The vacuum cleaner lasts 10 minutes.
2. Mary has 3 bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. So, the total number of rooms to be vacuumed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
3. Mary needs to vacuum each room, so she needs to vacuum 5 times.
4. Each room takes 4 minutes to vacuum, so the total time needed to vacuum the whole house is 5 x 4 = 20 minutes.
5. Since the vacuum cleaner lasts 10 minutes, Mary needs to charge it 20 / 10 = 2 times to vacuum the whole house.
