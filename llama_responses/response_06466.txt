Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The gardener buys 250 tulips, which costs 2€ each. So, the cost of tulips is 250 x 2 = 500€.

2. The gardener buys 375 carnations, which costs 2€ each. So, the cost of carnations is 375 x 2 = 750€.

3. The gardener buys 320 roses, which costs 2€ each. So, the cost of roses is 320 x 2 = 640€.

4. To find the total cost, we add the cost of tulips, carnations, and roses: 500€ + 750€ + 640€ = 1900€.

Answer: 1900€
