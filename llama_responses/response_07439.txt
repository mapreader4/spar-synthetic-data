Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of oranges, which is 96.

Half of the oranges were ripe, so 96 / 2 = 48 were ripe oranges.

1/4 of the ripe oranges were eaten, so 48 / 4 = 12 ripe oranges were eaten.

1/8 of the unripe oranges were eaten, so 96 / 8 = 12 unripe oranges were eaten.

The total number of oranges eaten is the sum of the ripe and unripe oranges eaten, which is 12 + 12 = 24.

Answer: 24
