To find the percentage chance that the cheese stick is pepperjack, we need to find the total number of pepperjack sticks and divide that by the total number of sticks in the pack.

There are 15 cheddar sticks and 45 pepperjack sticks. So, the total number of sticks in the pack is 15 + 45 = 60.

So, the number of pepperjack sticks is 45 out of a total of 60 sticks. To find the percentage, we divide 45 by 60.

45 / 60 = 0.75 = 0.75

So, the chance that the cheese stick is pepperjack is 0.75 or 75%.
