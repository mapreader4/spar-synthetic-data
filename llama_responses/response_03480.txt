Let's break this down step by step:

1. Chelsea made 4 batches of cupcakes.
2. Each batch took 20 minutes to bake.
3. Each batch took 30 minutes to ice.

To find the total time taken to make the cupcakes, we need to multiply the baking time by the number of batches, and then add the icing time.

20 minutes per batch * 4 = 80 minutes (baking time)
30 minutes per batch * 4 = 120 minutes (icing time)

Total time = Baking time + Icing time = 80 + 120 = 200 minutes

Answer: 200
