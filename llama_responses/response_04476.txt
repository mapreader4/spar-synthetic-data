Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the given information: "They planted 3 times as many peaches as apricot trees." We can represent this as a multiplication problem.

Let's set up an equation to represent the problem: 3x = 58.

We know that 3 x? = 58. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: 3x รท 3 = 58 รท 3.

This gives us: x = 19.

So, the total number of trees planted is 3 x 19 = 57.
