Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Find the area of the courtyard.

The courtyard measures 10 feet by 25 feet, so its area is:

Area = length x width = 10 x 25 = 250 square feet

Step 2: Determine how many tiles are needed.

Since Jackson needs 4 tiles per square foot, and the area is 250 square feet, he needs:

250 x 4 = 1000 tiles

Step 3: Calculate the number of green marble tiles.

40% of the tiles are green marble, so 40% of 1000 tiles are green marble. To find 40% of 1000, we can multiply 1000 by 0.4:

1000 x 0.4 = 400 green marble tiles

Step 4: Calculate the number of red tiles.

The remaining tiles are red, and there are 1000 - 400 = 600 red tiles.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the green marble tiles.

The green marble tiles cost $3/tile, and there are 400 of them. The cost is:

400 x 3 = 1200

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the red tiles.

The red tiles cost $1.50/tile, and there are 600 of them. The cost is:

600 x 1.50 = 900

Step 7: Add the cost of the green and red tiles.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green and red tiles:

1200 + 900 = 2100

Answer: 2100
