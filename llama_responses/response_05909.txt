Let's start by counting the wheels of each object:

1. 2 cars have 2 wheels each, so that is 2 x 2 = 4 wheels.
2. 2 bikes have 2 wheels each, so that is 2 x 2 = 4 wheels.
3. The trash can has 2 wheels.
4. The tricycle has 3 wheels.
5. The pair of roller skates has 2 wheels.

Now, let's add up the total number of wheels: 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 15

So, there are 15 wheels in total.
