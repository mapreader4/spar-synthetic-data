Let's break this down step by step.

Xander read 20% of his 500-page book in one hour. 20% of 500 is 100 pages. So, he has read 100 pages in one hour. 

The next night, he read another 20% of the book. 20% of 500 is 100 pages. So, he read another 100 pages.

On the third night, he read 30% of his book. 30% of 500 is 150 pages. So, he read 150 more pages.

So, he read 100 + 100 + 150 = 250 pages in total. There are 500 - 250 = 250 pages left to read. 

Answer: 250
