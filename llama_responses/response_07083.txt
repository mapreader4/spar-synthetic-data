Let's break this down step by step:

Lois has 40 books initially.
She gives a fourth of her books to her nephew, which is 40 / 4 = 10 books.
So, she has 40 - 10 = 30 books left.
Then, she donates a third of her remaining books to the library, which is 30 / 3 = 10 books.
So, she has 30 - 10 = 20 books left.
Then, she purchases 3 new books, so she now has 20 + 3 = 23 books.

Answer: 23
