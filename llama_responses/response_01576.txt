Let's break this problem down step by step.

Pogo, the four-legged martian, leaves 4 footprints every meter. Since Pogo travels 6000 meters, the total number of footprints it will leave is:

4 footprints/meter × 6000 meters = 24,000 footprints

Grimzi, the three-legged Plutonian, leaves 3 footprints in the soft sands of Pluto for every 6 meters it walks. Since Grimzi travels 6000 meters, we need to find the number of 6-meter intervals it will cover:

6000 meters ÷ 6 meters/interval = 1000 intervals

Now, we can find the total number of footprints Grimzi will leave:

3 footprints/6 meters × 1000 intervals = 5000 footprints

To find the combined total number of footprints, we add the number of footprints left by Pogo and Grimzi:

24,000 footprints + 5000 footprints = 28,000 footprints

Answer: 28000
