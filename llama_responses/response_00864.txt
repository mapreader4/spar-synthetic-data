Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the number of coffee cups brewed per day.

The coffee shop brews 10 coffee cups per hour on a weekday. Since the coffee shop is open 5 hours a day, the number of coffee cups brewed per day is:

10 coffee cups per hour x 5 hours = 50 coffee cups per day.

Now, let's find the total number of coffee cups brewed in a week.

The coffee shop brews 120 coffee cups in total over the weekend. This is the total number of coffee cups brewed over the 2 non-working days (Saturday and Sunday).

The total number of coffee cups brewed in a week is the total of the number of coffee cups brewed per day, which is 50, multiplied by the number of working days in a week, which is 7, minus the number of non-working days, which is 2. So:

50 coffee cups per day x 7 days - 2 days = 350 coffee cups.

So, the total number of coffee cups brewed in a week is 350.

Answer: 350
