Let's start by identifying the total amount of cleaner used to clean the dog, cat, and rabbit stains.

For the dog, Marcy uses 6 ounces of cleaner.
For the cat, Marcy uses 4 ounces of cleaner.
For the rabbit, Marcy uses 1 ounce of cleaner.

To find the total amount of cleaner used, we can add the amount of cleaner used for each animal:

6 ounces (for the dog) + 4 ounces (for the cat) + 1 ounce (for the rabbit) = 11 ounces

So, Marcy uses a total of 11 ounces of cleaner.
