Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run. Since Milo can run at some speed, let's call that speed r. Then, we know that Cory can drive his wheelchair at twice that speed, which is 2r. We are given that Cory drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour. So, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2r = 12

We can solve for r by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

r = 12 / 2
r = 6

So, Milo can run at 6 miles per hour. To find the distance Milo can run in two hours, we can multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 6 * 2
Distance = 12

Answer: 12
