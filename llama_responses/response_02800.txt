Let's break it down step by step.

There are 20 boys in the second grade. There are 11 girls in the second grade. So, the total number of students in the second grade is 20 + 11 = 31.

In the third grade, there are twice the number of students as in the second grade. So, in the third grade, there are 2 * 31 = 62 students.

So, the total number of students in grades 2 and 3 is 31 + 62 = 93.
