Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Susie has 200 dollars in her piggy bank.

If she puts 20% more money into her piggy bank, that means she is adding 20% of the 200 dollars she already has.

20% of 200 is the same as 0.2 * 200, which is 40.

So, she will have 200 + 40 = 240 dollars in her piggy bank.

Answer: 240
