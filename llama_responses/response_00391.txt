Let's break this down step by step.

Tony went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science. Then he went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time. That is 2 more years.

Then he got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.

So in total, Tony went to school for 4 + 2 + 2 = 6 years.
