Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total number of holes that Maynard dug in the lawn. We know that Maynard dug 8 holes, but then he filled in 75% of the holes with dirt. 

We can find the total number of holes by multiplying the number of holes by the fraction 75%: 8 * 0.75 = 6. 

So, 6 holes are filled in with dirt, and 2 holes are unfilled.
