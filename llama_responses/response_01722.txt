Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Skye drove 6 kilometers in total. For the first 3 kilometers, his speed was 150 kilometers per hour. To find the time it took him to cover this distance, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 3 kilometers / 150 kilometers per hour
= 0.02 hours

So, it took Skye 0.02 hours to cover the first 3 kilometers.

Next, for the next 2 kilometers, his speed was 50 kilometers per hour more, which means his speed was:

150 kilometers per hour + 50 kilometers per hour = 200 kilometers per hour

Using the same formula, we can find the time it took him to cover the next 2 kilometers:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 2 kilometers / 200 kilometers per hour
= 0.01 hours

So, it took Skye 0.01 hours to cover the next 2 kilometers.

For the remaining 1 kilometer, his speed was twice as fast as his speed on the first 3 kilometers, which is:

150 kilometers per hour x 2 = 300 kilometers per hour

Using the same formula, we can find the time it took him to cover the remaining 1 kilometer:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 1 kilometer / 300 kilometers per hour
= 0.0033 hours

So, it took Skye 0.0033 hours to cover the remaining 1 kilometer.

Now, we can find Skye's total time for the entire race by adding up the times it took him to cover each section:

Total time = 0.02 hours + 0.01 hours + 0.0033 hours
= 0.0253 hours

Finally, we can find Skye's average speed for the entire race by dividing the total distance by his total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 6 kilometers / 0.0253 hours
= 237.3 kilometers per hour

Answer: 237
