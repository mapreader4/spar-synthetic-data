Let's break this down step by step.

1. An amoeba reproduces every two days. This means that after two days, it will split into two amoebae.
2. After four days, it will split into four amoebae.
3. After six days, it will split into eight amoebae.
4. After eight days, it will split into 16 amoebae.

So, it will take four days for the amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.
