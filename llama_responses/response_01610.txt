Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the amount of water Micah drank in the morning. She drank 1.5 liters of water in the morning. That's the first part of the problem.

Next, let's identify the amount of water she drank in the afternoon. She drank three times the amount she drank in the morning. Since she drank 1.5 liters in the morning, that means she drank 1.5 x 3 = 4.5 liters of water in the afternoon.

To find the total amount of water she drank from the morning until the afternoon, we need to add the amount she drank in the morning and the amount she drank in the afternoon. So, the total amount of water she drank is 1.5 + 4.5 = 5.5 liters.
