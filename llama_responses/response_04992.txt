Let's start by finding the actual mileage per gallon that Pria got. Since she drove 372 miles on 12 gallons of gas, we can set up a proportion to find the mileage per gallon:

372 miles / 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon

The advertised mileage is 35 miles per gallon. To find the difference between the two, we subtract the actual mileage from the advertised mileage:

35 miles per gallon - 31 miles per gallon = 4 miles per gallon

So, the difference between Pria's mileage and the advertised mileage is 4 miles per gallon.

Answer: 4
