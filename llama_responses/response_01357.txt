Let's start by first finding the total amount of money Lizzy received from her mother and father. Her mother gave her 80 cents, and her father gave her 40 cents. 80 + 40 = 120. So Lizzy had 120 cents initially.

Then, she spent 50 cents on candy for her little cousin. 120 - 50 = 70. So she had 70 cents left.

Then, her uncle gave her another 70 cents. 70 + 70 = 140. So Lizzy now has 140 cents.

Answer: 140
