Let's start by using the information given. We know that Taquon and Mack together had 418 pieces of candy. If Taquon and Mack each had 171 pieces of candy, then the total number of pieces of candy that they had together is 171 * 2 = 342. Since Jafari had some of the candy, the number of pieces of candy Jafari had is 418 - 342 = 76. So, Jafari started with 76 pieces of candy.
