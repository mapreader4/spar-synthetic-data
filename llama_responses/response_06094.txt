Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total time Walter spent at the zoo.

Walter spent 2 hours and 10 minutes, which is equal to 2 * 60 + 10 = 70 minutes.

Now, let's find the time spent looking at the seals.

Walter spent 8 times as long looking at the penguins, so the time spent looking at the penguins is 8 * 8 = 64 minutes.

Adding the time spent looking at the seals and the penguins, we get 64 +? minutes.

Walter spent 13 minutes looking at the elephants, so the total time spent looking at the seals, penguins, and elephants is 64 + 13 = 77 minutes.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 77
