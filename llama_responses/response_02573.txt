Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of problems that Bill, Ryan, and Frank need to compose.

Bill composes 20 problems, so that's 20 problems.

Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill, so Ryan composes 2 * 20 = 40 problems.

Frank composes 3 times as many problems as Ryan, so Frank composes 3 * 40 = 120 problems.

Now, we need to find the total number of problems that they need to compose. This is the sum of the number of problems each of them composes:

20 + 40 + 120 = 180

So, they need to compose 180 problems in total.

Now, each of them need to compose 180 / 3 types of problems in equal proportion. So, the number of problems of each type that Frank needs to compose is:

180 / 3 = 60.

Answer: 60
