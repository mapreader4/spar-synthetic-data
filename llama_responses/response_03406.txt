Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of baths that Isabelle needs to run. There are 13 rooms for couples and 14 single rooms, so the total number of rooms is 27.

Next, let's find the total capacity of the baths. Each bath requires 10ml of bubble bath, and each room is filled to maximum capacity. So, the total capacity is 27 x 10 = 270ml.

So, Isabelle needs 270ml of bubble bath.
