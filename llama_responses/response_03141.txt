Let's break it down step by step.

John eats 3 meals a day, and each meal has calories. So, we know that his daily total calories are 3 * 500 = 1500. His lunch has 25% more calories than his breakfast, so his lunch is 1.25 * 500 = 625 calories. His dinner is twice as many calories as his lunch, so his dinner is 2 * 625 = 1250 calories. He also has 3 shakes that are each 300 calories, so his total calories from shakes are 3 * 300 = 900. To find his total daily calories, we add his meals and shakes together: 1500 + 625 + 1250 + 900 = 3375. Answer: 3375
