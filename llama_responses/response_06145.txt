Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's assume the machine can fill a barrel of soda in 3 minutes under normal circumstances.

Since the machine took 5 minutes to fill one barrel this morning due to the leak, it means that the leak is wasting 2 minutes for every barrel.

To find the total time it will take to fill 12 barrels, we need to calculate the total time wasted due to the leak. Since the leak is wasting 2 minutes per barrel, for 12 barrels, the total time wasted would be:

2 minutes per barrel * 12 barrels = 24 minutes

The machine would normally take 3 minutes to fill a barrel, so the total time to fill 12 barrels would be:

3 minutes per barrel * 12 barrels = 36 minutes

However, the machine took 24 minutes to fill the 12 barrels due to the leak, so the actual time it will take to fill the 12 barrels would be:

36 minutes + 24 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 60
