Let's break this down step by step.

1. Jenna drives for 2 hours at 60mph. She covers a distance of 2 x 60 = 120 miles.

2. After taking a break, she drives for 3 hours at 50 mph. She covers a distance of 3 x 50 = 150 miles.

3. The total distance she drives is 120 + 150 = 270 miles.

4. Jenna can drive 30 miles on one gallon of gas. 30 miles is the distance she drives in the last hour. Since she drove for 3 hours at 50 mph, she drives at a speed of 50 mph for 1 hour. 50 x 1 = 50 miles. 50 miles is the distance she drives in the last hour. The distance she drove in the last hour is 50 - 30 = 20 miles. So she has 30 miles left to go.

5. She has 30 miles left to go and she can drive 30 miles on one gallon of gas. She has used 20 miles of gas in the last hour. She has 30 - 20 = 10 miles left to go. 10 miles is the distance she can drive on one gallon of gas. 10 miles is the distance she can drive on one gallon of gas.

6. 1 gallon of gas costs $2. Jenna spends 10 / 1 = 10 x 2 = 20 dollars on gas.

Answer: 20
