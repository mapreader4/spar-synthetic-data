Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Donna makes 20 sandwiches. She cuts them in half, so now she has 20 / 2 = 10 halves.

Step 2: She cuts the halves in half again, so now she has 10 halves / 2 = 5 quarters.

Step 3: She gives everyone 8 portions. Since each quarter is a portion, she can feed 5 people.
