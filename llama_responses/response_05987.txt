Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of carbon dioxide released by using plastic bags.

Since each plastic bag releases 4 ounces of carbon dioxide, and Marla uses 8 bags per shopping trip, the total amount of carbon dioxide released by using plastic bags is:

8 bags per trip x 4 ounces per bag = 32 ounces per trip

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total amount of carbon dioxide released by using plastic bags from ounces to pounds:

32 ounces per trip รท 16 ounces per pound = 2 pounds per trip

Step 2: Calculate the carbon dioxide released by the canvas bag.

The canvas bag releases 600 pounds of carbon dioxide.

Step 3: Compare the carbon dioxide released by the canvas bag to the carbon dioxide released by plastic bags.

To find the number of trips needed to equal the carbon dioxide released by the canvas bag, we can divide the carbon dioxide released by the canvas bag by the carbon dioxide released by plastic bags per trip:

600 pounds (canvas bag) รท 2 pounds (plastic bags per trip) = 300 trips

Answer: 300
