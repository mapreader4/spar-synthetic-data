Let's break it down step by step.

Tom has 10 packages of miniature racing cars, and each package contains 5 cars. So, the total number of cars Tom has is 10 x 5 = 50.

Tom gives his two nephews 1/5 of the cars. To find 1/5 of 50, we need to divide 50 by 5. 50 divided by 5 is 10. So, Tom gives each of his nephews 10 cars.

After giving away 10 cars to his nephews, Tom is left with 50 - 10 = 40 cars.

Answer: 40
