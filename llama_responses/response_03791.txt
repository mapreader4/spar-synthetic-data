Let's break it down step by step.

1. Susan earned $600 from babysitting over the summer.
2. She spent half of it on clothes, which is 600 / 2 = 300.
3. She had 600 - 300 = 300 left.
4. She spent half of what was left on books, which is 300 / 2 = 150.
5. After spending 150 on books, she had 300 - 150 = 150 left.
