To find the area of the first rectangle, we multiply the width and height together. The area of the first rectangle is 4 inches * 5 inches = 20 square inches.

To find the area of the second rectangle, we multiply the width and height together. The area of the second rectangle is 3 inches * 6 inches = 18 square inches.

To find the difference in the areas, we subtract the area of the second rectangle from the area of the first. The difference is 20 - 18 = 2 square inches.
