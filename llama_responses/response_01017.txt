Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of berries that Skylar has. We are given that Skylar has 20 berries.

We know that Steve has one half as many berries as Skylar. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Steve's berries = 1/2 * Skylar's berries

We know that Skylar has 20 berries, so we can substitute that in the equation:

Steve's berries = 1/2 * 20

To solve for Steve's berries, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

Steve's berries = 1/2 * 2 * 20

Steve's berries = 10

So, Steve has 10 berries.

Now, we can use this information to find out how many berries Stacy has. We know that Stacy has 2 more than triple as many berries as Steve. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Stacy's berries = 3 * Steve's berries

We know that Steve has 10 berries, so we can substitute that in the equation:

Stacy's berries = 3 * 10

To solve for Stacy's berries, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get:

Stacy's berries = 30

So, Stacy has 30 berries.

Answer: 30
