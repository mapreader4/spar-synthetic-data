Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the first shirt costs $15. We also know that the second shirt costs $6 more than the first shirt. So, we can set up an equation to represent the cost of the second shirt: 15 + 6 = x. To solve for x, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to get x = 21. Since we are trying to find the total cost of the shirts, we add the cost of both shirts together, which is 15 + 21 = 36. So, the answer is: Answer: 36.
