Let's break it down step by step.

Selena started with 99 dollars.

She spent 2 x 24 dollars on the 2 steak meals, so that's 48 dollars gone.

She spent 2 x 3.5 dollars on the 2 types of burgers, so that's 7 dollars gone.

She spent 3 x 2 dollars on the 3 cups of ice cream, so that's 6 dollars gone.

Adding up the total spent, we get 48 + 7 + 6 = 61 dollars gone.

So, Selena is left with 99 - 61 = 38 dollars.
