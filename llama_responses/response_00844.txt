Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "Rahim is 6 now." This tells us that Rahim is 6 years old now.

We want to know how many years older Andy is than Rahim is right now. To find this out, we can subtract Rahim's age from the age Andy will be in 5 years. 

In 5 years, Andy will be 11 years old. So, we can set up the equation: 

11 - 6 =? 

Subtracting 6 from 11 gives us 5. So, the answer is: 

Answer: 5
