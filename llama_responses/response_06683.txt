To find the percentage of apples in the basket, we need to first find the total number of fruits in the basket after Emily adds 5 more oranges. There were originally 10 apples and 5 oranges, so there were 15 fruits in total. Then, after Emily adds 5 more oranges, there are 10 + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20 fruits in the basket. The number of apples is still 10, so the percentage of apples in the basket is 10/20 = 0.5 = 50%.
