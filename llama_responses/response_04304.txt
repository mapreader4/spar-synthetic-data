Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the age of Rachel's mother. We know that her mother is half of Rachel's grandfather's age, and her grandfather is 7 times Rachel's age. So, Rachel's mother's age is half of 12, which is 6.

Now, we know that Rachel's father is 5 years older than her mother. So, Rachel's father's age is 6 + 5 = 11.

Now, we want to know how old Rachel's father will be when Rachel is 25 years old. Since Rachel is currently 12 years old, 13 years will pass until she is 25 years old. Rachel's father is currently 11 years old, so 13 years from now, he will be 11 + 13 = 24 years old.
