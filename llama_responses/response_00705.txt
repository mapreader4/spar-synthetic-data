Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the amount of money Isabel had initially is x.

She spent half of the amount, which is x/2.

She then spent half of the remaining money, which is (x - x/2)/2 = (x/2)/2.

So, she has x - (x/2) left.

We know that she has 51 dollars left, so x - (x/2) = 51.

We can solve for x:

x - (x/2) = 51
x - x/2 = 51
x - x/2 + x/2 = 51
x - x = 102

So, x = 102.

Answer: 102
