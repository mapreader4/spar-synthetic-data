Let's break down the given information step by step.

The store makes 36 sales. It makes a third of its sales in the fabric section. So, a third of 36 is 12. So, 12 sales were in the fabric section.

The store also makes a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section. A quarter of 36 is 9. So, 9 sales were in the jewelry section.

The rest of the sales were in the stationery section. Since the total sales are 36, and 12 were in the fabric section and 9 were in the jewelry section, the remaining sales must be 15. So, 15 sales were in the stationery section.
