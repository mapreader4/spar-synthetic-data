Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the length of each CD.

The first two CDs are 1.5 hours each. So, the total length of these two CDs is 1.5 + 1.5 = 2.5 hours.

The last CD is twice as long as the first two, so it is 2 * 1.5 = 3 hours.

The combined length of the CDs is the sum of the lengths of the first two CDs and the last CD:

2.5 + 3 = 5.5 hours.

Answer: 5.5
