Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* John travels 15 miles on a bike ride.
* Jill travels 5 miles less than John.
* Jim travels only 20% as far as Jill.

Let's identify the variable: Let's say the distance Jim travels be x.

The information given in the problem tells us that Jill travels 5 miles less than John. So, we can set up an equation:

15 - 5 = x

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

15 - 5 = x
x = 10

So, Jim travels 10 miles.

Answer: 10
