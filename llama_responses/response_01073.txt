Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of fish that swim eastward and westward.

The fish that swim eastward are 3,200, and the fish that swim westward are 1,800. So, the total number of fish that swim in any direction is 1,800 + 3,200 = 4,000.

Now, the problem asks us to find the number of fish left in the sea, which is 2/5 of the fish that swim eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swim westward.

2/5 of the fish that swim eastward is 3,200 * 2/5 = 1,600. 3/4 of the fish that swim westward is 1,800 * 3/4 = 1,350. The total number of fish left in the sea is 1,600 + 1,350 = 2,950.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 2,950
