Let's break down the problem step by step.

Agatha has $60 to spend on a new bike. She spends $15 on the frame, which leaves her with:

$60 - $15 = $45

She then spends $25 on the front wheel, which leaves her with:

$45 - $25 = $20

So, Agatha has $20 left to spend on a seat and handlebar tape.
