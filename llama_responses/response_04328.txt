Let's break it down step by step.

The fisherman gets 8 Red snappers and 14 Tunas every day. 

Let's find the cost of the Red snappers first. The cost of 8 Red snappers is 8 * 3 = 24 dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of the Tunas. The cost of 14 Tunas is 14 * 2 = 28 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the Red snappers and the cost of the Tunas. The total cost is 24 + 28 = 52 dollars.

Answer: 52
