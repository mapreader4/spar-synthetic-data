Let's start by using the given information to set up an equation. We know that 70% of the students are men. We know that 180 are women, so the total number of students are 180 + x, where x is the number of men. We can set up the equation as follows:

0.7x = 180

We can then solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 180 / 0.7

x = 250

So, there are 250 men in the engineering department.
