Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: James bought 200 toys at $20 each. So, he spent 200 * 20 = $4000 to buy the toys.

Step 2: He sells the toys for $30 each. So, he gets 80% of 200 toys * $30 = 1600 dollars.

Step 3: To find out how much money he has more after selling the toys, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he got. So, 4000 - 1600 = 2400.

Answer: 2400
