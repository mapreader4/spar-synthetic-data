Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of roses sold. Since there were 10 rose bouquets, and each bouquet contains 12 roses, the total number of roses sold is:

10 bouquets x 12 roses/bouquet = 120 roses

Since the total number of flowers sold is 190, and 120 of those flowers are roses, the number of daisies sold is:

190 flowers - 120 roses = 70 daisies

Since there were 10 daisy bouquets, the number of daisies in each bouquet is:

70 daisies รท 10 bouquets = 7 daisies per bouquet

Answer: 7
