Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of blue balls is x.

Since there are 11 blue balls, we know that 2x = 11.

To find the number of green balls, we need to subtract the number of blue balls from the total number of balls.

The total number of balls is 40, and the number of blue balls is 11. So, we can subtract 11 from 40 to get the number of green balls.

40 - 11 = 29

Answer: 29
