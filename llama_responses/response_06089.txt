Let's start by calculating the total weight of the ravioli eaten by Javier.

Javier ate 5 meat ravioli, which weigh 1.5 ounces each, so the total weight of the meat ravioli is:
5 x 1.5 = 7.5 ounces

Javier also ate 2 pumpkin ravioli, which weigh 1.25 ounces each, so the total weight of the pumpkin ravioli is:
2 x 1.25 = 2.5 ounces

Javier also ate 4 cheese ravioli, which weigh 1 ounce each, so the total weight of the cheese ravioli is:
4 x 1 = 4 ounces

The total weight of the ravioli eaten by Javier is the sum of the weights of the three types of ravioli:
7.5 + 2.5 + 4 = 14 ounces

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the ravioli eaten by Javier's brother. His brother ate 12 pumpkin ravioli, which weigh 1.25 ounces each, so the total weight of the pumpkin ravioli is:
12 x 1.25 = 15 ounces

Since Javier's brother ate more ounces of ravioli, he is the winner.

Answer: 15
