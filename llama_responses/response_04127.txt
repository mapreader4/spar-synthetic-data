Let's break this down step by step.

Let's let's start by identifying the number of daisies sold on the first day. We are told that the flower shop sold 45 daisies on the first day.

On the second day, they sold 20 more flowers than they did on the first day. So, the number of daisies sold on the second day is 45 + 20 = 65.

On the third day, they sold 10 less than twice the flowers that were sold on the second day. So, the number of daisies sold on the third day is 65 - 10 = 55.

Now, the flower shop sold a total of 350 daisies for 4 days. The number of daisies sold on the 4th day is what is left over after the number of daisies sold on the first 3 days. We can set up an equation to solve for this:

Let x be the number of daisies sold on the 4th day. The equation is:

45 + 65 + 55 + x = 350

We can solve for x by subtracting 45 + 65 from both sides of the equation:

x = 350 - (45 + 65) = 240

Answer: 240
