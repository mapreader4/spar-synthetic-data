Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

Let's identify the information given:

* The recipe requires 6 pounds of eggs.
* An egg weighs 1/16 of a pound.

To find the number of eggs needed, we can set up a proportion:

Let's convert the fraction to a decimal: 1/16 = 0.0625.

Since we want to find the number of eggs needed for 6 pounds, we can multiply 0.0625 by 6:

0.0625 * 6 = 0.375

Since we want to know the number of eggs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Since 0.375 is less than 1, we round up to 1.

Answer: 1
