Let's break down the problem step by step.

Alexis started with a budget of $200.

She spent $30 on a button-up shirt, leaving her with:

$200 - $30 = $170

Then, she spent $46 on suit pants, leaving her with:

$170 - $46 = $124

Next, she spent $38 on a suit coat, leaving her with:

$124 - $38 = $86

After that, she spent $11 on socks, leaving her with:

$86 - $11 = $75

Then, she spent $18 on a belt, leaving her with:

$75 - $18 = $57

Finally, she has $16 left from her budget, which means she spent:

$200 - $16 = $184

on the shoes. However, she didn't have $184 left, so she must have spent more than that. Let's subtract the total amount she spent on the other items from her initial budget:

$200 - ($30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18) = $200 - $143 = $57

This is the amount she had left after buying all the other items except the shoes. Since she has $16 left, she must have spent:

$57 - $16 = $41

on the shoes.

Answer: 41
