Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the six-pack of muffins. Since it's two times more expensive than the cheesecake, and we know that one cheesecake is 25% cheaper than the apple pie, we can set up an equation to represent the cost of the six-pack of muffins:

Let x be the cost of the cheesecake. Then, the cost of the six-pack of muffins is 2x, and the cost of the apple pie is x + (25% of x).

We know the cost of the apple pie is $12, so we can set up the equation: x + (25% of x) = 12.

To solve for x, we can subtract 25% of x from both sides of the equation: x + (25% of x) - 25% of x = 12 - 25% of x.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 12 - 25% of x.

We can solve for x by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation: x - 12 = -25% of x.

Now, we can convert the percentage to a decimal: -25% = -0.25.

Subtracting 0.25x from both sides of the equation, we get: x - 12 = -0.25x.

Adding 12 to both sides of the equation, we get: x = 12 - 0.25x.

We can now find the cost of the cheesecake by solving for x: x = 12 - 0.25x.

Since the cost of the six-pack of muffins is 2x, we can substitute 2x for x in the equation: 2x = 12 - 0.25(2x).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 12 - 0.5x.

We can solve for 2x by adding 0.5x to both sides of the equation: 2x + 0.5x = 12.

Combining like terms, we get: 2.5x = 12.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2.5, we get: x = 12/2.5.

x = 4.8.

The cost of the cheesecake is $4.8, and the cost of the six-pack of muffins is 2 times that: 2(4.8) = 9.6.

The cost of the apple pie is $12, and the cost of the two cheesecakes is 2(4.8) = 9.6. To find the total cost, we add the costs: 9.6 + 9.6 + 12 = 31.
