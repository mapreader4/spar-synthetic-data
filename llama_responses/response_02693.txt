Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find the taxable income. The first $20,000 of income is taxed at 10%, so we'll subtract that from the total income, leaving us with $80,000. Then, the remaining income is taxed at 20%, so we'll multiply that by 20% and subtract that from the remaining income.
