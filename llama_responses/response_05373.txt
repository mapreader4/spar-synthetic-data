Let's break this down step by step.

Jim's bi-weekly gross pay is $1120. He has 25% of his paycheck go into his retirement account. That means that 25% of his paycheck is $1120 * 0.25 = $280. So, we subtract $280 from his paycheck.

After that, $100 is taken out for taxes. So, we subtract $100 from what's left.

So, we have $1120 - $280 - $100 = $740.

So, the amount left on Jim's paycheck is:

Answer: 740
