Let's break this down step by step.

Violet needs 800 ml of water per hour for herself, and her dog needs 400 ml of water per hour. So, the total amount of water they need is 800 + 400 = 1200 ml per hour.

Violet can carry 4.8 L of water. To convert this to milliliters, we can multiply 4.8 L by 1000 to get 4800 ml. Since Violet can carry 4800 ml of water, and they need 1200 ml per hour, we can divide 4800 by 1200 to get the number of hours they can hike:

4800 รท 1200 = 4

So, Violet can hike for 4 hours with her dog.
