Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: We are given that Bryan bought 3 bottles of milk. We are also given the volumes of milk in each bottle, which are 2 liters, 750 milliliters, and 250 milliliters.

Step 2: To find the total volume of milk Bryan bought, we need to add the volumes of milk from each bottle.

Step 3: We add the volumes of milk from each bottle: 2 liters + 750 milliliters + 250 milliliters = 2 + 0.75 + 0.25 = 2.75 liters.

Answer: 2.75
