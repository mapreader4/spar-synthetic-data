Let's break down the information given into variables:

Let's say Esperanza's monthly rent be r, her monthly food expenses be f, and her monthly mortgage be 3f.

We know that 3f = r, so f = r/3.

We are given that she saves 2000 and pays 2/5 of her savings in taxes. So, we can set up an equation for her savings:

2000 = r - 2f/5

We also know that her monthly salary is the sum of her rent, food expenses, and mortgage:

r + f + 3f

We can substitute the expression for f with the expression 3f = r, and simplify the equation:

r + r + 3r

Now, we can substitute the expression for r with the equation for her savings:

r + r + 3r = 2000 - 2r/5

We can solve for r:

r = (2000 - 2r/5 - 4r)/2

r = 1000 - r

r = 500

So, her monthly salary is 500 + 500 + 1500 = 2000.

Answer: 2000
