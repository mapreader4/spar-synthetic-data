Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the weight of each weight.

Each weight is 30 pounds.

The total weight of all the weights is 10 x 30 = 300 pounds.

The weights are made 20% heavier on the lowering portion, so we need to find 20% of the total weight.

To find 20% of 300, we can multiply 300 by 0.2.

300 x 0.2 = 60

So the weights feel 60 pounds heavier when being lowered.
