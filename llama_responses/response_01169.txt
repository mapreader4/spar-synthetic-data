Let's break it down step by step.

Ben has 4 boxes with 10 basketball cards each, so he has a total of 4 * 10 = 40 basketball cards.

His mother gave him 5 boxes with 8 baseball cards, so he has a total of 5 * 8 = 40 baseball cards.

Ben gives 58 cards to his classmates. We need to find out how many cards he has left.

We can find the total number of cards he has by adding the number of basketball cards and baseball cards: 40 + 40 = 80.

He gives away 58 cards, so he has 80 - 58 = 22 cards left.

Answer: 22
