Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Nathaniel has 11 tickets initially.

Nathaniel gives away 2 tickets to his best friends. Let's call this number of friends x.

After giving away 2 tickets, Nathaniel has 11 - 2 = 9 tickets left.

This means that Nathaniel has 9 tickets left.

So, Nathaniel has 9 best friends.
