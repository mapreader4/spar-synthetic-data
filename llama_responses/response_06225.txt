Let's break it down step by step.

Pedro has 200 squares. Jesus has 60 squares. Linden has 75 squares. To find the total number of squares Jesus and Linden have, we add them together: 60 + 75 = 135. To find the difference between Pedro's squares and the number of squares Jesus and Linden have, we subtract 135 from 200. 200 - 135 = 65.

Answer: 65
