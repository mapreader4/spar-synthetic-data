Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the stadium has 60,000 seats, and 75% of those seats were sold. This means that 75% of 60,000 is the number of seats that were sold.

To find the number of seats sold, we can multiply 75% by 60,000. We can write this as a multiplication problem: 0.75 x 60,000.

To solve this problem, we can multiply 0.75 by 60,000. When we multiply 0.75 by 60,000, we get 45,000.

So, the number of seats sold is 45,000.

Answer: 45,000.
