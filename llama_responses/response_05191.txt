Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of US states. There are 50 states in the United States. So, Paul has plates from 40 states, which is 40/50 = 80% of the total number of states.

Now, for each percentage point of 80% of the total number of states, Paul's parents will give him $2. So, we can calculate the total amount he will earn as follows:

80% of 50 = 0.8 x 50 = 40

So, Paul will earn $2 for each of the 40 states, which is a total of:

40 x 2 = 80

Answer: 80
