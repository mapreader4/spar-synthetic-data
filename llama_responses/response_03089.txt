Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* In the first week, Tracy collects a certain number of books.
* In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week.

Let's represent the number of books she collected in the first week as x.

Then, in the next five weeks, she collects 10x books. So, the total number of books she collects in the next five weeks is 10x.

The total number of books she collects in the first week plus the number of books she collects in the next five weeks is 1x + 10x.

We know that the total number of books she collects now is 99. So, we can set up an equation:

1x + 10x = 99

To solve for x, we can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:

x + 10x - x = 99 - 1
10x = 98

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10 to get:

x = 98 / 9

x = 10.88

Since x must be an integer, we can round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, the whole number is 10.

So, Tracy collected 10 books in the first week.
