Let's break it down step by step.

1. The cans take up 30 square inches of space before being compacted.
2. 20% of 30 is 6 inches.
3. So, after being compacted, each can takes up 30 - 6 = 24 inches.
4. Since there are 60 cans, the total space taken up by all the cans after being compacted is 60 x 24 = 1440 inches.
5. But, since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we need to convert the total space taken up to feet. 1440 inches = 120 feet.

Answer: 120
