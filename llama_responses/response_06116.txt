Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding 30% of the total number of pine cones. 30% of 200 is 0.3 * 200 = 60.

So, 60 pine cones fall on Alan's roof. Each pine cone weighs 4 ounces. So, the total weight of the pine cones on Alan's roof is 4 * 60 = 240 ounces.

So, the answer is: Answer: 240.
