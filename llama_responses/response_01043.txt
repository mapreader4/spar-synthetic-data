Let's break down the cost of the items:

1. Living room set: $2500
2. Sectional: $3500
3. Everything else: $2000

The total cost of all the items is $2500 + $3500 + $2000 = $8000.

James gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1:

$8000 * 0.1 = $800

To get the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$8000 - $800 = $7120

Answer: 7120
