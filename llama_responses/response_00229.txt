Let's break it down step by step.

Jan starts with 1000 feet of cable, which is the total amount she has.

She splits it into 25-foot sections, so 1000 รท 25 = 40.

She gives 1/4 of that to a friend, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

So, she gives 10 feet to her friend.

She then puts half of the rest in storage, which is 40 - 10 = 30.

So, she puts 30 feet in storage.

She keeps the remaining 10 feet on hand.
