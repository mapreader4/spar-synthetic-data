Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of digits of pi that Carlos memorized. If Mina memorized 24 digits, and Mina memorized six times as many digits as Carlos, then Carlos memorized 24 / 6 = 4 digits of pi.

Now, we need to find the number of digits of pi that Sam memorized. We know that Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos, so Sam memorized 4 + 6 = 10 digits of pi.

Answer: 10
