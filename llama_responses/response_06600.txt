Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of slices of pie that Chef Michel sold.

For the shepherd's pie, he sold 52 slices to 52 customers. Each pie was cut into 4 pieces, so the total number of slices of shepherd's pie is 52 x 4 = 208 slices.

For the chicken pot pie, he sold 80 slices to 80 customers. Each pie was cut into 5 pieces, so the total number of slices of chicken pot pie is 80 x 5 = 400 slices.

To find the total number of pies Chef Michel sold, we add the number of slices of shepherd's pie to the number of slices of chicken pot pie: 208 + 400 = 608.

Answer: 608
