Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of birds initially.

There are 300 chickens, 200 turkeys, and 80 guinea fowls, so the total number of birds is:

300 + 200 + 80 = 480

Now, the disease is causing the farmer to lose birds every day. Let's identify how many birds are lost each day.

The farmer loses 20 chickens, 8 turkeys, and 5 guinea fowls each day, so the total number of birds lost each day is:

20 + 8 + 5 = 33

Since this happens every day, the total number of birds lost after a week is:

33 * 7 = 231

Now, the total number of birds left is the initial total minus the total number of birds lost.

480 - 231 = 249

So, the answer is:

Answer: 249
