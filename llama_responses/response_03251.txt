Let's break this problem down step by step.

Michael started with a pack of 5,000 rubber bands.

He used 50 rubber bands to make each small ball. Since he made 22 small balls, he used a total of 22 x 50 = 1,100 rubber bands.

That leaves him with 5,000 - 1,100 = 3,900 rubber bands.

He uses 300 rubber bands to make one large ball. To find out how many large balls he can make, I'll divide the remaining rubber bands by 300:

3,900 รท 300 = 13

Answer: 13
