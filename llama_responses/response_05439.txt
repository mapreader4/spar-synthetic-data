Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the regular size rubber ducks: 221 regular size ducks at $3.00 each is 221 x 3.00 = 663.00.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the large size rubber ducks: 185 large size ducks at $5.00 each is 185 x 5.00 = 925.00.

Then, we need to add the total cost of both sizes of ducks: 663.00 + 925.00 = 1588.00.

So, the city raised a total of 1588.00 dollars for charity.

Answer: 1588
