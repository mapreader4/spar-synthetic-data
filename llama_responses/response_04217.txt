Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of tourists initially. There are 30 tourists to start with.

Then, 2 tourists are eaten by anacondas, leaving 30 - 2 = 28 tourists.

Then, half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. So, 28 / 2 = 14 tourists get poisoned.

Then, if 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recover, 1/7 of 14 tourists recover.

So, the number of tourists left at the end of the tour is 14 - 1 = 13.

Answer: 13
