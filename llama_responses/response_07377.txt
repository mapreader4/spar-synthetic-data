To solve this problem, I will first convert each type of coin into dollars. 76 quarters is 76 x 0.25 = 19 dollars. 85 dimes is 85 x 0.10 = 8.5 dollars. 20 nickels is 20 x 0.05 = 1 dollar. 150 pennies is 150 x 0.01 = 1.5 dollars. So, in total, he has 19 + 8.5 + 1 + 1.5 = 29.5 dollars. After the 10% fee, he will receive 90% of this, which is 0.9 x 29.5 = 26.55. The answer is: Answer: 26.55.
