Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given. We know that Madeline has $48. We also know that her brother has half as much as her, which means that her brother has $24.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. To do this, we can simply add the two amounts together:

48 + 24 = 72

So, the answer is that they have $72 together.
