Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find the total amount of sleep John got in the past week.

For the days where he got 3 hours of sleep, the total sleep is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

For the remaining days, he got 0.6 * 8 = 4.8 hours of sleep.

Adding the sleep from both, we get 3 + 4.8 = 7.8 hours.

So, John got 7.8 hours of sleep this week.
