Let's break down the information given. Let's start by identifying the number of baseball cards. The problem states that there are 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards, so let's let's say that there are 50 - 50 = 0 football cards. The problem states that there are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards. So, we can set up an equation to represent this: 0 = 4x. We know that there are 200 hockey cards. So, we can solve for x, the number of football cards: x = 200 / 4 = 50. So, there are 50 football cards. The total number of cards is the sum of baseball, football, and hockey cards. So, let's add them together: 50 + 50 + 200 = 200. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 200
