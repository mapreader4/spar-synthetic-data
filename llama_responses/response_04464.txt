Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of the actors and food. The cost of the actors is $1200, and the cost of the food is 50 people * $3 = $150. The total cost of the actors and food is $1200 + $150 = $1350.

The equipment rental cost is twice as much as the actors and food combined, which is 2 * ($1200 + $150) = 2 * $1350 = $2700.

The total revenue from the movie is $10,000.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Profit = revenue - cost. Profit = $10,000 - $1350 - $2700 = $3350.

Answer: 3350
