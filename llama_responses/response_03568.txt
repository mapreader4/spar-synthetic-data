Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the pen. Marcel bought the pen for $4.

Next, we need to find the cost of the briefcase. The cost of the briefcase is 5 times the cost of the pen. Since the pen costs $4, the cost of the briefcase is 5 x 4 = 20.

To find the total cost of both items, we add the cost of the pen to the cost of the briefcase. The total cost is 4 + 20 = 24.
