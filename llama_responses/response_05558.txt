Let's start by letting x be the number of boys in the class. We know that the ratio of boys to girls is 5:8. So we can write an equation to represent this ratio:

x / (x + x) = 5/8

We can simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying both sides by 8:

(8x) / (8x) = 5

We can then cross multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

x / 8 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 8:

x = 5 * 8

x = 40

So the number of boys in the class is 40.
