Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that there were 63 Easter eggs in the yard and Hannah found twice as many as Helen. 

Let's use the information to set up an equation. Let H be the number of Easter eggs Helen found, and we can say that Hannah found 2H. 

Now, we can use the information given in the problem to set up an equation. We know that 63 is equal to 2H, so we can write the equation as follows:

2H = 63

To solve for H, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2. 

H = 63 รท 2
H = 31

So, Hannah found 31 Easter eggs.
