Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Morio is 71 and Teresa is 59. We know that Morio was 38 when Michiko was born. We need to find the age of Teresa when Michiko was born.

To do this, we can subtract Morio's age when Michiko was born from Morio's age when Michiko was born. This gives us the age of Teresa when Michiko was born.

Morio was 71 when Michiko was born. Morio was 38 when Michiko was born. To find the age of Teresa, we subtract Morio's age when Michiko was born from Morio's age when Michiko was born. 71 - 38 = 33.

So, Teresa was 33 years old when she gave birth to Michiko.

Answer: 33
