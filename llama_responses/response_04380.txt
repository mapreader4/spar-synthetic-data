Let's start by identifying the ratio of the number of selfies he took last year and this year.

The ratio of selfies he took last year to this year is 10:17. So, if we let x be the number of selfies he took last year, we can set up an equation to represent this ratio.

10x / (x + x + 17) = 10

We can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 10 to get:

10x / 17 = 10 / 17

x = 30

So, he took 30 selfies last year. To find the difference in the number of selfies he took this year, we can subtract 30 from the total number of selfies he has.

2430 - 30 = 2400

So, Malachi took 2400 selfies this year. The difference between this year and last year is:

2400 selfies.

Answer: 2400
