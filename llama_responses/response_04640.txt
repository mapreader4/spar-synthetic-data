Let's start by finding out how many pencils each sibling gets. The number of pencils each sibling gets is the total number of pencils divided by the number of siblings. Since there are 3 siblings, we can write the division problem as:

35 (total pencils) รท 3 (number of siblings) =?

To solve this division problem, we can divide 35 by 3, which is the same as dividing 35 by 3. 35 รท 3 = 11.666...

Since Teresa can keep 10 pencils for herself, the number of pencils each sibling gets is 35 - 10 = 25.

So, the answer is: Answer: 25.
