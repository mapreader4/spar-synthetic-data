Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of students who looked up at the airplane.

3/4 of the students looked up. 3/4 of 200 is the same as 3/4 * 200. To calculate this, we multiply 200 by 3, which gives us:

3 * 200 = 600

So, 600 students looked up at the airplane.
