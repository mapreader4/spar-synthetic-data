Let's break down the problem step by step.

Helga works 4 hours a day 5 days a week, so she works 4 * 5 = 20 hours a week.

On Thursday, she worked 2 extra hours, so we subtract those from her total hours for the week: 20 - 2 = 18 hours.

On Friday, she worked 3 extra hours, so we subtract those from her total hours for the week: 18 - 3 = 15 hours.

Helga writes 5 articles every 30 minutes, so we need to convert her total hours to minutes. 15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes. Then we divide by 30 minutes to get the number of articles she wrote: 900 รท 30 = 30.

Answer: 30
