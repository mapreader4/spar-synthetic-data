Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of days Molly rode her bike. Molly rode her bike until she turned 16, which means she rode her bike for 3 miles a day for 13 years. To find the total number of days, we can multiply the number of miles she rode per day by the number of years she rode: 3 miles per day * 13 years = 39 days.

Next, we need to multiply the total number of days by the number of miles she rode per day: 39 days * 3 miles = 117 miles.

Answer: 117
