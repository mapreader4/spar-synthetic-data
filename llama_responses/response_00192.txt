Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's first calculate the total revenue from the sale of iPhones:

100 iPhones x $1000 = $100,000

Let's calculate the total revenue from the sale of iPads:

20 iPads x $900 = $18,000

Let's calculate the total revenue from the sale of Apple TVs:

80 Apple TVs x $200 = $16,000

Now, let's add up the total revenue from all products:

$100,000 + $18,000 + $16,000 = $134,000

Now, to find the average cost across all products, we need to divide the total revenue by the total number of products sold:

Total products sold = 100 + 20 + 80 = 200

Average cost across all products = $134,000 / 200 = $670

Answer: 670
