Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Gladys will be 40 years old ten years from now, so we know that the current age of Gladys is 30 years.
* We are asked to find Juanico's age 30 years from now.

Now, let's think about the relationship between Juanico's age and Gladys' age. We know that Juanico is 4 years less than half of Gladys' age. So, we can write the equation:

Juanico's age = Gladys' age - 4

We know Gladys is 30 years old, so we can plug that into the equation:

Juanico's age = 30 - 4
Juanico's age = 26

So, 30 years from now, Juanico will be 26 years old.
