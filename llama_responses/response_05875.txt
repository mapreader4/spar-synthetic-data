Let's break this down step by step.

First, Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder.

Then, Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out. To find half of 42, we need to divide 42 by 2, which gives us 21.

Duane gave Lana 21 pages, so Lana now has the original 8 pages she had plus the 21 pages Duane gave her. To find the total number of pages Lana has, we add 8 + 21.

Answer: 29
