Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of the soda. Each bottle of soda costs half a dollar, which is equivalent to $0.50. Since Zoe has 5 family members, she will need 5 bottles of soda. The total cost of the soda is 5 x $0.50 = $2.50.

Next, let's find the cost of the pizza. Each slice of pizza costs $1, and Zoe wants to buy for her 5 family members. The total cost of the pizza is 5 x $1 = $5.

The total cost of the purchase is the sum of the cost of the soda and the cost of the pizza: $2.50 + $5 = $7.50.

Zoe takes just enough money to pay for her purchase. So, the money she takes is $7.50.
