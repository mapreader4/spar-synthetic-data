Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Mr. Eithan received a $2000 stimulus check.
2. He gave 2/5 of the amount to his wife, which is 2/5 * 2000 = $800.
3. So, the remaining amount is 2000 - 800 = $1200.
4. He gave 2/5 of the remaining amount to his first son, which is 2/5 * 1200 = $480.
5. So, the remaining amount is 1200 - 480 = $720.
6. He gave 40% of the remaining amount to his second son, which is 0.4 * 720 = $288.
7. So, the remaining amount is 720 - 288 = $432.
8. Mr. Eithan kept the remaining amount in their family savings account, which is $432.

Answer: 432
