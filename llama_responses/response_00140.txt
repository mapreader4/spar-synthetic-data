Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of kids from each school:

1. Riverside High: 20% of 120 kids = 0.20 x 120 = 24 kids
2. West Side High: 70% of 90 kids = 0.7 x 90 = 63 kids
3. Mountaintop High: half the 50 kids = 50/2 = 25 kids

Now, let's add up the number of kids from each school:

24 + 63 + 25 = 112

So, 112 kids got into the movie.

Answer: 112
