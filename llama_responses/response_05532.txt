Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one kilogram of cheese, which is $4. Then, we need to find the cost of one kilogram of vegetables, which is $2 more than the cost of cheese. So, the cost of one kilogram of vegetables is 4 + 2 = 6.

Since Emma bought 8 kg of cheese and 7 kg of vegetables, the total cost of cheese is 8 x 4 = 32. The total cost of vegetables is 7 x 6 = 42. So, the total cost is 32 + 42 = 74.

Answer: 74
