Let's break this down step by step.

Rikki can write 25 words of poetry in 5 minutes. To find out how many words he can write in 2 hours, we can multiply the number of words he can write in 5 minutes by 24 (since 2 hours is 24 times 5 minutes).

So, 25 words / 5 minutes = 5 words per minute. 5 words per minute * 24 minutes = 120 words.
