Let's break it down step by step.

Jenna buys each widget for $3 and resells it for $8, so her profit per widget is $8 - $3 = $5. Jenna sells 5000 widgets, so her total revenue is 5000 * $8 = $40,000. She has to pay $10,000 in rent, which is 20% of her total profit, so her total profit is 40000 - 10000 = $30,000. She also has to pay $2,500 to four workers, which is 2500 / 4 = $625. So her total expenses are 10000 + 2500 = $12,500. Jenna's total profit or loss is 30000 - 12500 = $17,500. Answer: 17500.
