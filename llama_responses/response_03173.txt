Let's start by thinking step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many baseball cards Phil has in total. He buys a pack of twenty each week for a year, so for 52 weeks, he buys 52 packs of 20 cards each week, which is 52 * 20 = 1040 cards. Then, he loses half of them in a fire, which is 1040 / 2 = 520 cards. So, he has 520 cards left.
