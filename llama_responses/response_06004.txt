Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of jelly beans needed for each glass.

For the large drinking glasses, it takes 50 jelly beans to fill one glass, and there are 5 of them, so it will take 50 * 5 = 250 jelly beans to fill up all the large glasses.

For the small drinking glasses, it takes half the amount, which is 50 / 2 = 25 jelly beans, and there are 3 of them, so it will take 25 * 3 = 75 jelly beans to fill up the small glasses.

To find the total number of jelly beans needed, we add the number of jelly beans for the large glasses and the small glasses: 250 + 75 = 325.

Answer: 325
