Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance of the trip.
The distance from Carl's house to the Grand Canyon is 60 miles in the city and 200 miles on the highway. The total distance is the sum of these two distances, so we can calculate it as follows:

60 + 200 = 260 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of gas needed for the trip.
Carl's car gets 30 miles per gallon in the city and 40 miles per gallon on the highway. To find the total amount of gas needed, we need to find the total distance traveled in each type of driving and then add the two together.

For the city driving, Carl will need:

60 miles / 30 miles per gallon = 2 gallons

For the highway driving, Carl will need:

200 miles / 40 miles per gallon = 5 gallons

The total amount of gas needed is the sum of these two amounts:

2 gallons + 5 gallons = 7 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the gas needed.
The cost of gas is $3.00 per gallon, so the total cost of the gas needed is:

7 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $21.00
