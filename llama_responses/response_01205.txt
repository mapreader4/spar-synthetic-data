Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that half of the 20 skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children.

Let's call the number of adult women 10, since half of 20 is 10. So, 10 adult women are in the graveyard.

We are also given that an adult woman has 20 bones in their body. Let's call this number x. We are told that a male has 5 more bones than an adult woman, so the male has x + 5 bones.

We are also given that a child has half as many bones as an adult woman. So, the child has x / 2 bones.

Now, we can write an equation to solve for x. We know that x = 20, since an adult woman has x bones, and a male has x + 5 bones. We also know that a child has x / 2 bones.

We can write the equation as follows:

x = 20 - 5 = 15

So, the child has 15 bones.

Now, we know that the adult women have 10 bones, and the adult men and children have 15 bones. So, the total number of bones in the graveyard is 10 + 15 = 25.

Answer: 25
