Let's break this down step by step.

GiGi cut each mushroom into 4 pieces, so for each mushroom, she got 4 pieces.

Kenny took 38 mushroom pieces and Karla took 42 mushroom pieces.

There were 8 pieces of mushrooms remaining on the cutting board.

To find the total number of mushroom pieces, we add up the pieces taken by Kenny and Karla, and the remaining pieces: 38 + 42 + 8 = 88

Since each mushroom gives us 4 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4 to find the number of mushrooms: 88 รท 4 = 22

So, GiGi cut up 22 mushrooms at the beginning.

Answer: 22
