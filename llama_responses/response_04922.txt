Let's break it down step by step.

First, James sells the house for 20% over market value, which means the house is sold for 1.2 times the market value. Let's call the market value x. Then, the revenue is 1.2x.

Next, James splits the revenue with his 3 brothers. So, each brother gets 1/3 of the revenue, which is 1/3 * 1.2x = 0.4x.

After that, James takes away 10% of the revenue, so each brother gets 0.9x.

To find the amount each brother gets, we can multiply the remaining 0.9x by 100, which is the percentage 0.9. So, each brother gets 0.9x * 100 = 90.

Answer: 90
