Let's break down the problem step by step:

Zach has already saved $65.  He needs $100 to buy the bike.  He needs $100 - $65 = $35 more.  He will earn $10 from his allowance on Friday.  He will earn $7 for 2 hours of babysitting on Saturday.  $10 + $7 = $17.  So, in total, he will earn $27.  He needs $35 - $27 = $8 more to buy the bike.

Answer: 8
