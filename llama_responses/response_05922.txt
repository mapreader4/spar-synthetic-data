Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of papers she can grade in 8 hours. To do this, we can divide 296 papers by 8 hours. 

296 รท 8 = 37

So, she can grade 37 papers in 8 hours.

Now, let's find the number of papers she can grade in 11 hours. 

11 hours is 11/2 of 22 hours. So, we can multiply 37 by 2 to get the number of papers she can grade in 11 hours.

37 * 2 = 74

So, Ms. Alice can grade 74 papers in 11 hours. 

Answer: 74
