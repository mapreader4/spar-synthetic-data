Let's break this down step by step:

Let's say the number of gallons of gas Adhira used for her trip is x.

We know that Felicity used 5 less gallons of gas than four times the number of gallons that Adhira used, so we can set up an equation:

Felicity's gas used = Adhira's gas used - 5

Since Felicity and Adhira used 30 gallons of gas together, we know that the sum of their gas usage is 30. So, we can set up another equation:

Adhira's gas used + Felicity's gas used = 30

We can solve for Adhira's gas used by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

Adhira's gas used = 30 - 5

Adhira's gas used = 25

Now we know that Adhira used 25 gallons of gas. We can use this information to find Felicity's gas used by subtracting 25 from the total gas used:

Felicity's gas used = 30 - 25

Felicity's gas used = 5

Answer: 5
