Let's break this problem down step by step.

Marcus's car had 1728 miles on it initially. He filled his empty gas tank twice. So, the amount of gas he used is 2 x 20 = 40 gallons.

Marcus's car gets 30 miles per gallon, so the total distance he can travel with the 40 gallons of gas is 30 x 40 = 1200 miles.

Now, let's subtract the initial 1728 miles from the total distance he can travel with the 40 gallons of gas. This gives us the remaining miles:

1728 - 1200 = 528

Answer: 528
