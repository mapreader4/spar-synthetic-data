Let's start by calculating the total cost of each type of item:

* Graphics cards: 10 units x $600 per unit = $6000
* Hard drives: 14 units x $80 per unit = $1120
* CPUs: 8 units x $200 per unit = $1600
* RAM: 4 units x $60 per unit = $240

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

$6000 + $1120 + $1600 + $240 = $7160

The store earned a total of $7160 this week.
