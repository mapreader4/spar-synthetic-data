Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the current plan. Darnell sends 60 texts and spends 60 minutes on the phone each month, which is a total of 120 minutes. At $12 per month, the total cost is 12 x 120 = 1440 cents, or $14.40.

The alternative plan charges $1 per 30 texts and $3 per 20 minutes of calls. Darnell sends 60 texts and spends 60 minutes on the phone each month. 

60 texts is 2 groups of 30 texts, which would cost 2 x 1 = 2 dollars. 60 minutes is 3 groups of 20 minutes, which would cost 3 x 3 = 9 dollars. So, the total cost of the alternative plan is 2 + 9 = 11 dollars.

The difference between the two plans is 14.40 - 11 = 3.4 dollars. Darnell would pay 3.4 dollars less on the alternative plan.
