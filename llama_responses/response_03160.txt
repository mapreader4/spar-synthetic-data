Let's break it down step by step.

James had two browsers, so that's 2 browsers.

In each browser, he opened 3 tabs. So, in the first browser, there are 3 tabs. In the second browser, there are also 3 tabs. So, the total number of tabs in the 2 browsers is 2 * 3 = 6.

So, the total number of tabs James opened is 6 + 3 = 9.
