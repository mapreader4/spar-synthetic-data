Let's think step by step.

Addie has 18 stamps initially.
Addie puts one fourth of her 72 stamps in Parker’s scrapbook. To find one fourth of 72, we need to divide 72 by 4. 72 divided by 4 is 18. So, one fourth of 72 is 18.

So, Addie puts 18 stamps in Parker’s scrapbook. Now, Addie has 18 - 18 = 0 stamps left.
