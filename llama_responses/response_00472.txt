Let's break it down step by step.

Lydia is currently 9 years old, and she planted the apple tree when she was 4 years old. So, the apple tree took 7 years to bear fruit. To find when she will eat an apple for the first time, we need to add 7 years to her current age:

9 (current age) + 7 (time for apple tree to bear fruit) = 16

Answer: 16
