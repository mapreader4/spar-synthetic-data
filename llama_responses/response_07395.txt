Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Matt has ten times as many jellybeans as Steve, and Steve has 84 jellybeans. So, Matt has 10 x 84 = 840 jellybeans.

Next, we know that Matilda has half as many jellybeans as Matt. So, if Matt has 840 jellybeans, Matilda has 840/2 = 420 jellybeans.

Answer: 420
