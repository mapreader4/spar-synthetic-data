Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of snakes we know: there are 200 snakes in total, and there are 3 times as many pythons as boa constrictors.

We know that there are 40 boa constrictors, so we can set up an equation to represent the number of pythons:

Let x be the number of pythons. Then, we can set up the equation: 3x = 40

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 40 / 3
x = 13.33

So, there are 13 pythons.

Now, we know the total number of snakes is 200, and we know the number of boa constrictors and pythons. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of snakes:

200 = 40 (boa constrictors) + x (pythons) + rattlesnakes

We know the number of boa constrictors is 40, and we just calculated the number of pythons is 13. We can substitute these values into the equation:

200 = 40 + 13 + rattlesnakes

To solve for rattlesnakes, we can subtract 40 and 13 from both sides of the equation:

200 - 40 - 13 = rattlesnakes
150 = rattlesnakes

So, the answer is:

Answer: 150
