Let's break this down step by step:

* Ginger has 2 children, and she makes a cake for each of them on their birthdays, Christmas, Easter, and Halloween. So, for each of her children, she makes 4 cakes per year. Since she has 2 children, that's a total of 8 cakes per year.
* She also makes a cake for her husband on the same holidays, as well as on their anniversary and Valentine's Day. That's a total of 6 cakes per year.
* She makes cakes for both her parents on their birthdays, which is 2 cakes per year.

In a year, Ginger makes a total of 8 + 6 + 2 = 16 cakes.

Since she does this for 10 years, we multiply the total number of cakes per year by 10:

16 cakes/year Ã— 10 years = 160 cakes

Answer: 160
