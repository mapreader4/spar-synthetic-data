Let's start by using the information that Karen's tote is twice the weight of Kevin's briefcase when it is empty. So, the weight of Kevin's briefcase is half the weight of Karen's tote. When the briefcase is full, it is twice the weight of Karen's tote. So, the weight of the laptop and papers in the briefcase is the difference between the weight of the full briefcase and the weight of the empty briefcase. This is equal to the weight of the full briefcase minus the weight of the empty briefcase, which is the weight of the laptop and papers. Since the laptop and papers are a sixth of the weight of the full briefcase, the weight of the laptop is 1/6 of the weight of the full briefcase. 

Now, let's find the weight of the laptop. We know that the laptop is 1/6 of the weight of the full briefcase, and the full briefcase is twice the weight of Karen's tote. So, the laptop is 1/6 of 2 times the weight of Karen's tote. 1/6 of 2 times 8 is 4. So, the laptop weighs 4 pounds. 

To find the difference in weight between the laptop and Karen's tote, we need to subtract the weight of Karen's tote from the weight of the laptop. 8 - 4 is 4. So, the laptop weighs 4 pounds more than Karen's tote.
