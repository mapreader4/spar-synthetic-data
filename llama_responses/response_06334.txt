Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the given information: Jaydee can type 38 words in a minute.

To find the number of minutes it would take to type the research paper, we need to divide the total number of words by the number of words he can type per minute.

The total number of words is 4560.

Number of words per minute = 38

To find the number of minutes, we divide the total number of words by the number of words per minute:

4560 words รท 38 words per minute = 120 minutes

So, Jaydee will take 120 minutes to finish typing the research paper.
