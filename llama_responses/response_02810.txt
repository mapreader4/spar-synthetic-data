Let's think about this step by step.

Let's say there are x red crayons. Since there are 4 times as many red crayons as blue crayons, then we know that x = 3. This is because the number of red crayons is equal to the number of blue crayons.

So, the number of crayons in the box is 3 + 3, which is 6.

Answer: 6
