Let's start by identifying the number of carpets in each house:

House 1 has 12 carpets.
House 2 has 20 carpets.
House 3 has 10 carpets.
House 4 has twice as many carpets as House 3, so House 4 has 2 * 10 = 20 carpets.

Now, let's add up the number of carpets in all 4 houses:

12 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 52

Answer: 52
