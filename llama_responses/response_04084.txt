Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of flowers Rose bought.

Rose bought a dozen flowers, which is equal to 12.

Two of the flowers are daisies.

We can subtract 2 from the total number of flowers to find the remaining flowers.

12 - 2 = 10

Three-fifths of the remaining flowers are tulips.

We can find the number of tulips by multiplying 3/5 * 10.

3/5 * 10 = 6

The remaining flowers are sunflowers.

We can subtract the number of tulips from the total remaining flowers to find the number of sunflowers.

10 - 6 = 4

So, the number of sunflowers is 4.

Answer: 4
