Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of the first 100 channels, which is $100.

The cost of the next 100 channels is half of that, so it's $50.

Since James splits it evenly with his roommate, that means he pays half of $50, which is $25.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first 100 channels and the cost of the next 100 channels, which is $100 + $50, or $150.

James pays this amount to the cable company, so his total payment is $150.

Answer: 150
