Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that there are 5 intersections.
2. Each intersection has 20 lines.
3. The total number of lines is the product of the number of intersections and the number of lines per intersection. So, we multiply 5 (the number of intersections) by 20 (the number of lines per intersection):

5 * 20 = 100

Answer: 100
