Let's break it down step by step.

First, the price of one tub of ice cream is $12, but it's on sale for $2 less. So, the new price is $12 - $2 = $10.

Next, the price of juice is $2 per 5 cans, so for 10 cans, it will cost 10 x $2 = $20.

Now, let's add the cost of the ice cream and the juice together. The total cost will be $10 for the ice cream and $20 for the juice, which is $10 + $20 = $30.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 30
