Let's break this problem down step by step.

Sienna gave Bailey half of her suckers. Let's call the number of suckers Sienna has initially as x. So, Bailey got x/2 suckers.

Jen ate half of what Bailey got, so Jen ate (x/2)/2 = x/4 suckers.

Molly got the rest, which is x - x/2 - x/4 = x/4 suckers.

Molly ate 2 and gave the rest to Harmony. Harmony got x/4 - 2 suckers.

Harmony kept 3 and passed the remainder to Taylor. Taylor got x/4 - 2 - 3 = x/4 - 5 suckers.

Taylor ate one and gave the last 5 to Callie. So, Callie got x/4 - 5 - 1 = x/4 - 6 suckers.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent Jen's suckers eaten:

x/4 = number of suckers Jen ate

We know that x is the total number of suckers Sienna had initially, and Jen ate half of Bailey's suckers, which is x/2, and then half of that, which is x/4.
