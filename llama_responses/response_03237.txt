Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many pancakes each person will have. If Luther has 8 people in his family, and he already made 12 pancakes, and he wants to give each person a second pancake, then he will need to make pancakes for each of the 8 people. So, he needs to make pancakes for 8 people.

To find out how many pancakes he needs to make, we can multiply the number of people by 2. 8 * 2 = 16.

So, Luther needs to make 16 more pancakes.
