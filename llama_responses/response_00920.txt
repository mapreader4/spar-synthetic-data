Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of 10 drinks. The cost of a drink is $2, so the total cost of 10 drinks would be 10 x 2 = $20.

Next, we need to find the cost of 5 cakes. The cost of a cake is $10, so the total cost of 5 cakes would be 5 x 10 = $50.

Finally, we need to find the cost of 100 ice creams. The cost of an ice cream is $5, so the total cost of 100 ice creams would be 100 x 5 = $500.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the drinks, cakes, and ice creams: $20 + $50 + $500 = $570.

Answer: 570
