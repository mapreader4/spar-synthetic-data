Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of hens. We know that there are 12 hens.

Next, we know that for every 3 hens, there is 1 rooster. This means that the number of roosters is equal to the number of hens divided by 3.

To find the number of roosters, we can divide the number of hens by 3: 12 รท 3 = 4.

Now, we know that each hen has 5 chicks. So, the total number of chicks is equal to the number of hens multiplied by 5: 12 * 5 = 60.

So, the total number of chickens is equal to the number of hens plus the number of roosters plus the number of chicks. This is 12 + 4 + 60 = 76.

Answer: 76
