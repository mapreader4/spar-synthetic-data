Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Kenneth's total earnings are x. Then, he spent 10% of his earnings on a new joystick. 10% of x is equal to 0.1x.

The equation to solve for x is 0.1x = 10%. To isolate x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.1 to get x = 100.

So, x = 100. This means that Kenneth's total earnings are 100. He is left with 405, which is his earnings after spending 10% on a new joystick.
