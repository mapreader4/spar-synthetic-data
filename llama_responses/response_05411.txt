Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the time taken by the car to reach station B.

The car takes 4.5 hours to reach station B, so the time taken by the car is 4.5 hours.

Step 2: Let's find the time taken by the train to reach station B.

The train takes 2 hours longer than the car, so the time taken by the train is 2 hours.

Step 3: Let's find the combined time taken by the car and the train to reach station B.

The combined time taken by the car and the train is the time taken by the car (4.5 hours) + the time taken by the train (2 hours) = 6.5 hours.

Answer: 6.5
