Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find out how many packets of sugar substitute Christopher will need for 90 days.

Christopher uses 2 packets a day, so for 90 days, he will need:

2 packets/day * 90 days = 180 packets

Step 2: Find the cost of 180 packets of sugar substitute.

Each box contains 30 packets, so to find the cost of 180 packets, we need to divide 180 by 30:

180 packets / 30 packets per box = 6 boxes

The cost of 1 box is $4.00, so the cost of 6 boxes is:

6 boxes * $4.00 = $24.00

So, the cost for Christopher to have enough sugar substitutes to last him 90 days is $24.00.
