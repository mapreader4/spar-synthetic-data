Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many pounds Ajax will lose in one hour of exercise. Since he loses 1.5 pounds in one hour, and 1 kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds, we can set up a proportion to find the pounds lost in one hour:

1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds

We can set up a proportion to solve for the pounds lost in one hour:

1 kg / 2.2 pounds = x pounds/hour

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 1 kg * 2.2 pounds / 1

x = 2.2 pounds

So, Ajax loses 2.2 pounds in one hour.

2. Now, we need to find out how many pounds Ajax will lose in two hours of exercise. Since he exercises for 2 hours, we can multiply the pounds lost in one hour by 2:

2 hours * 2.2 pounds/hour =?

2 * 2.2 = 4.4 pounds

3. Next, we need to find out how many pounds Ajax will lose in two weeks. Since he exercises for 2 hours every day, and there are 14 days in two weeks, we can multiply the pounds lost in two hours by 14:

4.4 pounds * 14 =?

4.4 * 14 = 61.6 pounds

Answer: 61
