Let's break this down step by step.

Hallie read 63 pages on the first day.

On the second day, she read twice the number of pages she read on day one, which is 2 x 63 = 126 pages.

On the third day, she read 10 more pages than she read on day two, which is 126 + 10 = 136 pages.

So, the total number of pages she read in the first three days is:

63 + 126 + 136 = 325 pages

Since the book is 354 pages long, the number of pages she read on the fourth day is:

354 - 325 = 29 pages

Answer: 29
