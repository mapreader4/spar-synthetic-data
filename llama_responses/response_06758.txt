Let's break this down step by step.

1. Since Eric removed wallpaper from 1 wall in the dining room, it took him 2 hours.  So, the time it took him to remove wallpaper from 1 wall is 2 hours.
2. Since he has 4 walls in his dining room, it will take him 2 * 4 = 8 hours to remove wallpaper from all the walls in the dining room.
3. Since he has 4 walls in his living room, it will take him 2 * 4 = 8 hours to remove wallpaper from all the walls in the living room.
4. Since he needs to remove wallpaper from the remaining 8 walls, it will take him 8 + 8 = 16 hours in total.
