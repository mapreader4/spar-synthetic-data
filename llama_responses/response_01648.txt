Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many jumping jacks Kenny did last week. He did 324 jumping jacks last week. This is the total number of jumping jacks he did.

Now, let's find out how many jumping jacks he did this week. We have the following information:

* Sunday: 34
* Monday: skipped (he skipped a day)
* Tuesday: 20
* Wednesday: 123
* Thursday: 64
* Friday: 23

We can add up the number of jumping jacks he did each day:

34 + 20 + 123 + 64 + 23 = 261

So, this week, Kenny has done 261 jumping jacks.

To make sure he beats last week's number, he needs to do more than 324 - 261 = 63.

Answer: 63
