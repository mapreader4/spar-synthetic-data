Let's break down the problem step by step.

The teacher had a remaining budget of $6 from last year and was given a $50 budget for this year. So, the total amount of money she had is $6 + $50 = $56.

The teacher purchased school supplies that cost $13 and $24. To find out how much money remains in her budget after purchasing the school supplies, we need to subtract the cost of the supplies from the total amount of money she had.

$56 (total budget) - $13 (cost of supplies) = $43

$56 (total budget) - $24 (cost of supplies) = $32

So, the teacher has $32 left in her budget after purchasing the school supplies.

Answer: 32
