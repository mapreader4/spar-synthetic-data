Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the depth of the river in mid-May is x feet.

Since the river is 10 feet deeper in mid-June than in mid-May, we know that the depth in mid-June is x + 10 feet.

We know that the river is three times deeper in mid-July than in mid-June, so the depth in mid-July is (x + 10) Ã— 3 = 3x + 30 feet.

We are given that the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 5

So, the river was 5 feet deep in mid-May.
