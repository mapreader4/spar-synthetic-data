Let's break down the problem step by step.

Derek puts $2 away in January, so he has $2 left.
In February, he puts $4 away, so he has $6 left.
In March, he puts $8 away, so he has $14 left.
In April, he puts $16 away, so he has $30 left.
In May, he follows this pattern, so he will put $32 away, leaving him with $2.
In June, he will put $40 away, leaving him with $42.
In July, he will put $48 away, leaving him with $26.
In August, he will put $56 away, leaving him with $22.
In September, he will put $64 away, leaving him with $14.
In October, he will put $72 away, leaving him with $14.
In November, he will put $80 away, leaving him with $6.
In December, he will put $96 away, leaving him with $10.

Derek started with $100, and after putting $2, $4, $8, $16, $32, $40, $48, $56, $64, $72, and $80 away, he will have $10 left.
