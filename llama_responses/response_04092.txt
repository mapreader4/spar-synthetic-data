Let's break down the number of pages she needs to read for each class:

* English: 20 pages
* Science: 16 pages
* Civics: 8 pages
* Chinese: 12 pages

She decided to read one-fourth of the number of pages for each class, so we multiply each class's number of pages by 1/4:

* English: 20 * 1/4 = 5
* Science: 16 * 1/4 = 4
* Civics: 8 * 1/4 = 2
* Chinese: 12 * 1/4 = 3

So, Melody will read 5 pages for English, 4 pages for Science, 2 pages for Civics, and 3 pages for Chinese. In total, she will read 5 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 14 pages.
