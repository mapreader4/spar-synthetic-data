Let's start by letting x be the original price of the iPhone cases.

Let's say x is the original price. The question states that if you buy more than 15 units, the price will be 20% lower than the original price. So, if you pay 500 dollars for 18 units, then the 20% discount will be 400 dollars. To find the original price, we can set up an equation.

We know that the 20% discount is 20% of the original price. So, let's say that the 20% discount is equal to 0.20x. We know that the 20% discount is 20% of the original price, so 0.20x = 20% of x. So, we can solve for x.

0.20x = 20% of x, so 0.20x = 0.2x. We know that the 20% discount is 20% of the original price, so 0.2x = 0.2x. We know that 0.2x = 500 - 400, since 20% of 500 is 100. So, 0.2x = 100. So, we can solve for x.

x = 500 / 0.2 = 100. x = 2500.

Answer: 2500
