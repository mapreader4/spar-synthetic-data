Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. Betty has 20 books. Her sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty. 1/4 of 20 is 5, so her sister has 20 + 5 = 25 books.

Now, to find the total number of books the two have, we add the number of books Betty has to the number of books her sister has: 20 + 25 = 45.

Answer: 45
