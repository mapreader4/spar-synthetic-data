Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the given information that the difference in the scores between Hajar and Farah's score is 21. This means that Farah's score is 21 more than Hajar's score.

Let's call Hajar's score x. Then, we can say that Farah's score is x + 21.

We know that the sum of their scores is the sum of Hajar's score and Farah's score, which is x + (x + 21).

We know that Hajar's score is 24, so we can set up the equation as follows:

x + (x + 21) = 24 + x

To solve for x, we can subtract 21 from both sides of the equation to get:

x + 21 = 24 - 21
x = 3

Now we know that Hajar's score is 3.

We can now find the sum of their scores by adding Hajar's score and Farah's score. Since Farah's score is x + 21, and Hajar's score is 3, we can substitute x with 3 in the equation:

3 + (3 + 21) =?

3 + 24 = 27

Answer: 27
