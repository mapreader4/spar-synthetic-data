Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

10 paintings at $40 each = 10 x 40 = $400
8 wooden toys at $20 each = 8 x 20 = $160
Total cost = $400 + $160 = $560

Mr. Callen wants to sell the items at a profit. So, he will add a profit to the total cost. Let's calculate the selling price of the paintings:

Selling price of a painting = $40 + (10% of $40) = $40 + $4 = $44
Selling price of a toy = $20 + (15% of $20) = $20 + $3 = $23

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of the items:

10 paintings at $44 each = 10 x 44 = $440
8 wooden toys at $23 each = 8 x 23 = $184
Total selling price = $440 + $184 = $624

Now, let's calculate the total loss:

Total selling price = $624
Total cost = $560
Loss = Total selling price - Total cost = $624 - $560 = $64

Answer: 64
