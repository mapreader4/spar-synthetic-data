Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The supermarket has 2355 loaves of bread at the start of the day.
2. 629 loaves are sold in the afternoon, which means the number of loaves left is 2355 - 629 = 1726.
3. 489 loaves are delivered to the supermarket in the evening, which means the total number of loaves is 1726 + 489 = 2215.
4. Therefore, at the end of the day, there are 2215 loaves of bread.

Answer: 2215
