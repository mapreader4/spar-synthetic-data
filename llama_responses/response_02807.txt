Let's start by calculating the total time it took Osborn to get dressed on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday:

Monday: 2 minutes
Tuesday: 4 minutes
Wednesday: 3 minutes
Thursday: 4 minutes

Total time: 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13 minutes

To find the average time it took Osborn to get dressed on these days, we can divide the total time by the number of days:

Average time: 13 minutes / 4 days = 3.25 minutes per day

Since Osborn wants his weekly average to tie his old method of 3 minutes per day, he needs to get dressed in a time that will bring his weekly average back down to 3 minutes.

To do this, he needs to add the time it took him to get dressed on Friday to the total time, and then divide by 5 (the number of days in a week) to find the new average:

New total time = 13 minutes + Friday's time
New average = (New total time) / 5

We know that Osborn's old method had an average time of 3 minutes per day, so we can set up an equation:

New average = 3

Substituting the expression for the new average, we get:

(13 + Friday's time) / 5 = 3

To solve for Friday's time, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

13 + Friday's time = 15

Subtracting 13 from both sides gives us:

Friday's time = 2
