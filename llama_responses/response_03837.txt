Let's break this down step by step.

The first dog carried off 3 bones.

The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog, so it carried off 3 - 1 = 2 bones.

The third dog carried off twice as many bones as the second dog, so it carried off 2 x 2 = 4 bones.

The fourth dog carried off 1 bone.

The fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog, so it carried off 1 x 2 = 2 bones.

To find the total number of bones carried off, we add up the number of bones each dog carried off:

3 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 12

So, the dogs carried off a total of 12 bones. Since there were no bones left in the dumpster, the original pile of bones must have had 12 bones.

Answer: 12
