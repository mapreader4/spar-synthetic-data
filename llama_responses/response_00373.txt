Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the cost of the small tubs is x. Since there are 6 small tubs and the total cost of all the tubs is $48, we can set up an equation:

3 * 6 + x = 48

We can solve for x by subtracting 3 * 6 from both sides of the equation:

3 * 6 = 48 - 3 * 6 = x

6 = x

So the cost of the small tubs is 6.
