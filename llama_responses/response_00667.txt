Let's break this down step by step:

1. There are 15 dogs in total.
2. Half of the dogs have spots. Half of 15 is 7.5, but we can round this down to 7, since we can't have a fraction of a dog.
3. 1/5 of the dogs have pointy ears. 1/5 of 15 is 3, since 15/5 = 3.
4. So, 7 dogs have spots and 3 dogs have pointy ears.

Answer: 3
