Let's break this problem down step by step.

Joey wants to know how much the High Jump sneakers cost. He wants to know if his earnings from mowing lawns, selling collectible figures, and working an after-school job cover the cost of the shoes.

Let's first find out how much Joey earns from mowing lawns. He mows 3 lawns for $8 each, so he earns a total of:

3 x $8 = $24

Next, let's find out how much Joey earns from selling collectible figures. He sells 2 figures for $9 each, so he earns a total of:

2 x $9 = $18

Now, let's find out how much Joey earns from his after-school job. He works for 10 hours at $5 per hour, so he earns a total of:

10 x $5 = $50

Now, let's add up all of Joey's earnings:

$24 + $18 + $50 = $92

Joey's total earnings are $92. Since his earnings cover the cost of the High Jump sneakers, the price of the shoes must be:

Answer: $92
