Kara mixes cups of sugar and water in the ratio of 1:2 to make one liter of lemonade. So, we can set up a proportion to solve the problem. Let's say 1 cup of sugar is equal to x. Then, 2 cups of water is equal to 2x. We can set up a proportion: 1x + 2x = 1L. We know that 1L is equal to 1000 milliliters, so 1x + 2x = 1000. We can solve for x by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation: 1x = 1000 - 1 = 999. So, x is equal to 999. Now, we know that 999 is equal to 99.99. But we need to find out how many cups of sugar were used. We know that 1 cup is equal to 16.9 milliliters. So, 99.99 is equal to 166.89 milliliters. Since 166.89 is equal to 10.432 cups, we know that 10.432 cups is equal to 10.432 * 16.9 = 177.528 cups. So, the total number of cups of sugar used is 177.528 cups. 

Answer: 177.528
