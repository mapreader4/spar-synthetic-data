Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Olaf scored x points. Then, his dad scored 7 points.

Olaf's score is x + 7 points.

The total number of points is x + 7.

Since Olaf scored three times more points than his dad, that means that x is 3 times 7, or 3 * 7.

x = 3 * 7 = 21.

So, Olaf scored 21 points and his dad scored 7 points.

The total number of points they scored is 21 + 7 = 28.

Answer: 28
