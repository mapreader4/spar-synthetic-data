Let's break it down step by step.

The bulk warehouse is offering 48 cans of sparkling water for $12.00, so the price per can is $12.00 / 48 = $0.25 per can.

The grocery store is offering the same sparkling water for $6.00 for 12 cans, so the price per can is $6.00 / 12 = $0.50 per can.

To find the difference in price per can, we need to subtract the price per can at the grocery store from the price per can at the bulk warehouse. $0.50 - $0.25 = $0.25.
