Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Aku's mom bought 3 packages of cookies, each containing 25 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 3 x 25 = 75 cookies.

Step 2: The 4 friends are going to eat the cookies equally. To find the number of cookies each child will eat, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of friends.

Step 3: 75 cookies divided by 4 friends = 75 / 4 = 18.75.
