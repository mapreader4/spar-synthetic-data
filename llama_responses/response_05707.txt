Let's break down the problem step by step.

Max has 20 red stamps and sold them for $1.1 each, so the total amount earned from red stamps is:

20 x $1.1 = $22

Max has 80 blue stamps and sold them for $0.8 each, so the total amount earned from blue stamps is:

80 x $0.8 = $64

The total amount earned from selling red and blue stamps is:

$22 + $64 = $86

Since Max wants to earn a total of $100, he needs to earn an additional:

$100 - $86 = $14

from the sale of yellow stamps.

Max has 7 yellow stamps, so the price he needs to set for each yellow stamp to earn the additional $14 is:

$14 / 7 = $2

So, Max needs to set the price of each yellow stamp at $2 to earn a total of $100 from the whole sale.
