Let's break this down step by step:

1. Josie waited 3 minutes for a cart.
2. Then, she waited 13 minutes for an employee to unlock a cabinet.
3. Next, she waited 14 minutes for a stocker to restock a shelf.
4. After that, she waited 18 minutes in line to check out.

To find the total time Josie spent waiting, we can add up the time spent waiting at each step:

3 + 13 + 14 + 18 = 44

So, Josie spent 44 minutes waiting.
