Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cost of the vegetables is 6 pounds * $2 per pound = 6 * 2 = $12.
2. The cost of the beef is 4 pounds * 3 times the price of the vegetables, which is 4 * 3 * 2 = 12.
3. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the vegetables and the cost of the beef: 12 + 12 = 24.

Answer: 24
