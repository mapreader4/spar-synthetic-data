Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of students under 11 years. Since a third of the class is under 11 years, we can set up an equation: 1/3 × 45 = x. This means that x = 15. This means that 15 students are under 11 years.

Next, we know that two-fifths of the class are above 11 but under 13. We can set up another equation: 2/5 × 45 = x. This means that x = 18. This means that 18 students are above 11 years.

Now, to find the number of students in the third group, we subtract the number of students under 11 from the total number of students: 45 - 15 - 18 = 12.

Answer: 12
