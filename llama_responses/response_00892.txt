Let's start by identifying the discount. Clark paid 7 parts for $439. The question asks how much the discount is. To find the discount, we need to subtract the cost of the 7 parts from the original price of the 7 parts. The original price of the 7 parts is $80. So, the cost of the 7 parts is $80. We subtract $439 from that to get the discount.

Answer: $39.
