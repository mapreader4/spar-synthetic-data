Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that the rent is $1100. The utilities are $114, so the total amount of money left for groceries is 1100 - 114 = 986. Then, we know that one roommate pays 757, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of money left for groceries. 986 - 757 = 229. So, the amount of money for groceries is 229.
