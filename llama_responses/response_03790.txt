Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of honey that James has. He has 5 hives that each produce 20 liters of honey. So, the total amount of honey he has is 5 x 20 = 100 liters.

Since each jar can hold 0.5 liters, we can divide the total amount of honey by the capacity of each jar to find how many jars he needs. 100 liters / 0.5 liters per jar = 200 jars.

Since his friend is bringing his own jars for half the honey, James will need half of the jars. So, he will need 200 / 2 = 100 jars.
