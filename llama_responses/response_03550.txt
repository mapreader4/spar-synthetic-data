Let's break it down step by step.

Porter earns $8 per day, and he works 5 days a week. So, his weekly income is:

$8 * 5 = $40

His manager is offering him an extra 50% on top of his daily rate, so that is an extra 50% of $8, which is:

$8 * 0.5 = $4

So, the extra amount he will earn is $4 per day. Since he works 5 days a week, he will earn the extra amount for 5 days:

$4 * 5 = $20

Adding the extra amount to his regular weekly income, his total income for the week will be:

$40 + $20 = $60

Now, we need to find out how much he will earn in a month. Since he works 4 weeks in a month (assuming a 4-week month), we multiply his weekly income by 4:

$60 * 4 = $240

So, Porter will earn $240 in a month if he works overtime every week.
