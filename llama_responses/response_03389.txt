Let's break it down step by step:

1. The price of RAM increased by 30% due to the fire. So, the new price is 130% of the original price. So, the new price is 1.3 times the original price.

2. After two years, the price stabilized and then fell by 20%. This means that the new price is 80% of the stabilized price.

3. So, the stabilized price is 0.8 times the new price. To find the original price, we need to divide the stabilized price by 1.25 (which is 1.3 / 0.8).

4. So, the original price is 50 / 1.25 = 40.

Answer: 40
