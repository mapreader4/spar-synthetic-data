Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. When the temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit, Peyton throws the ball 20 yards.
2. When the temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit, he throws the ball twice as far, which is 2 * 20 = 40 yards.
3. On Saturday, he throws the ball 20 times.
4. On Sunday, the temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and he throws the ball 30 times.
5. To find the total number of yards he threw the ball in the two days, we add the yards he threw on Saturday and Sunday: 20 + 30 = 50 yards.

Answer: 50
