Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of each size portrait:

* An 8-inch portrait is sold for $5.
* A 16-inch portrait is sold for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait, so it is sold for 5 x 2 = $10.

Now, let's find the total amount earned per day:

* 3 x 8-inch portraits are sold for 3 x $5 = $15.
* 5 x 16-inch portraits are sold for 5 x $10 = $50.
* Total amount earned per day = $15 + $50 = $65.

Now, let's find the total amount earned in 3 days:

* $65 x 3 = $195.

So, Sansa earns $195 every 3 days.
