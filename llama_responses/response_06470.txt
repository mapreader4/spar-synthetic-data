Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Greg drives 30 miles to the farmer's market.
2. At the farmer's market, he buys his groceries.
3. Then, he drives for 30 minutes at 20 miles per hour to get home.

To find the total distance Greg travels, we need to add the distance he drives to the farmer's market and the distance he drives to get home.

The distance to the farmer's market is 30 miles. The distance he drives to get home is 30 miles.

30 + 30 = 60

Answer: 60
