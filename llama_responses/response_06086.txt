Let's solve the problem step by step.

John buys 20 candy bars.  His brother Dave pays for 6 of them.  We need to find the cost of 6 candy bars.

The cost of each candy bar is $1.50.  So, the cost of 6 candy bars would be:

1.50 * 6 = 9.00

John's brother Dave pays 9 dollars for 6 candy bars.
