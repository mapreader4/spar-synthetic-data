Let's start by identifying the number of each color of marble in each basket:

* Basket A: 4 red marbles and 2 yellow marbles
* Basket B: 6 green marbles and 1 yellow marble
* Basket C: 0 white marbles and 9 yellow marbles

The greatest difference is between the number of each color of marble in Basket C, which has 9 yellow marbles and 0 white marbles. The difference is 9 - 0 = 9.

Answer: 9
