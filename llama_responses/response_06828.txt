Let's start by finding the cost of the pencils. There are 38 pencils, and each pencil costs $2.50. So, the cost of the pencils is:

38 x $2.50 = $94

Now, let's find the cost of the pens. There are 56 pens, and each pen costs $3.50. So, the cost of the pens is:

56 x $3.50 = $196

To find the total cost of both, we add the cost of the pencils and the cost of the pens:

$94 + $196 = $290

So, the total cost is $290.
