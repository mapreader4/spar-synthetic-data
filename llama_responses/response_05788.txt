Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* The friends went for 3.5 hours, which is equivalent to 210 minutes.
* They traveled 21 kilometers in that time.
* Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time.

Let's find the average time taken by the friends:

Let's use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. We know the distance (21 km) and the total time (210 minutes), so we can find the speed:

Speed = Distance / Time = 21 km / 210 min = 0.1 km/min

Now, we know the speed of the friends. We also know that Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. So, we can find Birgit's speed:

Birgit's speed = Average speed + 4 minutes/km = 0.1 km/min + 4 min/km = 0.1 km/min + 0.06667 km/min = 0.16667 km/min

Now, we can find the time it would take Birgit to go 8 kilometers:

Time = Distance / Speed = 8 km / 0.16667 km/min = 48.1 min

So, it would take Birgit approximately 48.1 minutes to go 8 kilometers if she kept the same pace.
