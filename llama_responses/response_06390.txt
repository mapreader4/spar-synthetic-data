Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total amount of water needed for drinking and bathing per day for the 3 horses Ivar currently has.

For drinking: 3 horses x 5 liters per day = 15 liters per day
For bathing: 3 horses x 2 liters per day = 6 liters per day
Total daily water needed: 15 liters (drinking) + 6 liters (bathing) = 21 liters per day

Now, if Ivar adds 5 more horses, the total number of horses will be 3 + 5 = 8.

For the 28 days, the total amount of water needed will be:

8 horses x 15 liters (drinking) = 120 liters
8 horses x 6 liters (bathing) = 48 liters
Total water needed for 28 days: 120 liters + 48 liters = 168 liters

So, Ivar will need 168 liters of water for the horses for 28 days.
