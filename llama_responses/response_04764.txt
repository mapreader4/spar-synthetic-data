Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Happy currently drinks 15 cups of water every week. To increase her water intake to the recommended level, she needs to take 40% more cups of water than she takes now. This means that the recommended number of cups of water she needs to drink is 15 + 40% of 15.

To find 40% of 15, we can multiply 15 by 0.4. 15 * 0.4 = 6.

So, the recommended number of cups of water Happy needs to drink per week is 15 + 6 = 21.

Answer: 21
