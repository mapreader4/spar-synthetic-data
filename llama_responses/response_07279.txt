Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: The cattle breeder has 52 dairy cows.

Step 2: Each cow gives 1000 oz of milk per day.

Step 3: To find the amount of milk produced per day, we multiply the number of cows by the amount of milk each cow gives per day.

52 cows * 1000 oz/cow = 52000 oz

Answer: 52000
