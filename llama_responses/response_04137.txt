Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of cakes that Diego baked initially.

Diego baked 12 cakes, so the total number of cakes is 12.

Then, Donald ate 1 cake, so we subtract 1 from the total number of cakes.

12 - 1 = 11

Then, we need to subtract the cakes that Donald ate from the remaining cakes.

11 - 1 = 10

So, there are 10 cakes left.
