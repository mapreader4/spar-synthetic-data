Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the percentage of dogs that Harly adopts out.

Harly adopts out 40% of the 80 dogs. To find 40% of 80, we can multiply 80 by 0.4. 80 * 0.4 = 32.

Now, Harly has to take back 5 dogs. So, we subtract 5 from the 32 dogs she has adopted. 32 - 5 = 27.

So, Harly has 27 dogs now.
