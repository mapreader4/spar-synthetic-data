Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of candies sold. Each of the 4 clowns and 30 children received 20 candies, so the total number of candies sold is 4 x 20 = 80. So, the candy seller sold 80 candies.

Now, let's find the total number of candies initially available. The candy seller had 700 candies initially. After selling 80 candies, he is left with 700 - 80 = 620 candies.

Answer: 620
