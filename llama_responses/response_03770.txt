Let's break this problem down step by step.

Matthias has 40 soccer balls and 15 basketballs.

Matthias has 30 soccer balls with a hole in them, which means 30 balls are taken away from the total.

So, 40 - 30 = 10 soccer balls are left without holes.

Matthias has 15 basketballs with a hole in them, which means 7 balls are taken away from the total.

So, 15 - 7 = 8 basketballs are left without holes.

In total, there are 10 soccer balls and 8 basketballs without holes. So, the total number of balls without holes is:

Answer: 10 + 8 = 18
