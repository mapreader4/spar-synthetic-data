Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of steps Nancy takes is x. Since Nancy steps on her partner's feet 3 times as often as Jason, we can say that Jason steps on his partner's feet 3x times.

The total number of steps is 32. So, we can set up an equation to represent the number of steps Jason steps on his partner's feet:

3x = 32

We can then solve for x, the number of steps Nancy takes. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 32 / 3

x = 10

So, Jason steps on his partner's feet 10 times.
