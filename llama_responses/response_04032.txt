Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: there are 70 scientists in total, and half of them are from Europe. This means that 70 / 2 = 35 scientists are from Europe.

We are left with 70 - 35 = 35 scientists from the USA.

So, the number of scientists from the USA is: Answer: 35.
