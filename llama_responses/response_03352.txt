Let's start by identifying the number of each type of item in Sam's collection. We know that there are 10 black pens, 10 * 2 = 20 blue pens, and 8 pencils. We also know that there are 2 fewer red pens than pencils, which means there are 6 red pens. We can add up the total number of pens to find the total number of pens in Sam's collection. 10 + 20 + 6 = 36. So, the total number of pens in Sam's collection is 36.
