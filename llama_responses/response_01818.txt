Let's break it down step by step.

Joel picked 7 peppers on Sunday, 12 on Monday, 14 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, 5 on Thursday, and 12 on Saturday.

The total number of peppers he picked is 7 + 12 + 14 + 12 + 12 + 5 + 12 = 52.

Since 20% of the peppers are hot, we need to find 20% of the total number of peppers. 20% of 52 is 10.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a pepper, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 10.

So, the number of non-hot peppers is 52 - 10 = 42.
