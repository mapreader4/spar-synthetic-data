Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Trisha works in a year.

Trisha works 40 hours per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, we can calculate the total number of hours worked in a year as follows:

40 hours/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 hours/year

Step 2: Calculate Trisha's annual pay.

Trisha's hourly wage is 15 dollars per hour, so we can calculate her annual pay as follows:

2080 hours/year * 15 dollars/hour = 31,200 dollars/year

Step 3: Calculate the amount of pay withheld for taxes, unemployment insurance, and social security.

20 percent of Trisha's pay will be withheld for taxes, unemployment insurance, and social security. We can calculate this amount as follows:

0.2 * 31,200 = 6,240 dollars

Step 4: Calculate Trisha's take-home pay.

Trisha's take-home pay is the total pay minus the amount withheld for taxes, unemployment insurance, and social security.

31,200 - 6,240 = 24,960

Answer: 24,960
