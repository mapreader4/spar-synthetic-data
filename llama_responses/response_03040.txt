Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that Tim is 5 years old. We also know that Rommel is thrice as old as Tim, so Rommel is 3 * 5 = 15 years old. We also know that Jenny is 2 years older than Rommel, so Jenny is 15 + 2 = 17 years old. 

Now we can find the difference between Jenny's age and Tim's age. 17 - 5 = 12. So, Jenny is 12 years older than Tim.
