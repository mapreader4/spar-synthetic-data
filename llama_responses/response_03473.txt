Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of eggs Tricia ordered.

Tricia ordered three dozen eggs. A dozen is equal to 12. So, she ordered 12 eggs.

Next, we know she will use 1/4 of them for making crepes. 1/4 of 12 is equal to 3. So, she will use 3 eggs for making crepes.

Next, she will use 2/3 of the remaining eggs for making cupcakes. 2/3 of 12 is equal to 8. So, she will use 8 eggs for making cupcakes.

To find the number of eggs left, we subtract the 3 eggs used for crepes and the 8 eggs used for cupcakes from the total 12 eggs. 12 - 3 - 8 is equal to 1.
