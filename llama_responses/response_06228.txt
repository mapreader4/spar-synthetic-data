Let's break this problem down step by step.

Ava planted 9 apple trees in her backyard.
Lily planted 3 apple trees in her backyard.

To find the total number of apple trees planted in their backyards, we need to add the number of trees planted by Ava and Lily together.

Ava planted 9 apple trees, and Lily planted 3 apple trees. So, to find the total number of apple trees, we add 9 + 3 = 12.

Answer: 12
