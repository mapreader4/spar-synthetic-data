Let's start by finding the total cost of the football, shorts, and shoes. The football costs 3.75, the shorts cost 2.40, and the shoes cost 11.85. The total cost of these items is:

3.75 + 2.40 + 11.85 = 17.85

Zachary has 10 dollars. To find out how much more money he needs, we can subtract the total cost from his money:

10 - 17.85 = -7.85

Answer: -7.85
