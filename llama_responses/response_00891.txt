Let's start by using a variable to represent Katie's daughter's age. Let's call it x.

Since Lavinia's daughter is 10 years younger than Katie's daughter, we can write the equation x - 10 = Lavinia's daughter's age.

We are given that Katie's daughter is 12 years old, so we know x = 12.

Now, we know that Lavinia's son is 2 times the age of Katie's daughter. So, we can write the equation 2x = Lavinia's son's age.

We know that x = 12, so we can substitute x into the equation 2x = 2(12) to get 24.

So, we know Lavinia's son is 24 years old. We can find the difference between his age and Lavinia's daughter's age by subtracting 12 from 24, which is 24 - 12 = 12.

Answer: 12
