Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first identify the given information:

* 6th graders' average GPA is 93.
* 7th graders' average GPA is 2 more than the 6th graders, so 93 + 2 = 95.
* 8th graders' average GPA is 91.

To find the average GPA for the school, we need to add up the GPAs and divide by the number of grades.

Let's add the GPAs: 93 + 95 + 91 = 219.

There are 3 grades. To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 219 / 3 = 73.

Answer: 73
