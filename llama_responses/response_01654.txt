Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the garden.

The garden is 225 feet long and 125 feet wide. To find the perimeter, we multiply the length and width of the garden: 225 * 2 + 125 * 2 = 450 + 225 + 125 = 900 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the two gates.

The smaller gate is 3 feet wide and the larger gate is 10 feet wide. To find the perimeter of the gates, we add the width of the two gates: 3 + 10 = 13 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the total perimeter of the garden, including the gates.

The total perimeter of the garden is 900 feet and the perimeter of the gates is 13 feet. To find the total perimeter, we add the two values: 900 + 13 = 913 feet.

Answer: 913
