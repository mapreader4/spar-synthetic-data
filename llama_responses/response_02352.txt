Let's break this problem down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance per hour rate.

James drives at 60 mph.  To find the time it takes to drive 360 miles, we can divide 360 by 60, which is 6 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the time for the stop.

James has a 1 hour stop.  We can subtract 1 from 6 to get 5.75 hours.

Step 3: Add the time for the stop to the time it takes to drive to Canada.

James takes 5.75 hours to drive to Canada.

Answer: 5.75
