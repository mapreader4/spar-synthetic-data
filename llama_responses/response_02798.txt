Let's break it down step by step.

John works 12 hours every other day. So, in a 30 day month, he works 12 * 15 = 180 hours.

He gets a 30% raise from his former $20 an hour job. So, his new hourly wage is 1.3 * 20 = 26.

Now, we multiply his total hours worked by his new hourly wage:

180 hours * 26 = 4,680.

Answer: 4680
