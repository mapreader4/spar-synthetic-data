Let's break it down step by step.

Tom and Devin have been teaching for a total of 70 years. Devin has been teaching for 5 less than half the number of years that Tom has. 

Let's start by finding the total number of years Tom has been teaching. Since Tom and Devin have taught for 70 years together, and Devin has been teaching for 5 less than half the number of years that Tom has, we know that the number of years Tom has been teaching is 2 times the number of years Devin has been teaching. 

Let's call the number of years Devin has been teaching x. Since Tom has been teaching for 2 times the number of years Devin has been teaching, we can write the equation: 

Tom = 2x. 

We know that Tom and Devin have been teaching for 70 years together, so we can set up the equation to solve for x. 

70 = 2x. 

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. 

70/2 = x. 

x = 35.

So Tom has been teaching for 35 years.
