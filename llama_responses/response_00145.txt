Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given. James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy and 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune. 

Jeopardy is 20 minutes long, so the total time for Jeopardy is 2 x 20 minutes = 40 minutes.

Wheel of Fortune is twice as long as Jeopardy, so it is 2 x 20 minutes = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.

40 minutes (Jeopardy) + 40 minutes (Wheel of Fortune) = 80 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. To convert minutes to hours, we divide 80 minutes by 60.

80 minutes รท 60 = 1.33 hours.

So, James watched 1.33 hours of TV.
