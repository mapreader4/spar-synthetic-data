Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find out how many push-ups Jackie can do in 1 minute.

Jackie can do 5 push-ups in 10 seconds. So, if we want to find out how many push-ups she can do in 60 seconds (1 minute), we need to find out how many 10 seconds are in 1 minute.

There are 6 10-second intervals in 60 seconds, since 60 seconds is equal to 60 10-second intervals.

So, if Jackie can do 5 push-ups in 10 seconds, she can do 5 * 6 = 30 push-ups in 60 seconds.

Now, she takes two 8-second breaks. So, we need to subtract 2 * 8 = 16 seconds from the 60 seconds, to get the time left.

So, Jackie has 60 - 16 = 44 seconds left. Now, let's find out how many push-ups she can do in 44 seconds.

Jackie can do 5 push-ups in 10 seconds, so she can do 5 * 4.4 = 22 push-ups in 44 seconds.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 22
