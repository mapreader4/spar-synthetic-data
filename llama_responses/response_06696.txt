Let's break this down step by step.

Jack has 65 pounds of sugar today. He will use 18 pounds of sugar tomorrow. That leaves him with:

65 - 18 = 47 pounds of sugar.

The next day, he will buy 50 more pounds of sugar. So, he will have:

47 + 50 = 97 pounds of sugar.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 97
