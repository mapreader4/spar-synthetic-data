Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of books Corey had.

Mike had 45 books, and Corey had twice as many books as Mike. So, Corey had 45 x 2 = 90 books.

Step 2: Find the number of books Mike gave to Lily.

Mike gave 10 books to Lily.

Step 3: Find the number of books Corey gave to Lily.

Corey gave Lily 15 more books than Mike gave. So, Corey gave Lily 10 + 15 = 25 books.

Answer: 25
