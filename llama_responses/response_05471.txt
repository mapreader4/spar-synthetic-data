Let's break it down step by step.

Hani did 3 more situps per minute than Diana did. This means that Hani did 3 + 4 = 7 situps per minute.

Diana did 40 situps at a rate of 4 situps per minute. So, to find the total number of situps Diana did, we can multiply the number of situps by the rate:

40 situps / 4 situps/minute = 10 minutes

Since Diana did situps for 10 minutes, we can multiply the number of situps by the rate to get the total number of situps:

10 minutes * 4 situps/minute = 40 situps

Hani did 7 situps per minute. To find the total number of situps Hani did, we can multiply the number of situps by the rate:

40 minutes * 7 situps/minute = 280 situps

To find the total number of situps they did together, we can add the number of situps Hani did to the number of situps Diana did:

280 situps + 40 situps = 320 situps

Answer: 320
