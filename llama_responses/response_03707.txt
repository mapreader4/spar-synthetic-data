Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total number of chocolate chips and M&M's that Colleen is adding to the batch.

She's adding 108 chocolate chips.
She's adding one-third as many M&M's as there are chocolate chips, which is 108 / 3 = 36 M&M's.

The total number of chocolate chips and M&M's is 108 + 36 = 144.

Now, to find the average number of chocolate pieces in each cookie, we divide the total number of chocolate pieces by the total number of cookies.

The total number of cookies is 48, and the total number of chocolate pieces is 144. So, the average number of chocolate pieces in each cookie is:

144 / 48 = 3
