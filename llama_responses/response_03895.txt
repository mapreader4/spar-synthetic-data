Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Joseph has 16 baseball cards initially.
2. He gave 3/8 of the cards to his brother. To find 3/8 of the cards, we can multiply 16 by 3 and divide by 8, which gives us 6.
3. Then, he gave 2 cards to his brother. This leaves Joseph with 16 - 6 - 2 = 8 cards.
4. So, the percentage of cards left to Joseph is 8/16, which is 50%.

Answer: 50.
