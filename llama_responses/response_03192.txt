Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of blocks of stone that Clara has climbed. We know that she has climbed 96 blocks of stone.

Since each level has 8 steps, and each step is made up of 3 blocks of stone, we can calculate the number of levels as follows:

96 blocks of stone / 3 blocks per step = 96 / 3 = 32 levels

So, there are 32 levels in the tower.
