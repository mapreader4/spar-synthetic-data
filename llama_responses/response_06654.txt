Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many students John has in total. He has 6 classes, and each class has 30 students, so he has 6 * 30 = 180 students in total.

Step 2: Determine how many index cards John needs. He needs 2 packs of index cards for each student, and he has 180 students. So, he needs 2 * 180 = 360 index cards.

Step 3: Since John bought 2 packs of index cards, he must have bought 2 * 180 = 360 index cards.
