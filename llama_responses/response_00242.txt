Let's break it down step by step.

First, Ann bakes three dozen oatmeal raisin cookies, which is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 cookies.

Next, she bakes two dozen sugar cookies, which is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cookies.

Finally, she bakes four dozen chocolate chip cookies, which is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 cookies.

Now, let's add up the number of cookies she bakes: 36 + 24 + 48 = 108.

Then, she gives away two dozen oatmeal raisin cookies, which is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cookies. She also gives away 1.5 dozen sugar cookies, which is equal to 1.5 x 12 = 18 cookies. Finally, she gives away 2.5 dozen chocolate chip cookies, which is equal to 2.5 x 12 = 30 cookies.

So, Ann gives away 24 + 18 + 30 = 72 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies Ann keeps, we subtract the number of cookies she gives away from the total number of cookies she bakes: 108 - 72 = 36.

Answer: 36
