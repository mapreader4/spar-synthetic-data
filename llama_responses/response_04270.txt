Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the weight of the regular dinosaurs. We know each dinosaur weighs 800 pounds. We have 5 of them, so the total weight of the regular dinosaurs is 5 x 800 = 4000 pounds.

Now, we need to find the weight of Barney the dinosaur. We know that Barney weighs 1500 pounds more than the regular dinosaurs, so we can subtract the weight of the regular dinosaurs from Barney's weight to find his weight. So, we subtract 4000 pounds from 1500 pounds to find the weight of Barney: 1500 - 4000 = 1000 pounds.

Answer: 1000
