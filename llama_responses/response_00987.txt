Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Lucy originally had x dollars. If Lucy would give Lucy $5, Lucy would have the same amount of money as Linda. This means that Lucy would have x - 5 dollars.

We know that Lucy originally had $20. So, we can set up an equation: x - 5 = 20.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: x + 5 = 25.

Then, we subtract 5 from both sides again to get x = 25 - 5, which equals 20.

Answer: 20
