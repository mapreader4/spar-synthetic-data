Let's break this down step by step.

1. The hot tub holds 40 gallons of liquid. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so the hot tub can hold 40 x 4 = 160 quarts of liquid.

2. Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart. So, we need to find out how many bottles Jackson needs to buy. 160 quarts / 1 quart = 160 bottles.

3. Each bottle of champagne costs $50, but Jackson gets a 20% discount. The discounted price is 50 x (1 - 0.2) = 40.

4. Jackson needs to buy 160 bottles, and each bottle costs $40. So, the total cost is 160 x 40 = 6400.

Answer: 6400
