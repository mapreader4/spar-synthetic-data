Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the number of hours Kenny played basketball. The problem states that he played 10 hours of basketball.

Now, the problem also states that he ran for twice as long as he played basketball. So, to find the number of hours Kenny ran, we need to multiply 10 hours by 2. 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, the problem also states that Kenny practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran. The number of hours he practiced on the trumpet is equal to the number of hours he ran. So, the number of hours Kenny practiced on the trumpet is 20.

Answer: 20
