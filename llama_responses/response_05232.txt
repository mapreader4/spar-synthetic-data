Let's break down the information given:

* Jill made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, and she used all her coconut scent.
* She used up all her coconut scent, and she used one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent.
* She used one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent, so she used 2/3 of the coconut scent for the almond candles.

Let's represent the amount of coconut scent used for the almond candles as x. Since she used 2/3 of the coconut scent for the almond candles, we can set up the equation:

2x = 1.5 (since 2/3 is the same as 1.5)

We know that the total amount of coconut scent used is the same as the total amount of coconut scent used for the lavender candles, which is 2 times the amount of coconut scent used for the lavender candles. So, we can set up another equation:

2x = 2(2x)

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 2

So, Jill made 2 candles of lavender scent.
