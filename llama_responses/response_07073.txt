Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Leila's original savings be x.

She spent 3/4 of her savings on make-up. To find the amount she spent on make-up, we can multiply 3/4 by x.

3/4 = 0.75, so the amount she spent on make-up is 0.75x.

She spent the rest on a sweater, which was $20. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

0.75x + 20 = x

To solve for x, we can subtract 20 from both sides:

0.75x = x - 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

0.75x = 4(x - 20)

x = 4(0.25)

x = 0.25

So, Leila's original savings were $0.25.
