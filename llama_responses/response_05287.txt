Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with what we know:

1. Charlie lives two floors above Charlie. This means Charlie's floor number is 2.
2. Charlie lives on a floor whose number is 1/4 Frank's floor number. This means Frank's floor number is 4.
3. Frank lives on the 16th floor. 

To find Dennis's floor number, we can subtract 4 from 16 to get 12.

Answer: 12
