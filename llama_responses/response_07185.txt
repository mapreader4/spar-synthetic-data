Let's think step by step.

Avery has 20 chickens. Each chicken lays 6 eggs. So, the total number of eggs laid by Avery's chickens is 20 x 6 = 120 eggs.

Now, each egg carton can hold a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs. To find out how many egg cartons Avery can fill, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each carton can hold:

120 eggs / 12 eggs per carton = 10 cartons

So, Avery can fill 10 egg cartons with eggs.

Answer: 10
