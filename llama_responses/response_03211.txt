Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of pages Coral read on night 1. Coral reads 30 pages on night 1.

Next, let's find the number of pages Coral reads on night 2. Coral reads 2 less than twice the number of pages she read on night 1, which is 2 less than 60. So, Coral reads 60 - 2 = 58 pages on night 2.

Finally, let's find the number of pages Coral reads on night 3. Coral reads 3 more pages than the sum of the first two nights. The sum of the first two nights is 30 + 58 = 88. Coral reads 3 more pages than this sum, so she reads 88 + 3 = 91 pages on night 3.

To find the total number of pages Coral read in the 3 nights, we add up the pages she read on each night. Coral read 30 + 58 + 91 = 179 pages in total.

Answer: 179
