Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Aubrey has a deck of 52 cards initially.
Step 2: She adds two more cards to the deck, so now the total number of cards is 52 + 2 = 54.

Step 3: If she splits the deck evenly among herself and two other players, we need to divide 54 cards into 3 equal parts. To do this, we can divide 54 by 3.

Answer: 54 / 3 = 18.
