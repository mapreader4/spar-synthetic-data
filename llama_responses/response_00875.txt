Let's break it down step by step.

Jerry needs to buy a black-and-white cartridge and three color cartridges. The cost of a black-and-white cartridge is $27. The cost of each color cartridge is $32.

The total cost of the black-and-white cartridge is $27. The total cost of the three color cartridges is 3 x $32 = $96. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the black-and-white cartridge and the cost of the color cartridges.

So, the total cost is 27 + 96 = $123.

Answer: 123
