Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find out how much money Sally has. We know that if she had $20 less, she would have $80. So, she must have $80 + $20 = $100.

Now, let's find out how much money Jolly has. We know that if Jolly has $20 more, she would have $70. So, she has $70 - $20 = $50.

To find the total amount of money Sally and Jolly have, we need to add the amount of money they each have. Sally has $100 and Jolly has $50. $100 + $50 = $150.

Answer: 150
