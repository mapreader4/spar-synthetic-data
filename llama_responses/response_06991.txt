Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of pieces Luke had at the start of the second day. We know that 10% of 1000 is 100, so Luke had 100 pieces left. On the second day, he put together 20% of the remaining pieces from the first day, which is 20% of 100 = 20. So, he has 80 pieces left.

On the third day, he put together 30% of the remaining pieces from the previous day. Since he has 80 pieces left, 30% of 80 is 24. So, he has 56 pieces left.

Answer: 56
