Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Tom's fruit bowl contains 3 oranges and 6 lemons.
2. Tom eats 3 of the fruits.
3. So, we subtract 3 fruits from the total number of fruits in the fruit bowl.
4. 3 oranges - 3 fruits = 0 oranges left.
5. 6 lemons - 0 lemons = 6 lemons left.
6. In total, there are 0 oranges and 6 lemons left in the fruit bowl.
