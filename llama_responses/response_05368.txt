Let's break down the information given:

* 30 pieces of pepperoni
* 2 times as many pieces of ham as pepperoni
* 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni
* 6 slices of pizza

We know that there are 30 pieces of pepperoni. Let's call the number of ham pieces x. Since there are 2 times as many pieces of ham as pepperoni, then the number of ham pieces is 30 * 2 = 60. Adding the 12 more pieces of sausage, we get 60 + 12 = 72 pieces of meat.

Now, since everything is distributed evenly among 6 slices of pizza, we can divide the total number of pieces of meat by the number of slices:

72 / 6 = 12

Answer: 12
