Let's break it down step by step:

1. Gerald is sentenced to 3 months for assault and 2 years for poisoning. This means the total amount of time he is sentenced to is 3 months + 24 months, which is 27 months.
2. The judge extends his sentence by 1/3, which is 9 months. So, the total amount of time Gerald spends in jail is 27 months + 9 months, which is 36 months.
3. We need to convert 36 months to months. Since 36 months is equal to 3 years, Gerald spends 3 years in jail.
