Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of tins of beans initially. There are 15 cases of tins, and each case contains 24 tins. So, the total number of tins is 15 * 24 = 360.

Now, 5% of the tins are damaged and thrown away. To find the number of tins that are thrown away, multiply the total number of tins by 5%:

360 * 0.05 = 18

So, 18 tins are thrown away.

To find the number of tins left, subtract the number of tins thrown away from the total number of tins:

360 - 18 = 342

Answer: 342
