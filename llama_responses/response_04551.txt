Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Maria's birthday is in 22 days. This means that Lilly will save $2 each day for 21 days before her birthday. 

Now, we need to find out how many flowers Lilly can buy. Each flower costs $4. We can multiply the amount of money Lilly has by the number of days she can save.

So, Lilly can save $2 each day for 21 days. So, she will have $42 in total. If each flower costs $4, we can divide 42 by 4 to find out how many flowers Lilly can buy.

42 divided by 4 is 10.5. So, Lilly can buy 10 flowers.
