Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: First, we need to find the total number of insects collected by the class. The total number of insects collected by the class is 200 (boys) + 300 (girls) = 500.

Step 2: We need to divide the total number of insects into 4 equal groups. To do this, we need to divide 500 by 4. 500 / 4 = 125.

Answer: 125
