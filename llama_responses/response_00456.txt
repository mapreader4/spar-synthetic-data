Let's break down the problem step by step.

Chad earns $600 from mowing yards and receives $250 for his birthday/holidays. So, he has a total of $600 + $250 = $850.00.

He also makes $150 by selling some old video games and another $150 by doing odd jobs. So, his total income is $850 + $150 + $150 = $1150.00.

Chad saves 40% of his income, so he will save 0.4 x $1150.00 = $460.00.
