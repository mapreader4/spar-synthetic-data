Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, Brooke milks 12 cows, each of which produces 4 gallons of milk. So, she has a total of:

12 x 4 = 48 gallons of milk.

She sells 6 gallons of milk to each of the 6 customers, so she sells a total of:

6 x 6 = 36 gallons of milk.

She has 48 - 36 = 12 gallons of milk left over.

She turns the remaining milk into butter, with 1 gallon of milk equaling 2 sticks of butter. So, she has:

12 gallons of milk / 1 gallon per 2 sticks = 24 sticks of butter.

She sells each stick of butter for $1.5, so she earns:

24 sticks x $1.5 = $36 from the butter.

She sells the 36 gallons of milk she sold at $3 per gallon, so she earns:

36 gallons x $3 = $108 from the milk.

In total, she earns $108 from the milk and $36 from the butter. Therefore, her total earnings are:

$108 + $36 = $144.

Answer: 144
