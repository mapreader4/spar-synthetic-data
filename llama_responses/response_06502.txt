Let's break it down step by step.

Ivan has a piggy bank that can hold 100 pennies, which is 100 cents. He also has a piggy bank that can hold 50 dimes, which is 50 cents.

So, Ivan has a total of 100 cents in his piggy bank that holds pennies and 50 cents in his piggy bank that holds dimes.

To find the total amount of money Ivan has, we need to add the number of cents from both piggy banks. We can do this by adding 100 cents from the piggy bank that holds pennies and 50 cents from the piggy bank that holds dimes.

100 cents + 50 cents is equal to 150 cents.

Answer: 150
