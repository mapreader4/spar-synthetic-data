Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy. So, if we let x be the number of dolls Ivy has, then Dina has 2x dolls.

We are also given that 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions. If Ivy has 20 collectors edition dolls, then 2/3 of 20 is 2/3 * 20, which is 13. So, Ivy has 13 collectors edition dolls.

So, 2x is 2 * 13, which is 26. So, Dina has 26 dolls.
