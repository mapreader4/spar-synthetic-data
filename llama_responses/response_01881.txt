Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: 
- A bird eats 7 berries a day.
- Samuel has 5 birds.

Let's find out how many berries each bird eats in a day. 
A bird eats 7 berries a day. So, each bird eats 7 berries a day.

Now, we need to find out how many berries all the birds eat in 4 days. 
Each bird eats 7 berries a day, so to find the total number of berries eaten, we multiply the number of berries each bird eats a day by the number of days. 
7 * 4 = 28. 

Answer: 28
