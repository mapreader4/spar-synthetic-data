Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Let the population of Wellington be x.
2. The population of Port Perry is seven times the population of Wellington, so the population of Port Perry is 7x.
3. The population of Port Perry is 800 more than the population of Lazy Harbor, so the population of Lazy Harbor is x - 800.
4. The population of Port Perry is the sum of the population of Wellington and the population of Lazy Harbor, so 7x + (x - 800).
5. We know that the population of Wellington is 900, so we can substitute x = 900.
6. Now we can substitute x into the equation 7x + (x - 800), and solve for x.
7. 7x + (x - 800) = 7(900) + (900 - 800) = 7(900) + 100.
8. 7(900) + 100 = 6300 + 100 = 6400.

Answer: 6400
