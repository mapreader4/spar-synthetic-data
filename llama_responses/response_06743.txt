Let's start by calculating the cost of feeding the cattle. If it cost 20% more than the cost of the cattle, then the cost of feeding the cattle is 1.2 times the cost of the cattle, which is 1.2 x 40000 = 48000.

The cattle weigh 1000 pounds each, and they sell for 2 dollars per pound. So the total weight of the cattle is 1000 x 100 = 100,000 pounds. The total revenue is 100,000 x 2 = 200,000. The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost, which is 200,000 - 48,000 = 152,000.

Answer: 152,000.
