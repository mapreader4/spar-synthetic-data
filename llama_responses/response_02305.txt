Let's start by identifying the ratio of the parts.

The ratio of the parts is 2:3, which means that the length of the shorter part is 2/3 of the total length of the rope.

The total length of the rope is 40 meters, and the ratio is 2:3, so the shorter part is 2/3 of 40, which is:

2/3 * 40 = 40/3 = 26.67

So, the answer is:

Answer: 26.67
