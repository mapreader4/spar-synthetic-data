Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information.

- 40% of 500 students are juniors.
- 70% of juniors are involved in sports.

We can find the number of juniors involved in sports by multiplying the two percentages together.

First, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

40% = 0.4
70% = 0.7

Now, we can multiply these decimals together:

0.4 x 0.7 = 0.28

Now, we can multiply this decimal by the total number of students:

0.28 x 500 = 140

Answer: 140
