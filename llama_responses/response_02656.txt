Let's start by identifying the tagged numbers.

W is tagged with 200.
X is tagged with half of W, which is 200 / 2 = 100.
Y is tagged with the total of X and W's tags, which is 100 + 200 = 300.
Z is tagged with 400.

Now, let's add up all the tagged numbers:

200 + 100 + 300 + 400 = 600

Answer: 600
