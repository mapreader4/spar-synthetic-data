Let's break it down step by step:

1. Andrew ate 14 donuts on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, he ate half as many as he did on Monday, so he ate 14/2 = 7 donuts.
3. On Wednesday, he ate 4 times as many as he did on Monday, so he ate 14 * 4 = 56 donuts.

Adding the number of donuts for the three days, we get:
14 + 7 + 56 = 77.

Answer: 77
