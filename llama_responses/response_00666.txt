Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Jackson has x dollars, and Williams has y dollars. The problem states that Jackson has 5 times as much money as Williams, so we know that x = 5y.

We know that the total money they have is 150 dollars, so we can set up the equation as:

x + y = 150

We can subtract y from both sides of the equation to get x = 150 - y.

The problem asks for Jackson's money, so we need to know what x is. We can substitute x for x in the equation to get:

x = 150 - y

We don't know what y is, but we know that x = 5y. We can substitute this in the equation:

5y = 150 - y

We can subtract y from both sides of the equation to get 5y - y = 150.

We can subtract y from both sides of the equation to get:

5 - 1 = 150

The answer is:

Answer: 5
