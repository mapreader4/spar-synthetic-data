Let's break it down step by step.

1. The original price of the ping pong balls is $.10 each.
2. The total number of ping pong balls Johnny buys is 10000.
3. The discount is 30% of the original price.
4. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage. In this case, we multiply.10 by 0.30 to get 0.03.
5. To find the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price. We subtract 0.03 from 10.00 to get the discounted price. 10.00 - 0.03 = 9.97.
6. Johnny pays the discounted price, which is $9.97.

Answer: 9.97
