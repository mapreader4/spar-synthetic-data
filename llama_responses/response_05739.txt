Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how much money Vanessa has in savings.

She has $20 in savings initially, and her parents give her $30 every week. So, in one week, she will have $20 + $30 = $50 in savings.

Let's find out how many weeks it will take Vanessa to save $80.

To find out how many weeks it will take, we will divide $80 by $50. We get:

$80 รท $50 = 1.6

So, Vanessa will have to wait 1.6 weeks to gather enough money to buy the dress.
