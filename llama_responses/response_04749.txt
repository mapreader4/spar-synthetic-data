Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of bones Lassie started with is x.

Lassie eats half of her bones on Saturday. So, she eats x/2 bones.

She received 10 more bones on Sunday. So, she now has x - x/2 + 10 bones.

The total number of bones she has is 35. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x - x/2 + 10 = 35

We can solve for x by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x - x/2 = 35 - 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x/2 = 25

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Lassie started with 50 bones.
