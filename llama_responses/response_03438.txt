Let's break this problem down step by step.

Day 1: Penn made $10.

Day 2: Penn made $10 + 4 = $14.

Day 3: Penn made $14 + 4 = $18.

Day 4: Penn made $18 + 4 = $22.

Day 5: Penn made $22 + 4 = $26.

To find the total amount of money Penn made, we add up the amount of money she made each day:

$10 + $14 + $18 + $22 + $26 = $80

Answer: $80
