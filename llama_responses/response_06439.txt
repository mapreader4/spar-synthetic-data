Let's break this down step by step.

1. Geli is committed to her 3 times a week workout, so she will do 3 workouts.

2. On her first day, she does 10 push-ups.

3. Her fitness trainer encourages her to add 5 push-ups each day.

4. So, on each of the 3 days after the first day, she will do 5 more push-ups, making it 5 * 3 = 15 more push-ups.

5. We need to find the total number of push-ups she will do throughout the week.

10 + 15 = 25

Answer: 25
