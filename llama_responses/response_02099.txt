Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be the number of books Stu has. Then, we know that Laura has twice as many books as Stu, so we can write an equation:

Laura's books = 2 * Stu's books

We are given that Elmo has 3 times as many books as Laura, so we can write another equation:

Elmo's books = 3 * Laura's books

We know that Elmo has 24 books. We can substitute the value of Elmo's books into the equation:

24 = 3 * Laura's books

Now we can solve for Laura's books:

Laura's books = 24 / 3 = 8

So, Laura has 8 books.

Now, we can find Stu's books by using the fact that Laura has twice as many books as Stu:

Stu's books = Laura's books / 2

Stu's books = 8 / 2 = 4
