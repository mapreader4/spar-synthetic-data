Let's break this problem down step by step.

The family had 10 eggs initially.

The mother used 5 eggs to make an omelet, so the family has 10 - 5 = 5 eggs left.

Then, 2 chickens laid 3 eggs each, so the family got 2 x 3 = 6 more eggs.

So, the family has 5 + 6 = 11 eggs left.

Answer: 11
