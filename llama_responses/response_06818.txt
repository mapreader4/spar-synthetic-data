Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* 1 chocolate bar costs $1.50
* Each chocolate bar can be broken into 3 sections to make 3 s'mores
* Ron wants each scout to have 2 s'mores, and there are 15 scouts

Since each scout will have 2 s'mores, and each chocolate bar makes 3 s'mores, we can divide 2 s'mores by 3 to find out how many chocolate bars are needed for each scout: 2 s'mores ÷ 3 = 2/3 of a chocolate bar per scout.

Since there are 15 scouts, we can multiply the number of chocolate bars per scout by the number of scouts to find the total number of chocolate bars needed: 2/3 × 15 = 10 chocolate bars

Since each chocolate bar costs $1.50, we can multiply the number of chocolate bars needed by the cost per bar to find the total cost: 10 chocolate bars × $1.50 per bar = $15

Answer: 15
