Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of dogs, cats, and fish.

There are 6 dogs for sale.
There are half as many cats, so 6 / 2 = 3 cats for sale.
There are twice as many birds, so 6 * 2 = 12 birds for sale.
There are thrice as many fish, so 6 * 3 = 18 fish for sale.

Now, let's add up the number of animals for sale:

Dogs: 6
Cats: 3
Birds: 12
Fish: 18

The total number of animals for sale is:

6 + 3 + 12 + 18 = 29

Answer: 29
