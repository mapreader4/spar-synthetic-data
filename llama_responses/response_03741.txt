Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by converting the number of steps to minutes. Since Roger walks 2,000 steps in 30 minutes, he walks 2,000 / 30 = 66.666 steps per minute.

Now, let's find the number of minutes it will take Roger to reach his daily goal of 10,000 steps. Since he walks 66.666 steps per minute, he will walk 10,000 steps in:

10,000 / 66.666 = 150 minutes

Answer: 150
