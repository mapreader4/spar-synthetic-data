Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Mike is 16 years old, and his sister Barbara is half as old as he is. This means that Barbara is 16 / 2 = 8 years old.

Now, we want to know how old Barbara will be when Mike is 24 years old. Since Barbara is currently 8 years old, and Mike is 8 years younger than her, we can find her age when Mike is 24 years old by adding 16 to her current age. 8 + 16 = 24.

Answer: 24
