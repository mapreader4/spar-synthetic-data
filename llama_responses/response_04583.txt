Let's break down the pizza order:

* Ruby's son wants a pepperoni pizza, which is 1 pizza and 1 topping (pepperoni).
* Ruby's daughter wants a sausage pizza, which is 1 pizza and 1 topping (sausage).
* Ruby and her husband want a black olive and mushroom pizza, which is 1 pizza and 2 toppings (black olive and mushroom).

So, in total, Ruby needs to order 3 pizzas and 4 toppings.

The cost of each pizza is $10.00, so the total cost of the pizzas is:
3 pizzas x $10.00 per pizza = $30.00

The cost of each topping is $1.00, so the total cost of the toppings is:
4 toppings x $1.00 per topping = $4.00

The total cost of the pizza order, including the tip, is:
$30.00 (pizzas) + $4.00 (toppings) + $5.00 (tip) = $39.00
