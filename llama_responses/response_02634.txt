Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the price of the math textbook outside the school bookshop. Since it is 20% less than the school bookshop's price, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the price of the math textbook outside the school bookshop. Then, we can set up the equation:

x = 0.8 × 45

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 100:

x = 0.8 × 45
x = 36

So, the price of the math textbook outside the school bookshop is $36.

Now, let's find how much Peter can save by buying from other bookshops. The difference between the school bookshop's price and the outside price is:

45 - 36 = 9

So, Peter can save $9 by buying from other bookshops.

Since Peter wants to buy 3 math textbooks, he can save a total of:

9 × 3 = 27

So, the answer is:

Answer: 27
