Let's break this problem down step by step.

On the first day, the business executive receives 16 new emails. This is our starting point.

On the second day, he receives half as many new emails as he received on the first day. Half of 16 is 8, so he receives 8 new emails on the second day.

On the third day, he receives half as many new emails as he received on the second day. Half of 8 is 4, so he receives 4 new emails on the third day.

On the fourth day, he receives half as many new emails as he received on the third day. Half of 4 is 2, so he receives 2 new emails on the fourth day.

In total, he receives 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 new emails.
