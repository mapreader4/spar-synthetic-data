Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how much Tim drinks in a day. He drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts. So, he drinks 2 x 1.5 = 3 quarts in a day.

Now, he also drinks 20 ounces a day. We need to convert quarts to ounces. 1 quart is equal to 32 ounces. So, 1.5 quarts is equal to 32 x 1.5 = 48 ounces.

So, in a day, Tim drinks 3 quarts which is 48 ounces, and 20 ounces. So, he drinks 48 + 20 = 68 ounces in a day.

Now, we need to find out how much he drinks in a week. There are 7 days in a week. So, we multiply the amount of ounces he drinks a day by 7.

68 ounces a day * 7 = 476 ounces in a week.

Answer: 476
