Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the income and expenses.

Income: $65,000

Expenses:

1. Rent: $20,000
2. Groceries: $5,000
3. Gas: $8,000

Total expenses: $20,000 + $5,000 + $8,000 = $33,000

To have at least $42,000 left, he needs to make at least $42,000 - $33,000 = $9,000 more each year.

Answer: 9,000
