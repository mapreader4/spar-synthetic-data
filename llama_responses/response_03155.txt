Let's break this down step by step.

First, Thomas and his 4 friends take 1/4 of the bars, which is:

200 bars x 1/4 = 50 bars

So, 50 bars are taken out of the box. Now, there are:

200 bars - 50 bars = 150 bars

left in the box.

One of Thomas's friends returns 5 bars to the box, so:

150 bars + 5 bars = 155 bars

are now in the box.

Piper takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends. Thomas and his friends took 50 bars, so Piper takes:

50 bars - 5 bars = 45 bars

Now, there are:

155 bars - 45 bars = 110 bars

left in the box.

Answer: 110
