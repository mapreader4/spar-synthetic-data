Let's start by finding the area of the lot that needs to be covered in grass seeds. We can do this by subtracting the area of the section that will be covered in concrete from the total area of the lot.

The total area of the lot is 120 feet by 60 feet, which is:

120 x 60 = 7200 square feet

The area of the section that will be covered in concrete is 40 feet by 40 feet, which is:

40 x 40 = 1600 square feet

So, the area of the lot that needs to be covered in grass seeds is:

7200 - 1600 = 5600 square feet

Next, we can divide the area of the lot that needs to be covered in grass seeds by the area that one bag of grass seeds can cover:

5600 square feet (lot area) รท 56 square feet (per bag) = 100 bags

So, Amanda needs 100 bags of grass seeds.
