Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the first bell, which takes 50 pounds of bronze. This is the base amount of bronze needed.

The second bell is twice the size of the first bell, so it takes 2 x 50 = 100 pounds of bronze.

The third bell is four times the size of the second bell, so it takes 4 x 100 = 400 pounds of bronze.

To find the total amount of bronze needed, we add the weights of the three bells:

50 + 100 + 400 = 550 pounds of bronze.

Answer: 550
