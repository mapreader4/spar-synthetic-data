Let's break this down step by step.

Holly needs 2 insulin pills per day, which is 2 x 7 = 14 pills in a week.

Holly needs 3 blood pressure pills per day, which is 3 x 7 = 21 pills in a week.

Holly needs twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills each day, which is 2 x 3 = 6 pills per day, and in a week, that is 6 x 7 = 42 pills.

Adding up the number of pills, we get:

2 + 21 + 42 = 65

So, Holly takes 65 pills in a week.
