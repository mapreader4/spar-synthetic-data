Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of pages Beatrix read is x.

Then, Cristobal read 15 more than three times the number of pages Beatrix read, so Cristobal read 3x pages more than Beatrix.

So, Cristobal read 3x + 15 pages.

We know that Beatrix read 704 pages. So, we can set up an equation:

3x + 15 = 704

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to get:

3x = 704 - 15

3x = 689

So, Cristobal read 689 pages.

Answer: 689
