Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of people who will be at the party. We know that there will be 42 people at the party.

We know that each batch of guacamole requires 4 avocados. To find the total number of avocados needed, we need to multiply the number of batches needed by the number of people.

The number of batches of guacamole needed is 42 people / 6 people per batch = 7 batches.

Since each batch requires 4 avocados, the total number of avocados needed is 7 batches * 4 avocados = 28 avocados.

Answer: 28
