Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the combined weight of the two bags:

A bag full of sugar weighs 16 kg.
A bag full of salt weighs 30 kg.

The combined weight of the two bags is 16 + 30 = 46 kg.

Now, if we remove 4 kg from the combined weight of these two bags, we need to subtract 4 kg from 46 kg.

46 - 4 = 42

So, the bags now weigh 42 kg.

Answer: 42
