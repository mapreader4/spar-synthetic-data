Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

* Saturday, Tanika sold 60 boxes of crackers.
* On Sunday, she sold 50% more than on Saturday.

To find the total number of boxes sold over the two days, we need to find the number of boxes sold on Sunday. Since she sold 50% more on Sunday than on Saturday, we can find the number of boxes sold on Sunday by adding 50% to the 60 boxes sold on Saturday. To do this, we can multiply the number of boxes sold on Saturday by 1.5, since 50% is the same as 0.5, which is 1/2, or 0.5. So, we can multiply 60 by 1.5 to get the number of boxes sold on Sunday. This is 60 * 1.5 = 90.

So, the total number of boxes sold over the two days is 60 + 90, which is 150.

Answer: 150
