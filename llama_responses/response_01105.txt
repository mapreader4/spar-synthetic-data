Let's break it down step by step.

Gina had $400 initially.

She gave 1/4 of her money to her mom, so she has 3/4 left.

Then, she used 1/8 of her money to buy clothes, so she has 3/4 - 1/8 = 7/8 of her money left.

Next, she gave 1/5 of her money to a charity, so she has 7/8 - 1/5 = 7/8 - 1/5 = 3/5 of her money left.

So, Gina has 3/5 of her money left.

To find out how much Gina kept, we multiply 3/5 by 400, which is 240.
