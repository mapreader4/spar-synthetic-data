Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. John reels in 3 crab baskets a week.
2. Each basket holds 4 crabs.
3. He collects crabs twice a week.
4. Each crab sells for $3.

Let's calculate the total number of crabs per week:

3 * 4 crabs per basket * 2 (since he collects crabs twice a week) = 12 crabs per week

Now, let's calculate the total money John makes in a week:

12 crabs per week * $3 per crab = 36 dollars per week

Answer: 36
