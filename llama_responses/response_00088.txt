Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of geckos Brandon sold last year. It is 86.

Then, let's find the number of geckos he sold the year before. It is twice that number. So, the number of geckos he sold the year before is 86 * 2 = 172.

So, the total number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years is 86 + 172 = 258.

Answer: 258
