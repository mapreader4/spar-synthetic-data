Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the number of regular hours Janet works in a week: 52 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the number of overtime hours Janet works in a week: 52 - 40 = 12 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Janet earns in a week: 52 * $20 = $1040.

Step 4: Calculate the amount Janet earns in overtime: 12 * 1.5 * $20 = $36.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Janet earns in a week: $1040 + $36 = $1076.

Step 6: Calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to earn $4640: $4640 / $1076 = 4.33 weeks.
