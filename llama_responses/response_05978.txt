Let's start by identifying the number of large beads: 528.

Since each bracelet uses 12 large beads, and there are equal amounts of large and small beads, we know that the number of small beads is also 528.

Let's find the total number of beads in total: 528 + 528 = 1056.

Since each bracelet uses 12 large beads, the number of bracelets Caitlin can make is 528 / 12 = 44.

So, Caitlin can make 44 bracelets this weekend.

Answer: 44
