Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, Troy has saved $50. He wants to buy a new computer that is worth $80. To find out how much more he needs, we need to subtract the amount he has from the cost of the computer.

$80 (cost of the computer) - $50 (Troy's savings) =?

To subtract these values, we can do so by subtracting 50 from 80.

$80 - $50 = $30

So, Troy needs $30 more to buy the new computer.

Answer: 30
