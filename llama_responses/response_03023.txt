Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Lola and Dora combined their allowance of $9 each, so they have a total of $18 to spend.
2. They spent $10 on a deck of playing cards, so they have $8 left over.
3. They also bought 2 boxes of stickers, which cost $2 each, so the total cost of the stickers was $4.
4. They split the boxes evenly, so each of them gets 4 boxes of stickers.
5. To find out how many stickers are in each box, we can divide the total number of stickers by the number of boxes. The total number of stickers is 2 * 12 = 24. So, the number of stickers in each box is 24 / 4 = 6.
