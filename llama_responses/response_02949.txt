Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's find the total time the daughters used the bathroom. The oldest daughter used the bathroom for 45 minutes and the youngest daughter used it for 30 minutes. So, the total time the daughters used the bathroom is 45 + 30 = 75 minutes.

Then, the husband used the bathroom for 20 minutes. So, we add 20 to the total time the daughters used the bathroom, which is 75 + 20 = 95 minutes.

Mrs. Parker needs to leave the house at 5 pm, and it's currently 2:30 pm. To find the time Mrs. Parker will have to use the bathroom, we need to subtract the time the family used the bathroom from the time she needs to leave. The time she needs to leave is 5 pm, and the time the family used the bathroom is 2:30 pm. So, the time she has left is 5 pm - 2:30 pm = 2:30 pm.

Now, we need to subtract the time Mrs. Parker will use the bathroom from the time she has left. The time she has left is 2:30 pm, and she will use the bathroom for 95 minutes. To find the time she will use the bathroom, we subtract 95 from 2:30, which is 2:30 - 1:35 = 1:35 pm.

So, Mrs. Parker will use the bathroom until 1:35 pm to leave the house.
