Let's break down the time it takes Matthew to make his coffee cakes:

1. Assembling ingredients: 1 hour
2. Baking the cakes: 1.5 hours (but on this day, it took twice as long, so 1.5 x 2 = 3 hours)
3. Decorating each cake: 1 hour

Total time it usually takes Matthew to make his coffee cakes: 1 + 1.5 + 1 = 3.5 hours

On this day, the baking process took twice as long, so we add the extra time to the total:

3.5 hours (usual time) + 1.5 hours (extra time due to oven failure) = 5 hours

Answer: 5
