Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jack goes hunting 6 times a month, so he goes hunting 6 x 4 = 24 times in a year, since there are 4 quarters in a year.

2. He catches 2 deers each time he goes hunting, so he catches 2 x 24 = 48 deers in a year.

3. Each deer weighs 600 pounds, so the total weight of the deer is 48 x 600 = 28,800 pounds.

4. He keeps half the weight of the deer, so he keeps 28,800 / 2 = 14,400 pounds.

Answer: 14,400
