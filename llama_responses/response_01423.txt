Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

1. Patrick traveled to 3 times the number of countries Joseph traveled to.
2. Joseph traveled to half the number of countries George traveled to.
3. George traveled to 6 countries.

From the information in point 3, we know that George traveled to 6 countries. So, to find the number of countries Joseph traveled to, we need to find half of 6. Half of 6 is 3. So, Joseph traveled to 3 countries.

Now, to find the number of countries Zack traveled to, we know that Patrick traveled to 3 times the number of countries Joseph traveled to. Since Joseph traveled to 3 countries, Patrick traveled to 3 * 3 = 9 countries.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 9
