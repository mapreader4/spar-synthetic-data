Let's first convert the cost of the gallon container to ounces. 1 gallon is equal to 128 ounces.  So, the cost of the gallon container is 8 * 16 = 128 ounces, which is 16 dollars.  Now, the difference between the cost of the gallon container and the cost of the 16-ounce bottle is 16 - 3 = 13 dollars.  So, Jim saves 3 dollars by buying the gallon container.
