Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total growth of the first tree. It grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days, it will grow 4 meters.

The second tree grows the same amount in half the time, so it will grow half of 4, or 2 meters, in 4 days.

The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days, it will grow 8 meters.

The fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day, so it will grow 2 + 8 = 10 meters in 4 days.

To find the total growth of all four trees, we add up the growth of each tree: 4 + 2 + 8 + 10 = 24.

Answer: 24
