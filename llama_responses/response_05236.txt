Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of treats John's dog will get in a month.

The dog gets 2 treats a day, and there are 30 days in a month. So, the total number of treats the dog gets is 2 x 30 = 60.

The treats cost $.1 each, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of treats by the cost of each treat.

60 * 0.1 = 6.0

So, John spends 6.0 on the treats.
