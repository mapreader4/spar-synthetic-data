Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find the total number of hours worked by each employee:

Fiona worked for 40 hours per week, so her total hours are 40 * 4 = 160 hours per month.
John worked for 30 hours per week, so his total hours are 30 * 4 = 120 hours per month.
Jeremy worked for 25 hours per week, so his total hours are 25 * 4 = 100 hours per month.

Now, let's add up their total hours:
160 + 120 + 100 = 280 hours.

Now, let's find the total amount of money paid to the employees:
280 hours * 20 = 5600.

Answer: 5600
