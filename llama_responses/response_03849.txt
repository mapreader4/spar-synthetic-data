Let's break this problem down step by step.

Randy had some money initially. He spent $10 on his lunch. So, we can subtract $10 from the money he had initially to find out how much he had at first.

Let's say the amount of money Randy had initially is x.

After spending $10, Randy has x - $10 left.

He spent a quarter of the money he had left on an ice cream cone. A quarter of the money is one-fourth of the money. So, if we let x be the amount of money Randy had initially, then a quarter of that is x/4.

The ice cream cone cost $5. So, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - 10 = (x/4) - 5

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x - 10 = x/4 - 5 + 5

x - 10 = x/4

We can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get:

x = x/4 + 5

Now, we can add 10 to both sides of the equation to get:

x = 10 + x/4

Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get:

4x = 40

We can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get:

x = 40/4

x = 10

Answer: 10
