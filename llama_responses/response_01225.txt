Let's break it down step by step.

Donovan is currently averaging 26 points per game. This means that the total points he has scored so far is 26 * 15 = 390 points.

For the entire 20 game season, Donovan wants to average 30 points per game. To find out how many points he needs to average per game, we need to subtract the total points he has scored so far from the total points he wants to score.

The total points he wants to score is 30 * 20 = 600 points. So, the points he needs to average per game is 600 - 390 = 210.

Answer: 210
