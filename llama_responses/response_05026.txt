To find the average amount of fish that each person caught, we can add up the total number of fish caught by each person and then divide it by the number of people.

Aang caught 7 fish, Sokka caught 5 fish, and Toph caught 12 fish. To find the total number of fish caught, we add these numbers together: 7 + 5 + 12 = 24.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total number of fish by 3 to find the average amount of fish that each person caught. 24 / 3 = 8.

Answer: 8
