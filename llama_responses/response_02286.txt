Let's think step by step.

Let's start by identifying the amount of money Marta has collected: $240 + $50 = $290.

Then, we know that for every hour Marta works, she receives $10. So, to find out how many hours she has worked, we can divide the total amount of money she has collected by the amount she receives per hour.

290 / 10 = 29

So, Marta has worked 29 hours on the farm.
