Let's break this down step by step.

The booth makes $50 selling popcorn each day, so for 5 days, the total amount of popcorn sold would be:

50 x 5 = 250

The booth makes three times as much selling cotton candy as popcorn, so the total amount of cotton candy sold would be:

250 x 3 = 750

The booth has to pay $30 for the rent and $75 for the cost of the ingredients, so the total amount of money spent would be:

30 + 75 = 105

To find the amount of money the booth earned, we need to subtract the amount spent from the total amount of popcorn and cotton candy sold:

250 + 750 = 1000

Subtract the amount spent:

1000 - 105 = 895

Answer: 895
