Let's break it down step by step.

Karen wants to assign 4 hours of homework. Since each short-answer question takes 3 minutes to answer, that means she can fit in 8 short-answer questions in an hour. Each paragraph takes 15 minutes to write, so she can fit in 4 paragraphs in an hour. If she assigns 2 essays, that takes an hour each, she can fit in 2 essays.

Let's find the total number of short-answer questions. For 8 short-answer questions in an hour, she can fit in 4 hours. 4 hours is equal to 240 minutes, and 240 minutes is equal to 16 short-answer questions.

So, Karen should assign 16 short-answer questions.
