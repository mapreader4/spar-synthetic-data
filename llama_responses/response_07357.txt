Let's start by finding the area of the rectangular patch.

The area of the rectangular patch is 6 inches by 7 inches. The area is 6 x 7 = 42 square inches.

Next, we need to find the area of the square path. The area of the square path is 5 inches by 5 inches. The area is 5 x 5 = 25 square inches.

The total area that needs to be filled is the area of the rectangular patch plus the area of the square path. 42 + 25 = 67 square inches.

Since it takes 3 grams of sand to fill one square inch, the total amount of sand needed is 3 x 67 = 201 grams.
