Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. UF scored a total of 720 points in 24 games, so their average score per game is 720 / 24 = 30 points per game.

2. In the championship game, UF scored 2 points less than half of their average score, which is 30 - 2 = 28 points.

3. The opponent scored 2 points more than UF, so they scored 28 + 2 = 30 points.

Answer: 30
