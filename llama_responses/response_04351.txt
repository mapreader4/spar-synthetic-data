Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how much Joe spent on notebooks. Each notebook costs $4, and Joe bought 7 notebooks. So, the total cost of notebooks is:

7 x 4 = 28

So, Joe spent $28 on notebooks.

Next, let's find out how much Joe spent on books. Each book costs $7, and Joe bought 2 books. So, the total cost of books is:

2 x 7 = 14

So, Joe spent $14 on books.

Now, let's find out how much Joe has left. Joe started with $56, and he spent a total of:

28 + 14 = 42

So, Joe has $14 left.

Answer: 14
