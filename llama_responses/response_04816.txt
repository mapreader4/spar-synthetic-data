Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mrs. Crocker made 11 pieces of fried chicken.
2. Lyndee ate one piece, so that leaves 11 - 1 = 10 pieces of chicken left.
3. Each of Lyndee's friends got to eat 2 pieces, so the total number of pieces eaten by her friends is 2 x? (since each friend ate 2 pieces).
4. Let's call the number of friends x. Then, the total number of pieces eaten by friends is 2x.
5. Since the total number of pieces eaten by friends is 10 (from step 2), we can set up the equation: 2x = 10.
6. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: x = 10 / 2 = 5.
