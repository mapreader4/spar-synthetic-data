Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the amount of money Pop spent be x.

Since Snap spends twice as much as Crackle, then Snap spent 2x the amount Crackle spent.  So, Snap spent 2x the amount Crackle spent.

Crackle spent 3 times as much as Pop, so Crackle spent 3x the amount Pop spent.  So, Crackle spent 3x the amount Pop spent.

We know that Snap and Crackle spent a total of $150, so we can set up an equation:

2x + 3x = 150

We can add x to both sides of the equation to get:

2x + 3x = 150 + x

We can subtract 2x from both sides to get:

x = 150 - 2x

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to get:

x/2 = 75 - x

We can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

x = 75

So, Pop spent $75.
