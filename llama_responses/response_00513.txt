Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that Jennifer has 10 pears and 20 oranges. We are told that she has twice as many apples as pears, so she has 2 * 10 = 20 apples.

So, the total number of fruits she has is 10 + 20 + 20 = 30.

If she gives her sister 2 of each fruit, she will give away 2 pears, 2 oranges, and 2 apples. So, the number of fruits she has left is 30 - 6 = 24.

Answer: 24
