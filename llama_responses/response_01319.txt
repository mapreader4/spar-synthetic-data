Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's find the total cost of the oysters: 3 dozen oysters for $15.00 a dozen is 3 x $15.00 = $45.00.
2. Next, let's find the cost of the shrimp: 2 pounds of shrimp for $14.00 a pound is 2 x $14.00 = $28.00.
3. Next, let's find the cost of the clams: 2 pounds of clams for $13.50 a pound is 2 x $13.50 = $27.00.
4. Now, let's add the total cost of the oysters, shrimp, and clams: $45.00 + $28.00 + $27.00 = $100.00.
5. Finally, since there are 4 people splitting the bill, we need to divide the total cost by 4: $100.00 รท 4 = $25.00.
