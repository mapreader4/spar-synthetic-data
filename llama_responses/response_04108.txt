Let's break this down step by step.

Justin needs to finish his homework and chores before the movie starts at 8 pm. He won't be home until 5 pm, so he has 3 hours before the movie starts.

He needs to spend 45 minutes on dinner, so he can start dinner at 5 pm. This means he'll finish dinner by 5:45 pm.

He then needs to spend 30 minutes on homework, which means he can start his homework at 6:15 pm.

He also needs to clean his room (30 minutes), take out the trash (5 minutes), and empty the dishwasher (10 minutes). These tasks will take a total of 45 minutes, so he can start these tasks at 6:30 pm.

To be done with all his tasks by 8 pm, he needs to start his chores and homework by 6:15 pm - 45 minutes = 5:30 pm.

Answer: 5:30
