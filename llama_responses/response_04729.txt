Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the monkey runs for 5 seconds at a speed of 15 feet per second. To find the distance traveled while running, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance while running = Speed x Time = 15 feet/second x 5 seconds = 75 feet

Next, the monkey swings for 10 seconds at a speed of 10 feet per second. To find the distance traveled while swinging, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance while swinging = Speed x Time = 10 feet/second x 10 seconds = 100 feet

Now, we add the distances traveled while running and swinging to find the total distance traveled:

Total distance = Distance while running + Distance while swinging = 75 feet + 100 feet = 175 feet

Answer: 175
