To find out how many 20 pound bags of dog food Mike needs to buy in a month, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food his dogs eat in a month.

Since each dog eats 6 cups of dog food twice a day, that is 12 cups a day. For 30 days in a month, that is 30 * 12 = 360 cups of dog food. Each bag is 4 pounds, so to find out how many 20 pound bags of dog food he needs, we divide 360 cups by 4, which is 90. Since each bag is 20 pounds, he needs 4.5 bags of dog food.
