Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the cost of the rugs. Mrs. Oaklyn bought 20 rugs at $40 each, so the total cost is:

Cost = 20 x $40 = $800

Now, let's find the selling price. She sells each rug for $60. The total selling price will be:

Revenue = 20 x $60 = $1200

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $1200 - $800 = $400

So, the profit is $400.

Answer: 400
