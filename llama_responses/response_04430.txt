Let's think step by step.

Barbara's goal is to save $100 for the wristwatch. She currently has $20. So, she needs to save an additional amount to reach her goal.

Barbara's weekly allowance is $5, and she has already received 10 weeks' worth of allowance, which is 10 x $5 = $50. So, she has already saved $50.

To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has from her goal: $100 - $20 = $80.

Since she has already saved $50, she needs to save an additional $80 to reach her goal.

Since her weekly allowance is $5, we can divide the remaining amount she needs to save by her weekly allowance: $80 รท $5 = 16.

Answer: 16
