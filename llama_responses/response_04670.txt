Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, the flag is raised to the top of the 60-foot flagpole, which means it has moved 60 feet up.

Then, the flag is lowered to half-mast, which means it has moved halfway down the pole, or 30 feet down. So, the total distance moved so far is:

60 feet up (initially) - 30 feet down (lowered to half-mast) = 30 feet up

Next, the flag is raised back to the top of the pole, which means it has moved 30 feet up again. So, the total distance moved so far is:

30 feet up (initially) + 30 feet up (raised back to top) = 60 feet up

Finally, the flag is completely lowered, which means it has moved 60 feet down. So, the total distance moved over the course of the day is:

60 feet up (initially) + 30 feet up (raised back to top) - 60 feet down (completely lowered) = 30 feet

Answer: 30
