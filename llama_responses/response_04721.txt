Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Let's start by identifying the current age of Carla. According to the problem, in 6 years, Carla will be 30 years old. So, the current age of Carla is 24 years.

Step 2: The sum of the current ages of Carla and Louis is 55. We know that Carla's age is 24, so Louis's age is 55 - 24 = 31.

Answer: 31
