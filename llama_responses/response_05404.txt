Let's break down the information:

Monday: 65 pieces of mail
Tuesday: 10 more than Monday, so 65 + 10 = 75
Wednesday: 5 fewer than Tuesday, so 75 - 5 = 70
Thursday: 15 more than Wednesday, so 70 + 15 = 85

To find the total number of pieces of mail sent, we add up the number of pieces of mail for each day: 65 + 75 + 70 + 85 = 225

Answer: 225
