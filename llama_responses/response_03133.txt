Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total number of oranges produced by each sister.

Gabriela's grove produced 600 oranges per tree, and she has 110 trees, so she produced a total of:

600 x 110 = 66000 oranges

Alba's grove produced 400 oranges per tree, and she has 110 trees, so she produced a total of:

400 x 110 = 44000 oranges

Maricela's grove produced 500 oranges per tree, and she has 110 trees, so she produced a total of:

500 x 110 = 55000 oranges

Now, let's add up the total number of oranges produced by the three sisters:

66000 + 44000 + 55000 = 165000

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups of juice that can be made from the oranges. If it takes 3 medium-sized oranges to make 1 cup of juice, then we can divide the total number of oranges by 3 to get the total number of cups:

165000 รท 3 = 55000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money they will make by selling each cup for $4:

55000 cups x $4 = 220000

Answer: 220000
