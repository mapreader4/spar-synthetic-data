Let's break it down step by step:

1. The show has a debut and 200 people buy tickets. This means that the total number of tickets sold is 200.
2. The second showing has three times as many people, so the total number of people for the second showing is 3 x 200 = 600.
3. The total number of people is the sum of the number of people for the debut and the second showing, which is 200 + 600 = 800.
4. The cost of each ticket is $25, so the total amount of money made by the show is 800 * 25 = 20,000.

Answer: 20000
