Let's start by calculating the number of slices from Danny's watermelon. He brings 3 watermelons and cuts each watermelon into 10 slices, so the total number of slices from his watermelons is 3 x 10 = 30.

His sister brings 1 watermelon and cuts it into 15 slices, so the total number of slices from her watermelon is 15.

To find the total number of watermelon slices, we add the number of slices from Danny's watermelons to the number of slices from his sister's watermelon: 30 + 15 = 45.

Answer: 45
