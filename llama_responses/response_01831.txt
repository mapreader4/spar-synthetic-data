Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of pencils the store ordered. The store ordered 15 boxes, each with 80 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 15 x 80 = 1200 pencils.

Since the store ordered more than twice as many pens as pencils, it means that the store ordered 2 x 1200 = 2400 pens.

The cost of each pen is $5, so the total cost of all the pens would be 2400 x $5 = 12,000.

The cost of each pencil is $4, and the store ordered 15 boxes, each having 80 pencils. The total cost of all the pencils would be 15 x 80 x $4 = 600.

The store paid more than twice as much for pens than pencils. So, the total cost of stationery is 12,000 + 600 = 12,600.

Answer: 12600
