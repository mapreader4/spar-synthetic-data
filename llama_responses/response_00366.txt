Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the length of the ladder Keaton climbed. Keaton climbed the ladder 20 times, so the total length he climbed is 30 feet times 20 = 600 feet.

Next, let's find the length of the ladder Reece climbed. Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, and the ladder is 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder. So, the length of Reece's ladder is 30 - 4 = 26 feet. Reece climbed this ladder 15 times, so the total length Reece climbed is 26 feet times 15 = 390 feet.

The total length of the ladders both workers climbed is the sum of the lengths of the ladders they climbed, which is 600 + 390 = 990 feet.

Answer: 990
