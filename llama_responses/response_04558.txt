Let's break this down step by step.

1. Yves and his siblings ordered pizza and asked to have it cut into 16 slices.
2. During dinner time, they only ate one-fourth of it. So, they ate 4 slices.
3. The next day, Yves ate one-fourth of the remaining pizza. So, he ate 4 slices.
4. His two siblings ate 2 slices each, so they ate 4 slices.
5. To find the total number of slices eaten, we add 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

Answer: 12
