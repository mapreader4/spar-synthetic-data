To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that Josh buys 3 packs of string cheese.
2. Each pack of string cheese has 20 string cheeses.
3. Each string cheese costs 10 cents.
4. So, the total cost of all the string cheese is 3 x (20 x 10) = 60 cents.

Josh pays 60 cents for the string cheese.
