Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by letting x be the value of the middle letter before the word score was tripled. 

The total score of the word is 30 points, and since the word score was tripled, the tripled score is 30 * 3 = 90. 

Before the word score was tripled, the score was x points. 

The first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, so the total value of these two letters is 2 points. 

Since the total score is x points, we can set up an equation: 

x - 2 = 30

To solve for x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation: 

x = 30 + 2

x = 32

So, the value of the middle letter before the word score was tripled is 32. 

Answer: 32
