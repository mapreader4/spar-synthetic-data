Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of twigs needed to make the nest. The bird has already placed 12 twigs, and it needs to weave in 6 more twigs for each of those 12 twigs, so that's a total of 12 x 6 = 72 twigs.

The bird has found a tree that has dropped a third of the twigs it needs, which means it has found 72 / 3 = 24 twigs.

So, the bird still needs 72 - 24 = 48 twigs to finish its nest.
