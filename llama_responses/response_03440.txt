Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The cost of the pasta is 2 kilograms, and it costs $1.5 per kilogram. So, the total cost of the pasta is 2 * $1.5 = $3.

2. The ground beef costs $8 per kilogram. Mica is buying 1/4 kilogram of it, so the cost of the ground beef is 1/4 * $8 = $2.

3. The pasta sauce is 2 jars, and each jar costs $2. The cost of the pasta sauce is 2 * $2 = $4.

4. The Quesadilla costs $6.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

$3 + $2 + $4 + $6 = $11.

Mica has $11.
