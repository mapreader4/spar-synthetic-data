Let's start by identifying the total square footage of the houses before the expansion.

The total square footage of the original houses is the sum of the square footage of the 5,200 sq. ft. house and the 7,300 sq. ft. house.

5,200 + 7,300 = 12,500 sq. ft.

Now, the total square footage after the expansion of the smaller house is 16,000 sq. ft. So, the expansion of the smaller house is the difference between the total square footage after the expansion and the original square footage of the smaller house.

16,000 - 5,200 = 10,800 sq. ft.

So, the smaller house is being expanded by 10,800 sq. ft.

Answer: 10,800
