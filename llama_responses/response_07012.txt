Let's break it down step by step.

Jake earns thrice what Jacob does. This means that Jake earns 3 times the amount Jacob earns.

We know that Jacob earns 6 dollars per hour. So, Jake earns 3 * 6 = 18 dollars per hour.

Since Jake works 8 hours a day, we need to find out how much Jake earns in 5 days.

Jake earns 18 dollars per hour. In 1 day, Jake works 8 hours. So, in 5 days, Jake works 5 * 8 = 40 hours.

Jake earns 18 dollars per hour. In 40 hours, Jake earns 40 * 18 = 720 dollars.

Answer: 720
