To solve this problem, we can start by using the information given that each square meter of the football field requires 3 times as much seed as fertilizer. So, if we let x be the number of gallons of seed used, then the equation to solve for x is:

x = (60 / 3)

We can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 3 to get:

x / 3 = 60 / 3

x / 3 = 20

So, Carson uses 20 gallons of seed.
