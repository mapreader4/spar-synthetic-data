Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The boxer's current weight is 97 kg.
* The boxer wants to lose 3 kg per month.
* The goal is to find the weight of the boxer on the day of the fight.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple subtraction equation:

Current weight (97 kg) - (3 kg/month * 4 months) =?

To find the weight on the day of the fight, we need to subtract the total amount of weight lost from the current weight. Since the boxer wants to lose 3 kg per month, and there are 4 months, the total amount of weight lost is:

3 kg/month * 4 months = 3 kg * 4 = 12 kg

Now, we can subtract this amount from the current weight:

97 kg - 12 kg =?

To find the answer, we perform the subtraction:

97 - 12 = 85

Answer: 85
