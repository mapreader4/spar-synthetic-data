Let's break this problem down step by step.

Victoria received a $50 bill. She bought 2 boxes of pizza that costs $12 each, so that is a total of 2 x 12 = $24. She also bought 2 packs of juice drinks that cost $2 each, so that is a total of 2 x 2 = $4. The total amount she spent is $24 + $4 = $28. So Victoria should return $50 - $28 = $22 to her mother.
