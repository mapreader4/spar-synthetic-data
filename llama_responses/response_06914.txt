Let's break this problem down step by step.

Billy starts with the website generating 15 suggestions. He watches each of the 15 suggestions, one by one, and doesn't like any of them. So, he watches a total of 15 videos.

Since he watches 15 videos and doesn't like any of them, he continues to watch until he finds one he likes. He does this a total of 5 times, which means he watches 5 more videos after the initial 15.

So, in total, Billy watches 15 + 5 = 20 videos.

Answer: 20
