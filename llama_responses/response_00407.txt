Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Eustace is twice as old as Milford. So, if Eustace is x years old, then Milford is x/2 years old.

We are given that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

E + 3 = 39

We can solve for E:

E = 39 - 3
E = 36

So, Eustace is 36 years old. Now, we can find Milford's age in 3 years by multiplying E by 2:

Milford's age in 3 years = E * 2
= 36 * 2
= 72

So, Milford will be 72 years old in 3 years.
