Let's break down the given information step by step:

1. The Drugstore starts with 4500 bottles of hand sanitizer gel.
2. On Monday, 2445 bottles were sold, so the remaining amount is:
4500 - 2445 = 2055 bottles.
3. On Tuesday, 900 bottles were sold, so the remaining amount is:
2055 - 900 = 1155 bottles.
4. 50 bottles were sold each day from Wednesday to Sunday, which is 5 days, so the total number of bottles sold is:
50 x 5 = 250 bottles.
5. The total number of bottles sold so far is:
1155 + 250 = 1405 bottles.
6. The supplier delivers 650 bottles, so the total number of bottles is:
1405 + 650 = 2055 bottles.

The Drugstore has 2055 bottles of hand sanitizer gel at the end of the week.
