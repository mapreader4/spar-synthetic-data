Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cherries Veronica needs to pit. She needs 3 pounds of cherries, and there are 80 cherries in one pound. So, she needs 3 x 80 = 240 cherries.

Next, let's identify how many cherries Veronica can pit in 10 minutes. She can pit 20 cherries in 10 minutes. So, let's find out how many cherries she can pit in 1 minute. 20 cherries in 10 minutes is the same as 2 cherries in 1 minute. So, she can pit 2 cherries in 1 minute.

Now, let's find out how many cherries she can pit in 1 hour. 2 cherries in 1 minute is the same as 12 cherries in 5 minutes. So, she can pit 12 cherries in 5 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many cherries she can pit in 1 hour. 12 cherries in 5 minutes is the same as 24 cherries in 10 minutes. So, she can pit 24 cherries in 10 minutes.

Finally, let's find out how many cherries Veronica needs to pit in total. She needs to pit 240 cherries, and she can pit 24 cherries in 10 minutes. So, she needs 10 sets of 24 cherries, or 240 minutes. 240 minutes is the same as 4 hours.
