Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what we know.

* Alex has some new shirts.
* Joe has 3 more new shirts than Alex.
* Ben has 8 more new shirts than Joe.

So, we know that Ben has 8 more new shirts than Joe, and Joe has 3 more new shirts than Alex. So, we can write an equation to represent the situation:

Alex + 3 = Joe, and Ben = Joe + 8.

We know that Ben has 15 new shirts, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Alex + 3 = Joe = 15, and Joe = Joe + 8.

We can solve for Alex by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

Alex = 15 - 3 = 12.

So, Alex has 12 new shirts.
