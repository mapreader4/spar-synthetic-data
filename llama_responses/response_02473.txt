Let's break this down step by step:

1. Matt can paint the house in 12 hours. 
2. Patty can paint the same house in one third the time, so Patty can paint the house in 12/3 = 4 hours.
3. Rachel can paint the same house in 5 more than double the amount of hours as Patty, so Rachel can paint the house in 4 * 2 = 8 hours + 5 = 13 hours.
