Let's start by using the information that the number of green shoes is equal to the number of purple shoes. So, let's call the number of green shoes x. Then, we know that the total number of shoes is 1250, and the number of blue shoes is 540. So, we can write the equation 540 + x = 1250. To solve for x, we subtract 540 from both sides of the equation, so x = 1250 - 540. This means x = 710. So, there are 710 pairs of purple shoes in the warehouse.

Answer: 710
