Let's break down the information step by step.

We know that the total earnings are $380.
We know that the earnings from broccoli are $57.
We know that the earnings from carrots are twice as much as the earnings from broccoli, so the earnings from carrots are 2 x $57 = $114.

Now, let's find the earnings from spinach. The earnings from spinach are $16 more than half of the earnings from carrots. Half of the earnings from carrots is $114 / 2 = $57. Then, the earnings from spinach are $57 + $16 = $73.

So far, we have the following earnings:

* Broccoli: $57
* Carrots: $114
* Spinach: $73

The total earnings are $380, and we have accounted for $57 + $114 + $73 = $244 of those earnings. To find the earnings from cauliflower, we subtract the earnings we have accounted for from the total earnings:

$380 - $244 = $136
