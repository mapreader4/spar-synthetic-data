Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total number of pages turned in by the 15 students. We know that the first 5 students turned in 2 pages each, so that is 5 * 2 = 10 pages. The next 5 students turned in 3 pages each, so that is 5 * 3 = 15 pages. The last 5 students turned in 1 page each, so that is 5 * 1 = 5 pages. To find the total number of pages turned in, we add 10 + 15 + 5 = 30 pages.

To find the average page count per student, we divide the total number of pages by the total number of students. The average is 30 รท 15 = 2. Answer: 2
