Let's start by identifying the information given: 

1. Stan weighs 5 pounds more than Steve.
2. Steve is 8 pounds lighter than Jim.
3. Jim weighs 110 pounds.

We can start by using the second statement to find the weight of Steve. Since Steve is 8 pounds lighter than Jim, and Jim weighs 110 pounds, Steve must weigh 110 - 8 = 102 pounds.

Now, we know that Stan weighs 5 pounds more than Steve. So, Stan's weight is 102 + 5 = 107 pounds.

The total weight of the three of them is the sum of their individual weights: 110 (Jim) + 102 (Steve) + 107 (Stan) = 319 pounds.

Answer: 319
