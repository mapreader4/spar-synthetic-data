Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with what we know:

* Natasha has 3 times as much money as Carla.
* Carla has twice as much money as Cosima.
* Natasha has $60.

We can use the information to write an equation to find how much money Cosima has.

Natasha has 3 times as much money as Carla, so if we let C be the amount of money Cosima has, we can write:

C = Natasha's money / 3

We know that Natasha has $60, so we can substitute this into the equation:

60 / 3 = C

This means C is 20.

So Cosima has $20.

Now we know the amount of money each person has. We can use this information to find the total amount of money they have together:

Natasha has $60, Carla has $20, and Cosima has $20. The total amount of money they have is:

60 + 20 + 20 = 100

They have $100.

Now that we know the total amount of money they have, we can find the profit they will make by selling the goods at 7/5 of the buying price.

They will buy the goods at 7/5 of the buying price, which is:

100 x 7/5 = 140

They will sell the goods at 7/5 of the buying price, which is 140, and they will make a profit of:

140 - 100 = 40

They will make a profit of $40.

Answer: 40
