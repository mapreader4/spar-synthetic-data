Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of fish-eater birds Cohen saw on the first day is x.

On the second day, the number of fish-eater birds doubled. So, the number of fish-eater birds Cohen saw on the second day is 2x.

On the third day, the number of fish-eater birds reduced by 200. So, the number of fish-eater birds Cohen saw on the third day is 2x - 200.

We know that the total number of fish-eater birds Cohen saw is the sum of the number of fish-eater birds on the first day, the second day, and the third day. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x - 200 = 300 + 300

We can solve this equation by adding 300 to both sides:

x + 2x - 200 = 300 + 300

x + 2x = 600 - 200

x + 2x = 400

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 400 / 2

x = 200

So, the answer is 200.

Answer: 200
