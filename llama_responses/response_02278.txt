Let's break this down step by step.

Johnny can walk 3 dogs at a time. Since he has 6 dogs that need 60-minute walks, he will need to make 2 trips to walk all the dogs, since 6 / 3 = 2.

Each 60-minute walk is worth $20, so Johnny makes 2 x $20 = $40 from the 60-minute walks.

Johnny works for 4 hours per day, and he only has 60-minute walks, so he can only do 2 walks per day. This means he works for 2 hours per day. Since he works 5 days, he works for 2 x 5 = 10 hours in total.

Johnny makes $40 from the 60-minute walks and $15 from the 30-minute walks. Since he works 10 hours, he will have 10 / 2 = 5 30-minute walks. He makes $15 for each 30-minute walk, so he makes 5 x $15 = $75 from the 30-minute walks.

Johnny's total earnings are $40 from the 60-minute walks and $75 from the 30-minute walks, so his total earnings are $40 + $75 = $115.
