Let's break this down step by step.

Hillary sells 3 crafts at 12 dollars each, so she earns 3 x 12 = 36 dollars. She is given an extra 7 dollars, so she has a total of 36 + 7 = 43 dollars. Then, she deposits 18 dollars into her bank account. To find out how many dollars Hillary has left, we need to subtract the 18 dollars she deposited from the 43 dollars she had. 43 - 18 = 25.

Answer: 25
