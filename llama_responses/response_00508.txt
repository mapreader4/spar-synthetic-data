Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the distance he drives in the first 30 minutes. Since James drives at a speed of 30 mph, the distance is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

Then, he drives at twice the speed, which is 60 mph, for twice the time, which is 1 hour. The distance is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 1 hour = 60 miles.

The total distance he drives is the sum of these two distances. So, the total distance is:

15 miles + 60 miles = 75 miles.

Answer: 75
