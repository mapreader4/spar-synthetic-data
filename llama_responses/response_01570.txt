Let's break down Holly's chocolate milk consumption step by step:

1. She starts the day with an unknown amount of chocolate milk.
2. She drinks 8 ounces of chocolate milk with her breakfast.
3. Then, she buys a new 64-ounce container of chocolate milk and drinks 8 ounces of it, leaving her with 56 ounces remaining.
4. She drinks another 8 ounces of chocolate milk with her dinner.
5. At the end of the day, she has 56 ounces of chocolate milk left.

Now, let's use the information to find out how many ounces of chocolate milk she began the day with:

Let x be the number of ounces of chocolate milk Holly started with.

After drinking 8 ounces with breakfast, she had x - 8 ounces left.

After drinking 8 ounces from the new container, she had (x - 8) - 8 ounces left.

After drinking 8 ounces with dinner, she had 56 ounces left.

So, we can set up the equation:

x - 8 - 8 - 8 = 56

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 24 = 56

Adding 24 to both sides, we get:

x = 80

Answer: 80
