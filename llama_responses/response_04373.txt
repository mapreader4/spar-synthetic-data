Let's break this problem down step by step.

Lucille started with a total of 11 + 14 + 32 = 57 weeds to pull.

She pulled weeds from the flower bed, the vegetable patch, and half of the grass. Since there are 32 weeds in the grass, half of that is 32 รท 2 = 16. So, she pulled weeds from 11 + 14 + 16 = 41 weeds.

She earned 6 cents for each weed, so she earned 41 x 6 = 246 cents.

She spent 99 cents on a soda, so she has 246 - 99 = 147 cents left.

Answer: 147
