Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Lisa's hourly wage is x. Since Greta worked 40 hours and earned $12 per hour, her total earnings would be:

40 hours * $12 per hour = 40 * 12 = $480

Now, let's say Lisa wants to earn the same amount as Greta. So, we set up an equation:

40 * x = 480

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 40:

x = 480 / 40
x = 12

So, Lisa would have to work 12 hours to equal Greta's earnings for 40 hours.
