Let's break down the information given:

* First expedition: 3 weeks
* Second expedition: 3 + 2 = 5 weeks
* Last expedition: 5 * 2 = 10 weeks

The total number of weeks they spent on the island is the sum of the weeks spent on each expedition: 3 + 5 + 10 = 18 weeks.

To convert this to days, we multiply the total number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): 18 * 7 = 126 days.

Answer: 126
