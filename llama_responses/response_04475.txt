Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total distance traveled by adding the distances together:

12 miles (Monday) + 18 miles (Tuesday) + 21 miles (Wednesday) = 51 miles

Next, we need to find the average distance traveled per day by dividing the total distance by the number of days:

51 miles (total distance) รท 3 (number of days) = 17 miles/day

So, the average distance traveled per day is 17 miles.
