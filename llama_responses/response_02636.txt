Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: 

- Charlize was 20 minutes late.
- Four of her classmates were each 10 minutes late than she was.

Since Charlize was 20 minutes late, we know that her classmates were late by 20 + 4 * 10 = 60 minutes. 

So, the total time for which the five students were late is 20 + 60 = 80 minutes. 

Answer: 80
