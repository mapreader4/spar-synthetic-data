Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the cupcakes and cookies:

* Cupcakes: 3.00 dollars, reduced by half = 3.00 / 2 = 1.50
* Cookies: 2.00 dollars, reduced by half = 2.00 / 2 = 1.00

So, the cost of the remaining cupcakes and cookies is:

1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50

Now, let's find out how much money she made from selling the last 16 cupcakes and 8 cookies:

Cupcakes: 16 * 0.50 = 8.00
Cookies: 8 * 0.50 = 4.00

Total amount of money made = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00

Answer: 12
