Let's start by identifying the total cost of the math and science books:

The math books cost 2 x $3 = $6. The science books cost 6 x $3 = $18. The total cost of the math and science books is $6 + $18 = $24.

The art books cost $x. The total cost of all the books is $30. So, the cost of the art books must be $30 - $24 = $6.
