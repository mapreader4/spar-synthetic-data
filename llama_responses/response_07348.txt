Let's break this down step by step.

Yesterday, Amy biked 12 miles. If she biked 3 miles less than twice as far as yesterday, that means she biked 12 - 2 * 3 = 12 - 6 = 6 miles less than yesterday. So, she biked 6 miles yesterday.

So, the total distance she biked in the two days is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.
