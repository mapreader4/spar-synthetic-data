Let's break this problem down step by step.

Cindy can jump rope for 12 minutes before tripping up on the ropes.
Betsy can jump rope half as long as Cindy, which is 12/2 = 6 minutes.
Tina can jump rope three times as long as Betsy, which is 3 * 6 = 18 minutes.

To find out how many more minutes Tina can jump rope than Cindy, we subtract Cindy's jumping time from Tina's jumping time: 18 - 12 = 6.

Answer: 6
