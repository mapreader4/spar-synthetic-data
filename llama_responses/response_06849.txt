Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the time it takes Mobius to travel from Florence to Rome while carrying a typical load. She travels at a top speed of 11 miles per hour, and the distance is 143 miles. To find the time, we can divide the distance by the speed:

143 miles / 11 miles/hour = 13 hours

Since Mobius takes two 30-minute rest stops during this half of the trip, we need to add 1 hour to the total time:

13 hours + 1 hour = 14 hours

Now, let's find the time it takes Mobius to travel from Rome back to Florence without carrying a load. She travels at a top speed of 13 miles per hour, and the distance is the same as before, 143 miles. Again, we can divide the distance by the speed:

143 miles / 13 miles/hour = 11 hours

Since Mobius takes two 30-minute rest stops during this half of the trip, we need to add 1 hour to the total time:

11 hours + 1 hour = 12 hours

Finally, we can add the time it takes to travel from Florence to Rome and from Rome back to Florence to find the total time for the trip:

14 hours + 12 hours = 26 hours

Answer: 26
