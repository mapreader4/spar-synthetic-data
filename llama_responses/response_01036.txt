Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "Alia has 2 times as many markers as Austin. Austin has one-third as many markers as Steve does."

So, we know that Austin has 1/3 of Steve's markers. We can write this as an equation: Austin = 1/3 * Steve's markers.

We are also told that Steve has 60 markers. So, we can substitute Steve's markers into the equation: Austin = 1/3 * 60.

To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get: Austin = 20.

So, Alia has 2 times as many markers as Austin. So, we can multiply 20 by 2: Alia = 40.

Answer: 40
