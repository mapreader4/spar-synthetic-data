Let's break down the cost of the items Jackie bought:

* 1 shampoo and conditioner: 2 x $10.00 = $20.00
* 3 bottles of lotion: 3 x $6.00 = $18.00

Total cost of the items = $20.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

To be eligible for free shipping, Jackie needs to spend more than $50.00.  So, the amount Jackie needs to spend is:

$50.00 - $38.00 = $12.00
