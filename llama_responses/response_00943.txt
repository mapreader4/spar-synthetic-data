Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how much money Javier needs to make from selling donuts to reach his goal of $96.

Javier wants to make $96, and he sells each donut for $1. To find out how many donuts he needs to sell, we can divide his goal by the price per donut:

$96 รท $1 = 96 donuts

Since Javier buys donuts in dozens, he buys them for $2.40 per dozen. To find out how many dozens he needs, we can divide the total number of donuts by 12:

96 รท 12 = 8 dozen

So, Javier needs to buy 8 dozens of donuts.
