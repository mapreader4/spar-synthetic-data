Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the tickets if Violet buys separate tickets.

1 adult ticket: $35
6 children's tickets: 6 x $20 = $120

Total cost of separate tickets: $35 + $120 = $155

Step 2: Determine the cost of the family pass.

Family pass: $120

Step 3: Compare the cost of the separate tickets to the cost of the family pass.

Cost of separate tickets: $155
Cost of family pass: $120

Conclusion:
Violet should buy the family pass because it is cheaper, by $35.
