Let's break this down step by step:

1. The full-size Mustang is 240 inches long.
2. The mid-size model is 1/10th the size of the full-size model, so the mid-size model is 240 / 10 = 24 inches long.
3. The smallest model is half the size of the mid-size model, so the smallest model is half of 24 inches, which is 12 inches.

Answer: 12
