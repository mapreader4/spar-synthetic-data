Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first calculate the total amount needed for the down payment. The total amount needed is 108,000 dollars. Let's divide this by 3 to get the amount each person needs to save each month.

108,000 / 3 = 36,000

Now, let's calculate the number of months it will take to save this amount. 

36,000 / 12 = 3,000

So, it will take Richard and Sarah 36 months, or 3 years, to save enough for the down payment on the house.

Now, to find out how much each person needs to save each month, we need to divide the total amount by 12 (36,000 / 12 = 3,000) by 2.

3,000 / 2 = 1,500

So, Richard and Sarah need to save 1,500 each month.

Answer: 1500
