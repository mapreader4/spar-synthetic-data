Let's break this down step by step.

1. It takes Marcus 20 minutes to saute the onions.
2. It takes Marcus a quarter of the time it takes to saute the onions to saute the garlic and peppers. So, it takes Marcus 20/4 = 5 minutes to saute the garlic and peppers.
3. It takes Marcus 30 minutes to knead the dough.
4. It takes Marcus twice as long to let it rest, so it takes Marcus 2 x 30 = 60 minutes to let it rest.
5. It takes Marcus 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. The combined time is 30 + 60 = 90 minutes, so it takes Marcus 1/10th of that to assemble the calzones. 90/10 = 9 minutes.

So, the total time is 20 + 5 + 30 + 60 + 9 = 135 minutes.

Answer: 135
