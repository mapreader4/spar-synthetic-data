Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Djibo's sister's age 5 years ago was x.

Djibo is 17 years old now, so 5 years ago, he was 17 - 5 = 12 years old.

The problem states that 5 years ago, Djibo added his age with his sister's age and the sum was 35. So, we can set up an equation:

12 + x = 35

To solve for x, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

x = 35 - 12
x = 23

So, Djibo's sister is 23 years old today.
