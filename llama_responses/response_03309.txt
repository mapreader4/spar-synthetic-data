Denver uses 7 pieces of wood for each birdhouse, so for 2 birdhouses, he will need 14 pieces of wood. Each piece of wood costs $1.50, so for 14 pieces of wood, he will need 14 x $1.50 = $21.00. The profit per birdhouse is $5.50, so the total cost for 2 birdhouses is 2 x $5.50 = $11.00. So, Denver will charge Danny $11.00.
