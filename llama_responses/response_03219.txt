Let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the patio table and 4 chairs is $135.
2. The patio table cost $55.
3. The cost of each chair is the total cost minus the cost of the patio table. Let's subtract $55 from $135 to get the cost of the 4 chairs.

$135 - $55 = $80

4. Since there are 4 chairs, we can divide the cost of the chairs by 4 to find the cost of each chair.

$80 รท 4 = $20

Answer: 20
