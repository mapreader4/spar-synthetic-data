Let's break it down step by step:

Sam spends 60 minutes studying Science. This is the first part of the time. Next, he spends 80 minutes studying Math. This is the second part of the time. Then, he spends 40 minutes studying Literature. This is the third and final part of the time.

To find the total time spent, we add the three parts together: 60 + 80 + 40 = 180. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3. So, Sam spends 3 hours studying the three subjects.
