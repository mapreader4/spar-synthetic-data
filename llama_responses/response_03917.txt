Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, Jack had to wait 20 hours in customs. Then, he had to wait 14 days in coronavirus quarantine.

To find the total hours, we need to convert the 14 days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so we can multiply 14 days by 24 hours to get the total hours:

14 days * 24 hours = 336 hours

Adding the 20 hours in customs, we get:

20 hours + 336 hours = 336 + 20 = 356 hours

So, Jack had a total of 356 hours to wait.
