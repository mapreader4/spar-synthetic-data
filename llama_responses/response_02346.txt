Let's break it down step by step.

John's old system cost 250 dollars. He got 80% of its value. So, 0.8 * 250 = 200. He got 200 dollars for his old system.

Then he bought a new system that costs 600 dollars, but he got a 25% discount. So, 0.25 * 600 = 150. So he paid 150 dollars for the new system.

So, John's out-of-pocket expense is 200 - 150 = 50. He paid 50 dollars.
