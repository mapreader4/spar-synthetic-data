Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie worked for 2 hours a day for 4 days. So, the total hours she worked is 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

She was paid $22 an hour. So, her total earnings are 8 * 22 = $176.

The cost for supplies was $54. So, the total cost is $54.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the earnings. Profit = Earnings - Cost = 176 - 54 = $122.

Answer: 122
