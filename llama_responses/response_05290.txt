Let's break down the information given:

1/4 of the 400 emails are spam emails, which is equal to 100 emails.
2/5 of the remaining emails are promotional messages, which is equal to 160 emails.
The remaining emails are the important emails.

We can find the number of important emails by subtracting the spam and promotional emails from the total number of emails:

400 - 100 (spam) - 160 (promotional) = 140

So, the total number of important emails in her inbox is 140.

Answer: 140
