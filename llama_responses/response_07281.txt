Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's first find out how many minutes Sean played cricket in total. Since Sean played 50 minutes each day for 14 days, we can multiply 50 x 14 to get the total minutes Sean played: 50 x 14 = 700 minutes.
2. Now, we know that Sean and Indira played cricket for a total of 1512 minutes. Since we know Sean played 700 minutes, that means Indira played 1512 - 700 = 812 minutes.
3. So, Indira played 812 minutes of cricket.
