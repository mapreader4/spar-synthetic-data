Let's break this problem down step by step.

There are 50 rows of purple beads with 20 beads per row, so there are a total of 50 * 20 = 1000 purple beads. There are 40 rows of blue beads with 18 beads per row, so there are a total of 40 * 18 = 720 blue beads. There are 80 rows of gold beads, with 80 beads per row, so there are a total of 80 * 80 = 640 gold beads.

The total number of beads is 1000 + 720 + 640 = 2360 beads.

Each bead costs $1 per 10 beads, so the total cost is 2360 / 10 = 236 beads.
