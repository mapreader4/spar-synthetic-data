Let's break this problem down step by step.

Jay invited 22 people, and Gloria invited 36 people, so in total, there will be 22 + 36 = 58 guests at the party.

They want each guest to have a flag, so they will need 58 flags. They also want Jay and Gloria to have a flag each, so they will need 58 + 2 = 60 flags in total.

The flags are 5 for $1.00 each, so the total cost will be 60 * 1.00 = 60.00.

Answer: 60
