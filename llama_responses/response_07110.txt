Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Jack can carry 2 buckets at a time, but Jill can only carry 1 bucket at a time. So, Jack will make 3 trips and Jill will make 2 trips. So, the total number of trips is 5 (3 + 2 = 5).

2. Each bucket is 5 gallons. So, the total gallons carried by Jack is 10 (3 x 2 = 10), and the total gallons carried by Jill is 5 (2 x 1 = 5).

3. The total gallons carried is 15. 600 gallons are needed to fill the tank. 600 - 15 = 585 gallons remain. 585 gallons are left to be carried.

4. The answer is 59 trips.
