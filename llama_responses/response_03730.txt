Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many hours Peter can read a book. We know that Peter can read a book in 18 hours, so the rate of reading is 18 hours per book. Since Peter can read 3 times as fast as Kristin, Kristin's rate of reading is 24 hours per book. So, Kristin can read a book in 24 hours.

Now, Kristin has to read 20 books. To find out how many hours it will take Kristin to read half of her books, we need to find half of 20, which is 10 books. Since Kristin can read a book in 24 hours, she can read 10 books in 240 hours. Therefore, it will take Kristin 240 hours to read 10 books.
