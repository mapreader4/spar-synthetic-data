Let's break this problem down step by step.

Tom currently gets 5 hours of sleep each weeknight and 6 hours each night on the weekend. This means he gets a total of:

* 5 hours * 7 nights = 35 hours of sleep per week (weeknights)
* 6 hours * 2 nights = 12 hours of sleep per weekend (weekend)
* Total sleep hours per week = 35 + 12 = 47 hours

Tom would ideally like to get 8 hours of sleep each night on both weeknights and weekends. This means he would like to get a total of:

* 8 hours * 7 nights = 56 hours of sleep per week (weeknights)
* 8 hours * 2 nights = 16 hours of sleep per weekend (weekend)
* Total sleep hours per week = 56 + 16 = 72 hours

To find out how many hours Tom is behind, we subtract the total sleep hours he currently gets from the total sleep hours he would ideally like to get:

* 72 (ideal sleep hours) - 47 (current sleep hours) = 25 hours

Answer: 25
