Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the given information:

1. The size of Holden's current master bedroom is 309 sq ft.
2. The size of his master bath is 150 sq ft.
3. He wants to add a home office/personal gym divided space that is twice as large as his bedroom.

To find the size of the new room, we need to multiply the size of the bedroom by 2, since it's twice as large as the bedroom. So, we have:

309 sq ft (bedroom) * 2 = 618 sq ft

So, the size of the new room will be 618 sq ft.
