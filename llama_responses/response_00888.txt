Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with Teddy, who has 7 dogs and 8 cats.

Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy, so Ben has 7 + 9 = 16 dogs.

Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy, so Dave has 8 + 13 = 21 cats. Dave has 5 less dogs than Teddy, so Dave has 7 - 5 = 2 dogs.

Now, let's add the number of pets for all of them:

Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats, so that's a total of 7 + 8 = 15 pets.
Ben has 16 dogs and 0 cats, so that's a total of 16 pets.
Dave has 2 dogs and 21 cats, so that's a total of 2 + 21 = 23 pets.

Now, let's add the total number of pets:

15 + 16 + 23 = 34.

Answer: 34
