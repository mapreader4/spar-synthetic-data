Let's start by finding the total number of pies Erica took. She took 1/5 of an apple pie and 3/4 of a cherry pie, so we can set up an equation to represent the total number of pies:

1/5 + 3/4 = x

To simplify this equation, we can find the common denominator of the two fractions:

20/20 + 15/20 = x

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 20:

1/1 + 3/4 = 20/20

So, Erica took 20/20 of a whole pie. To express this as a percentage, we can convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator:

20/20 = 1

So, the answer is:
