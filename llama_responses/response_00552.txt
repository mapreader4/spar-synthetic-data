Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the area of the parking lot.

The area of the parking lot is 400 feet by 500 feet.  Multiplying these two numbers together gives us:

400 * 500 = 200,000 square feet

Since 80% of this area is useable for parking, we can find the number of square feet available for parking by multiplying 200,000 by 0.8:

200,000 * 0.8 = 160,000 square feet

Now, we know it takes 10 square feet to park a car.  To find the number of cars that can be parked, we can divide the number of square feet by 10:

160,000 รท 10 = 16,000

So, the answer is:

Answer: 16,000
