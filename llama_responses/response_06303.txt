Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of marbles that are not dark blue. We know that this number is equal to 1/3 of the total number of marbles, which is 63. So, let's call this number x.

We know that the number of red marbles is equal to the total number of marbles minus the number of dark blue marbles. So, we can write an equation:

x = 63 - x/3

Now, we know that the number of green marbles is 4. So, we can substitute this into the equation:

x - x/3 = 4

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 63 - 4 / 3

x = 19

So, the number of red marbles is 19.
