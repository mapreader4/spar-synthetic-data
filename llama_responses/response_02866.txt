Erin is watching a TV mini series of Pride and Prejudice. There are 6 episodes that are each 50 minutes long. To find the total number of minutes, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

6 episodes * 50 minutes = 300 minutes

To convert the total number of minutes to hours, we divide the total number of minutes by 60:

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

So, Erin will spend 5 hours watching the series.
