Let's start by calculating the cost of building the house. The cost of building the house is 100,000 more than the cost of each of the houses in the area. So, the cost of building the house is 320,000.

Then, the house sells for 1.5 times as much as the other houses, which sell at 320,000. So, the selling price of the house is 480,000.

The cost of building the house is 320,000. The selling price of the house is 480,000. So, the difference between the cost and the selling price is 160,000.

So, the profit is 160,000.

Answer: 160,000
