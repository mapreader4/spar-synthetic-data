To find the number of kilograms of sugar sold each week, we need to convert the 20 packets of sugar into kilograms. Each packet of sugar is 100 grams, so 20 packets of sugar is 20 x 100 = 2000 grams. To convert this to kilograms, we divide 2000 by 1000, which gives us 2. So the store sells 2 kilograms of sugar every week.
