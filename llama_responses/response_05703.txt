Let's break down the information given:

* Frank wants to make $50.
* He sells each hamburger for $5.
* 2 people purchased 4 hamburgers, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 hamburgers.
* Another 2 customers purchased 2 hamburgers, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 hamburgers.

Total hamburgers sold so far is 8 + 4 = 12.
To make $50, Frank needs to sell hamburgers at $5 each. So, he needs to sell 50 / 5 hamburgers = 10 more hamburgers.

Answer: 10
