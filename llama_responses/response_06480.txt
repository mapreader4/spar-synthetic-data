Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Hannah has 40 mugs in 4 different colors.
* She has 3 times more blue mugs than red mugs.
* She has 12 yellow mugs.
* She has half as many red mugs as yellow mugs.

Let's start by identifying the number of red mugs. Since she has 12 yellow mugs, and she has half as many red mugs, then she must have 12/2 = 6 red mugs.

Now, she has 3 times more blue mugs than red mugs, so the number of blue mugs is 6 + 3 = 9.

The number of red mugs and blue mugs combined is 6 + 9 = 15. Since there are 4 colors in total, and we've accounted for 15 mugs, the number of mugs of another color must be 40 - 15 = 25.

Answer: 25
