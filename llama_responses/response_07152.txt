Let's start by identifying the number of pieces of red sea glass found by Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy.

Blanche found 3 pieces of red sea glass, and Rose found 9 pieces of red sea glass. Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose combined, which is 3 + 9 = 12 pieces of red sea glass.

Now, let's identify the number of pieces of blue sea glass found by Rose and Dorothy.

Rose found 11 pieces of blue sea glass, and Dorothy found three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, which is 11 x 3 = 33 pieces of blue sea glass.

Now, we can conclude that Dorothy found a total of 12 + 33 = 45 pieces of sea glass.

Answer: 45
