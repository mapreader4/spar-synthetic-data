Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The fuel tank was full on November 1, 2005, containing 3,000 L.
2. On January 1, 2006, the tank counter indicated that 180 L remained. This means that 3,000 - 180 = 2,820 L were used between November 1, 2005, and January 1, 2006.
3. Mr. Fortchaud filled his tank completely on January 1, 2006, so the tank now contains 3,000 L again.
4. On May 1, 2006, Mr. Fortchaud read 1,238 L on the meter. This means that 3,000 - 1,238 = 1,762 L were used between January 1, 2006, and May 1, 2006.

To find the total volume of fuel oil used between November 1, 2005, and May 1, 2006, we add the amount used in step 2 and step 4:

2,820 L (used between November 1, 2005, and January 1, 2006) + 1,762 L (used between January 1, 2006, and May 1, 2006) = 4,582 L

Answer: 4582
