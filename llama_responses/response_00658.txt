Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the price of the computer at the first store. The price is 950, and with a 6% discount, the discounted price is:

950 - (6/100 * 950) = 950 - 57 = 893

Now, let's find the price of the computer at the second store. The price is 920, and with a 5% discount, the discounted price is:

920 - (5/100 * 920) = 920 - 46 = 874

Now, let's find the difference in price between the two stores:

874 - 893 = 19

Answer: 19
