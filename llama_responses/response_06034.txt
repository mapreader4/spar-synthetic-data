Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Brenden caught 8 fish in the morning. He threw back 3 of them. This means that Brenden threw back 3 fish that were too small. This leaves Brenden with 8 - 3 = 5 fish in the morning.

Step 2: Brenden caught 5 more fish in the afternoon. This adds to the 5 fish he had in the morning, so he now has a total of 5 + 5 = 10 fish.

Step 3: Brenden's dad caught 13 fish. This is an additional catch that needs to be added to the total.

Step 4: Brenden's dad's catch is added to Brenden's total. So, we have 10 (Brenden's morning and afternoon catch) + 13 (Brendan's dad's catch) = 23 fish.

Answer: 23
