Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Kyle has x marbles. Then, Fabian has 15 marbles, which is 3 times more than Kyle, so we can set up the equation: 15 = x + 3x. We can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get x = 12.

Now, Miles has 5 times more marbles than Kyle, so we know that Miles has 5x marbles. Since Kyle has x marbles, Miles has 5x - x marbles.

Kyle and Miles have marbles together. We can add their marbles together to get 5x - x + x = 5x - 12. We can combine the like terms by combining the 5 and the -1, so we get 5x - 12 = 3x - 12.

So, Kyle and Miles have 3x - 12 marbles together.
