Let's start by letting e be the number of candies Emily bought. Then, Jennifer bought 2e candies. Bob bought 3 times more than Emily, so Bob bought 3e candies. But we know that Jennifer bought twice as many as Emily, so Jennifer bought 2e candies. We know that the total number of candies bought by Jennifer and Bob is 2e + 3e = 5e. But we are told that Jennifer bought 6 candies, so 2e = 6. So e = 3. So Bob bought 3 * 3 = 9 candies. Answer: 9.
