Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding how many pounds of food John needs in 60 days.

John feeds each horse 2 times a day.  In 60 days, he will feed each horse 2 x 60 times, since 60 is the number of days in 60 days.  That's a total of 120 times. 120 times 20 pounds of food is needed.

John buys half ton bags of food, so we need to find how many half tons of food he needs.

1 half ton is 2000 pounds of food.  120 times 20 pounds is 2400 pounds.  We need to find how many half tons of food that is 2400 pounds of food.

2400 pounds is 12 half tons.  John will have to buy 12 half tons of food.
