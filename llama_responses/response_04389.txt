Let's break down the problem into smaller parts. Let's first find the monthly payment for the house. The house costs $480,000. The loan will be paid over 20 years, so to find the monthly payment, we can divide the total cost by the number of years.

$480,000 รท 20 = $24,000

So the monthly payment for the house is $24,000 per year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the monthly payment by dividing the yearly payment by 12.

$24,000 รท 12 = $2,000

So the monthly payment for the house is $2,000.

Now, let's do the same for the trailer. The trailer costs $120,000. The loan will be paid over 20 years, so we can find the monthly payment the same way as before.

$120,000 รท 20 = $6,000

The monthly payment for the trailer is $6,000. To find the difference in monthly payments, we subtract the trailer's monthly payment from the house's monthly payment.

$2,000 - $6,000 = $1,000

So the monthly payment for the house is $1,000 more than the monthly payment for the trailer.
