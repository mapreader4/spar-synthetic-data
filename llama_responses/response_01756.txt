To find the total amount Madeline needs to earn, we can add up the rent, groceries, medical expenses, and utilities, and the emergency fund.

Madeline needs $1200 + $400 + $200 + $60 + $200 = $1900

She makes $15 per hour. So, to find the number of hours she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage.

$1900 / $15 = 126.67

Madeline needs to work 127 hours.
