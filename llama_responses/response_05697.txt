Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many slices of bread Neeley had initially.

Neeley bought a loaf of bread and sliced it into 12 pieces. So, Neeley has 12 slices of bread initially.

Then, his family ate a third of the bread slices for breakfast. A third of 12 is 4, so they ate 4 slices of bread.

Then, Neeley used 2 bread slices to make a sandwich for lunch.

To find out how many slices of bread remain, we subtract the slices eaten and used from the initial amount of 12 slices.

12 - 4 (eaten) - 2 (used for sandwich) = 6

So, Neeley has 6 slices of bread left.
