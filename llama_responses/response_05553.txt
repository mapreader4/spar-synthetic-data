Let's break this problem down step by step.

If the spider can catch 9 flies in 5 hours, that means that the spider catches 9 / 5 = 1.8 flies per hour.

If the spider keeps this efficiency, it will catch the same number of flies in 30 hours. So, the total number of flies it would catch in 30 hours is 1.8 * 30 = 54 flies.

Answer: 54
