Let's break this problem down step by step.

Tina knows her assignment will only take 10 minutes to complete. She also knows that it will take 3 minutes to clean one key. She has 14 keys left to clean, so the total time it will take to clean the remaining keys is:

14 keys * 3 minutes per key = 42 minutes

Adding the time it takes to complete the assignment to the time it takes to clean the remaining keys, we get:

10 minutes (assignment) + 42 minutes (cleaning) = 52 minutes

So, it will take Tina a total of 52 minutes to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment.

Answer: 52
