Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the initial amount of money Blake gave to Connie is x.

When Connie used the money to buy the land, the value of the land tripled. So, the value of the land is now 3x.

Connie sold the land and got some money. Let's call this amount y.

Connie gave half of the money she got from the sale of the land to Blake. So, she gave Blake y/2.

We know that Connie gave Blake $30,000. So, we can set up an equation:

y/2 = 30000

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 2:

y = 60000

Since Connie gave Blake 30,000, we know that x = 30,000.

Answer: 30000
