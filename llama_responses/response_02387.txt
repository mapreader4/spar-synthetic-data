Let's break this problem down step by step.

Dirk sells 25 amulets each day, so in 2 days, he sells 25 x 2 = 50 amulets.

Each amulet sells for 40 dollars, so the total revenue is 50 x 40 = 2000 dollars.

The cost to make each amulet is 30 dollars, so the total cost is 50 x 30 = 1500 dollars.

The revenue is 2000, and the cost is 1500, so the profit is 2000 - 1500 = 500 dollars.

Dirk has to give 10% of his revenue to the faire, which is 10% of 2000 = 200 dollars. So, his net profit is 500 - 200 = 300 dollars.

Answer: 300
