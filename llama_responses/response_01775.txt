Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the first student counted x squirrels. Then, the second student counted x + 3 squirrels. We know that the second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student, so we know that x + 3 < x. We can solve for x, which is the number of squirrels the first student counted.

x = x + 3 - 12 = 3

So, the first student counted 9 squirrels.

To find the total number of squirrels counted by both students, we can add the number of squirrels counted by each student:

9 + 12 = 21

Answer: 21
