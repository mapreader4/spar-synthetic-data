Let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 45 total problems.
2. There are twice as many multiple choice problems as free response problems.  So, the number of multiple choice problems is 45 / 2 = 22.5.  Since you can't have half of a problem, this is not the correct answer.
3. There are 7 more free response problems than true/false problems.  This means that the number of true/false problems is 7 less than the number of free response problems.  So, the number of true/false problems is 45 - 7 = 38.
4. Therefore, the number of true/false questions is 38.

Answer: 38
