Let's start by identifying the number of towels each person can fold in a certain time. Let's call the number of towels Jane can fold in 5 minutes as J, the number of towels Kyla can fold in 10 minutes as K, and the number of towels Anthony can fold in 20 minutes as A.

We are given that Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes, so we can write the equation:

J = 3 towels / 5 minutes = 0.6 towels per minute.

Similarly, we know that K can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, so we can write the equation:

K = 5 towels / 10 minutes = 0.5 towels per minute.

And we know that A can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes, so we can write the equation:

A = 7 towels / 20 minutes = 0.35 towels per minute.

Now, we need to find the total number of towels they can fold in one hour. Since they can fold towels at a rate of J, K, and A, we can write the equation:

Total towels = J * 60 minutes + K * 6 minutes + A * 3.3 minutes

= 0.6 * 60 + 0.5 * 6 + 0.35 * 3.3

= 36 + 3 + 1.29

= 40.29

So, the total number of towels they can fold in one hour is 40.29.
