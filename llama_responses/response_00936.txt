Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie. We also know that Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie. So, if Billie has 18 crayons, Bobbie has 3 x 18 = 54 crayons.

Since Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie, and Bobbie has 54 crayons, Lizzie has 54 / 2 = 27 crayons.

Answer: 27
