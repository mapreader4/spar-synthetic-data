Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

Elsa has a ratio of coins that is 10:45. This means that for every 10 coins Elsa has, Amalie has 45 coins. 

Let's use the total number of coins to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of coins is x. 

Elsa has 10x and Amalie has 45x. Since they have a ratio of 10:45, we can set up the equation as 10x = 45x.

Now, we know that the total number of coins is 440. So we can set up an equation as 10x = 440. 

We can then solve for x by dividing both sides by 10. 

10x = 440 / 10 = 44.

So, Amalie has 44 coins left.
