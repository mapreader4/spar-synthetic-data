Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Emmanuel will stay in Guam for 10 days.
2. The cost of international data will be $3.50 per day.
3. Emmanuel's regular plan costs $175 per month.

To find the total cost of the international data for December, we need to multiply the daily cost by the number of days:

$3.50 x 10 =?

We can multiply 3.50 by 10 to find the total cost:

3.50 x 10 = 35

Now, we need to add this to the cost of Emmanuel's regular plan:

$175 + 35 =?

Subtracting the regular plan from the total cost, we get:

$175 - 35 = 140

Answer: 140
