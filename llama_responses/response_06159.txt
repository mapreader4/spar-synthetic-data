Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total cost of the 10 meals sold at $8 each:

10 x 8 = 80

Next, let's find the total cost of the 5 meals sold at $10 each:

5 x 10 = 50

Next, let's find the total cost of the 20 meals sold at $4 each:

20 x 4 = 80

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the meals:

80 + 50 + 80 = 210

The restaurant made a total of 210 dollars throughout the day.
