Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the tower has 54 blocks.

In the first 5 rounds, each player removes one block, so the number of blocks remaining is:

54 - 5 = 49

Since there are 5 players, including Jess, each player removes one block in each round. The blocks are removed in a circular manner, so the order doesn't matter. We can assume Jess's father goes first in the sixth round.

After the first 5 rounds, the number of blocks remaining is 49. Since Jess's father goes first in the sixth round, he removes one block, leaving:

49 - 1 = 48

Now it's Jess's turn. She removes a block, knocking down the tower. So, the number of blocks remaining before her turn is:

48

Answer: 48
