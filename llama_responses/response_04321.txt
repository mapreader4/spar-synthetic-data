Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee.
* Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee.

Let's denote the number of jellybeans Lee has as x. Then, we know that Arnold has x/2 jellybeans, since he has half as many jellybeans as Lee.

We are given that Arnold has 5 jellybeans. So, we can set up an equation:

x/2 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 5 * 2
x = 10

Now, we know that Lee has 10 jellybeans. Since Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee, we can set up an equation:

Tino = 24 + 10

Tino = 34

Answer: 34
