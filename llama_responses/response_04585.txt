Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the 2-liter container of milk is full, which means it contains 2000 ml of milk.

Jasmine can pour milk from the container in portions. Let's assume she pours out a portion of milk. Let's call this portion x ml.

The problem asks us to find how many portions of 200 ml milk Jasmine can pour from a full 2-liter container of milk. We know that 200 ml is 0.2 liters, or 1000/5, so we can set up an equation to solve this problem.

Let's set up the equation:

1000/5 = x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200

So, the number of portions of 200 ml milk Jasmine can pour from a full 2-liter container of milk is 40.
