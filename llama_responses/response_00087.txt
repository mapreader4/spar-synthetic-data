Let's start by finding the weight of the cow after it gained 1.5 times its starting weight.  The cow's starting weight is 400 pounds.  When multiplied by 1.5, it becomes 1.5 x 400 = 600 pounds.  The cow is now 600 pounds.  The cow is now worth 3 times its new weight, which is 3 x 600 = 1800.  The cow is worth 1800 dollars.  The cow was worth 400 dollars less than this, so the increase in value is 1800 - 400 = 1400.  The cow gained 1400 dollars.
