Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the time it takes to clip each of the cat's nails. It takes Nissa 10 seconds to clip each of her cat's nails. Since the cat has 4 claws on each foot, and there are 4 feet, the total number of claws is 4 x 4 = 16. So, it will take 16 x 10 seconds = 160 seconds to clip all the cat's nails.

Next, it takes 90 seconds to clean each of her ears. Since there are 2 ears, it will take 90 x 2 = 180 seconds to clean both ears.

Finally, it takes 5 minutes to shampoo her. So, the total time it takes to groom the cat is 160 + 180 + 300 = 540 seconds.

Answer: 540
