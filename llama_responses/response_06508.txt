Let's break this down step by step.

Lisa has 4 children, and each child had 3 spoons when they were babies. So, the total number of spoons from the children's baby days is:

4 children x 3 spoons/child = 12 spoons

Additionally, Lisa has 2 decorative spoons she created.

So, the total number of spoons she has so far is:

12 spoons (from children's baby days) + 2 decorative spoons = 14 spoons

Now, Lisa is adding these spoons to her new set of cutlery, which has:

* 10 large spoons
* 15 teaspoons

Let's combine the large spoons and teaspoons into a single category, "spoons", since we don't care about the distinction between large spoons and teaspoons. There are:

10 large spoons + 15 teaspoons = 25 spoons

in the new set of cutlery.

To find the total number of spoons Lisa now has, we add the spoons from the children's baby days and the decorative spoons to the spoons from the new set of cutlery:

14 spoons (from children's baby days and decorative spoons) + 25 spoons (from new set of cutlery) = 39 spoons

Answer: 39
