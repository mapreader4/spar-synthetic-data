Let's start by letting x be Diana's age. Since Diana is twice as old as Grace, we can set up the equation x = 2x. We know that Grace is 3 years old now, so Grace is 3 years ago, Diana is 3 - 3 = 0 years old. Since Diana is twice as old, Diana's age is 2(0) = 0. So, Diana is 0 years old. Diana is 0 years old today.
