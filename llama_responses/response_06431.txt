Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of money John got from selling the PlayStation. He sold it for 20% less than its value, so we can calculate the sale price by multiplying the original value by 0.8 (1 - 0.2).

The original value of the PlayStation is $400, so the sale price is 400 x 0.8 = 320.

John also spent $200 on accessories, so we need to subtract that from the sale price to find the amount of money he has left.

320 - 200 = 120

Answer: 120
