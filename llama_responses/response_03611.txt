Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The first turkey is 6 kilograms, and the cost of a kilogram of turkey is $2, so the cost of the first turkey is 6 * 2 = $12.
2. The second turkey is 9 kilograms, and the cost of a kilogram of turkey is $2, so the cost of the second turkey is 9 * 2 = $18.
3. The third turkey is twice the weight of the second turkey, so it is 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms. The cost of the third turkey is 18 * 2 = $36.
4. To find the total cost of all the turkeys, we add the cost of the three turkeys: 12 + 18 + 36 = $66.

Answer: 66
