To find the area of the original room, we can multiply the length and width together to get 13 * 18 = 234 square feet.  Then, we increase each dimension by 2 feet.  This means the new dimensions are 15 * 20 = 300 square feet.  Then, we add 3 rooms of equal size, so we multiply 300 * 3 = 900 square feet.  Then, we add 1 room of twice that size, so we multiply 900 * 2 = 1800 square feet.  The total area is 234 + 900 + 1800 = 2134 square feet.  The answer is: Answer: 2134.
