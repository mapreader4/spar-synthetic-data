Let's start by calculating the total number of fish Danny has initially:

94 guppies + 76 angelfish + 89 tiger sharks + 58 Oscar fish = 317

Now, let's calculate the number of fish Danny sells:

30 guppies + 48 angelfish + 17 tiger sharks + 24 Oscar fish = 119

Now, let's subtract the number of fish Danny sells from the total:

317 - 119 = 198

So, the number of fish that will remain is:

Answer: 198
