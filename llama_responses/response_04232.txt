Let's break this down step by step.

1. Beyonce releases 5 different singles on iTunes.
This means that Beyonce releases 5 songs in total.

2. Then she releases 2 albums that each has 15 songs.
This means that Beyonce releases 2 x 15 = 30 songs.

3. And she also releases 1 album that has 20 songs.
This means that Beyonce releases 20 more songs.

4. To find the total number of songs Beyonce has released, we add the number of singles, the number of songs in the 2 albums, and the number of songs in the 1 album. This gives us: 5 + 30 + 20 = 35.

Answer: 35
