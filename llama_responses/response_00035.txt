Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that 40% of the students got a final grade below B. We also know that there are 60 students in Grade 5.

Let's say the number of students who got a final grade below B is x.

We know that 40% of the 60 students got a final grade below B. To find the number of students who got a final grade below B, we can set up an equation:

0.4x = 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get:

x = 40 * 100 / 4
x = 10

Answer: 10
