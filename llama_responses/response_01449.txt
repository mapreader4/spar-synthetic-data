Let's break it down step by step.

On Saturday, Erica saw 3 lions and 2 elephants. So, the total number of animals she saw on Saturday is 3 + 2 = 5.

On Sunday, she saw 2 buffaloes and 5 leopards. So, the total number of animals she saw on Sunday is 2 + 5 = 7.

On Monday, she saw 5 rhinos and 3 warthogs. So, the total number of animals she saw on Monday is 5 + 3 = 8.

To find the total number of animals Erica saw, we add the total from each day: 5 (Saturday) + 7 (Sunday) + 8 (Monday) = 20.

Answer: 20
