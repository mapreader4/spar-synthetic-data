Let's break this down step by step.

1. The first drink is 12 ounces with 250 grams of caffeine. 12 ounces is 12/1 = 12 ounces. 12 ounces is 250 grams, so the first drink has 250 grams of caffeine.

2. The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce. 3 times more caffeinated is 250 * 3 = 750. But it is 2 ounces, so the second drink has 2 * 750/2 = 750/2 = 375 grams of caffeine.

3. The pill has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined. 2 drinks combined is 250 + 375 = 625. 625 grams of caffeine is 625 grams of caffeine.

So, John consumed 250 + 375 = 625 grams of caffeine. The answer is: Answer: 625.
