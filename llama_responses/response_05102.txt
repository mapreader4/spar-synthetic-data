Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of books Loris needs:

Loris needs 3 more books than Lamont, who has twice the number of books Darryl has. Let's say Darryl has x books. Then, Lamont will have 2x books.

So, we can set up the equation:

2x = Darryl's books

Since Darryl has 20 books, we can solve for x:

2x = 20

x = 10

Now, we can find the number of books Lamont has:

Lamont has 2x = 2(10) = 20 books.

Finally, we can find the number of books Loris needs:

Loris needs 3 more books than Lamont, who has 20 books. So, Loris needs 20 + 3 = 23 books.

Answer: 23
