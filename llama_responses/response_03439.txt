Let's start by letting x be the number of items that Samantha found.  Then, Lewis found 4 more items than Samantha.  So, Lewis found 4 + x items.

Samantha found 4 items.  Samantha found 4 items.  Tanya found 4 / 4 = 1 items.

Lewis found 4 + x - 1 = 4 + x - 1 = x + 3.

Lewis found 4 + 3 = 7 items.
