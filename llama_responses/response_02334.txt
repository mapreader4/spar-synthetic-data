Let's break down the information given:

1. The first fish tank has 7 goldfish and 8 beta fish.
2. The second fish tank has twice as many fish as the first tank. So, it has 7 * 2 = 14 fish.
3. The third fish tank has a third of the number of fish in the second fish tank. So, it has 14 / 3 = 4.67 fish.

So, the third fish tank has 4 fish.
