Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how much Josiah saves. Josiah puts a quarter in his piggy bank every day for 24 days. So, Josiah saves 25 cents per day. For 24 days, Josiah saves 25 * 24 = 600 cents. 600 cents is 6 dollars.

Next, let's find out how much Leah saves. Leah saves 50 cents in an empty pickle jar every day for 20 days. So, Leah saves 50 cents per day. For 20 days, Leah saves 50 * 20 = 1000 cents. 1000 cents is 10 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much Megan saves. Megan saves twice as much as Leah for 12 days. So, Megan saves 2 * 10 dollars = 20 dollars.

Now, let's add up the amount saved by the three children. Josiah saves 6 dollars, Leah saves 10 dollars, and Megan saves 20 dollars. The total is 6 + 10 + 20 = 36 dollars.
