Let's break it down step by step:

Michael has 4 packs of crayons initially. He wants to buy 2 more packs. So, he will have 4 + 2 = 6 packs of crayons.

One pack of crayons costs $2.5. So, to buy 2 packs, it will cost 2 x 2.5 = 5 dollars.

So, Michael will have 6 packs of crayons and will spend 5 dollars.
