Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first figure out how long the subway ride takes. The subway ride takes 10 hours, so the train ride takes 10 hours.

Then, Andrew takes the train and rides for twice as much time as the subway ride, so the train ride takes 20 hours.

The total time spent on the train is 10 + 20 = 30 hours.

Andrew then bikes the remaining distance for 8 hours. So, he bikes for 8 hours.

The total time taken to bike is 8 hours.

The total time to reach the Bronx is the sum of the time spent on the subway, train, and biking. So, the total time is 10 + 30 + 8 = 48 hours.

Answer: 48
