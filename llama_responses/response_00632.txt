Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom.
* Gwi has 3 times as many watermelon seeds as Yeon.
* Bom has 300 watermelon seeds.

We know that Gwi has 3 times as many watermelon seeds as Yeon, so Gwi has 3 x 40 = 120 watermelon seeds.
We also know that Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom, so Gwi has 40 + 300 = 380 watermelon seeds.
Then, we can find the total number of seeds by adding the seeds from Gwi and Bom: 120 + 300 = 420.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 420
