Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Jerry bought 48 firecrackers.
2. 12 were confiscated by the police, leaving 48 - 12 = 36 firecrackers.
3. 1/6 of the remaining firecrackers are defective, so 1/6 * 36 = 6 firecrackers are defective.
4. The number of good firecrackers left is 36 - 6 = 30.
5. Jerry set off half of the good firecrackers, so 30 / 2 = 15 firecrackers were set off.

Answer: 15
