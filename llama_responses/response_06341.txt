Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The ship navigates for 21 days before reaching port. This means the ship departs from Shanghai and takes 21 days to reach Vancouver.

2. The customs and regulatory processes in Vancouver take 4 days. This means the ship arrives in Vancouver and spends 4 days in port.

3. Finally, the ship moves the cargo from the port to the warehouse and arrives on the 7th day.

4. The warehouse is expecting the shipment 2 days from today. This means that the ship should arrive at the warehouse 2 days after the 7th day.

To find the day the ship departs from Shanghai, we need to add the total time it takes to reach the warehouse. This is 21 days (from Shanghai to Vancouver) + 4 days (in Vancouver) + 2 days (until the shipment is expected in the warehouse).

So, the ship departs from Shanghai 21 + 4 + 2 = 27 days ago.
