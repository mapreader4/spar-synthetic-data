Let's break this down step by step.

The carpenter has 8 logs that can make 5 woodblocks each, so the total number of woodblocks he can make is 8 * 5 = 40.

The carpenter needs 80 woodblocks in total. So, to find out how many more he needs, we need to subtract 40 from 80.

80 - 40 = 40.

Answer: 40
