Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the speed of Luis in miles per hour. We know that he drives 80 miles in 2 hours, so we can divide 80 miles by 2 hours to find the speed.

80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour

Now, to find the distance Luis will go in 15 minutes, we can multiply the speed by 1/4, since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 15 minutes is 1/4 of an hour.

40 miles per hour * 1/4 = 10 miles per minute

So, the answer is:

Answer: 10
