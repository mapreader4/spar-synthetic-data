Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much the plane ticket will cost. If the ticket costs $24 for each person, and there are 2 people going, then the total cost of the plane ticket will be 2 x 24 = 48.

Next, let's figure out how much the hotel will cost. The cost of the hotel is $12 per person per day, and they will be staying for 3 days. So, the total cost of the hotel will be 3 x 12 = 36.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane ticket and the cost of the hotel together. The total cost will be 48 + 36 = 84.

Answer: 84
