Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many megabytes Julia can download in one second. We know her internet speed is 20 MBps, which is 20 megabytes per second.

In one second, Julia can download 20 MB.

Now, we need to find out how many seconds are in half an hour. There are 30 seconds in a minute, and 2 minutes in an hour. So, half an hour is 15 minutes. To convert 15 minutes into seconds, we multiply 15 by 60, since there are 60 seconds in a minute. This gives us 900 seconds.

Now, we multiply the number of megabytes Julia can download in one second by the number of seconds in half an hour. We get:

20 MBps * 900 seconds = 18,000 MB

So, Julia can download 18,000 MB in half an hour.
