Let's first count the number of birds that Gabrielle saw. She saw 5 robins, 4 cardinals, and 3 blue jays. So, the total number of birds she saw is 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.

Let's count the number of birds that Chase saw. He saw 2 robins, 3 blue jays, and 5 cardinals. So, the total number of birds he saw is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.

To find the difference between the number of birds Gabrielle saw and the number of birds Chase saw, we can subtract 12 - 10. 12 - 10 is 2.

To find the percentage of birds Gabrielle saw that is more than Chase, we can divide 2 by 12. 2 / 12 is 1/6.

Answer: 16.
