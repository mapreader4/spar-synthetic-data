To find the total calories in the salad, I will first find the calories from the lettuce, the cucumber, and the croutons.

The lettuce has 30 calories. The cucumber has 80 calories. The 12 croutons have 20 calories each, so the total calories from the croutons is 12 x 20 = 240.

To find the total calories in the salad, I will add the calories from the lettuce, the cucumber, and the croutons.

30 + 80 + 240 = 310

Answer: 310
