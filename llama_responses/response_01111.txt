Let's break it down step by step.

1. The butcher is asked for 4 1/2 pound steaks.  1/2 pound is equal to 0.5 pound.  So, the total weight of the steaks is 4 * 0.5 = 2 pounds.  The cost of the steaks is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

2. The butcher also asked for a pound and half of chicken breasts.  1/2 pound is equal to 0.5 pound.  So, the total weight of the chicken breasts is 1 pound.  The cost of the chicken breasts is 1 * $8.00 = $8.00.

3. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the steaks and the chicken breasts together.  The total cost is $30.00 + $8.00 = $38.00.

Answer: $38.00
