Let's break this down step by step!

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee in an hour.
* Brayan drinks twice as much coffee as Ivory.

To find out how much coffee Ivory drinks in an hour, we can multiply Brayan's coffee consumption by 1/2, since Brayan drinks twice as much as Ivory. This gives us:

* Ivory drinks 4 cups / 2 = 2 cups of coffee in an hour.

Now, we need to find the total number of cups of coffee they drink in 5 hours. To do this, we can multiply the amount each of them drinks in an hour by the number of hours they drink for. 

For Brayan:
* Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee in an hour, and there are 5 hours, so Brayan drinks 4 cups/hour x 5 hours = 20 cups of coffee in 5 hours.

For Ivory:
* Ivory drinks 2 cups of coffee in an hour, and there are 5 hours, so Ivory drinks 2 cups/hour x 5 hours = 10 cups of coffee in 5 hours.

To find the total number of cups of coffee they drink together, we add the cups of coffee they drink:

* 20 cups (Brayan) + 10 cups (Ivory) = 30 cups of coffee

Answer: 30
