Let's break down the problem step by step.

Samantha paid a deposit of $3000, which is a part of the total cost of the refrigerator. The remaining amount to be paid is the total cost of the refrigerator minus the deposit, which is $8000 - $3000 = $5000.

The total amount to be paid is $5000, and Samantha paid 30 equal monthly installments of $300 each. To find the total amount paid, we can multiply the monthly payment by the number of payments, which is 30.

$300 x 30 = $9000

The total amount paid is $9000, which is equal to the total cost of the refrigerator. This means Samantha would have saved no money by paying cash. She would have paid the same amount, $9000, if she had paid cash upfront.
