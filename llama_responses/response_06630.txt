Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of money donated each year: $240.

Next, let's find the amount that goes to the community pantry project: 1/3 of 240 is 80. So, 80 goes to the community pantry project.

Next, let's find the amount that goes to the local crisis fund: 1/2 of 240 is 120. So, 120 goes to the local crisis fund.

Next, let's find the amount that goes to the livelihood project funds: 1/4 of 240 is 60. So, 60 goes to the livelihood project funds.

Finally, the remaining amount is the contingency fund: 240 - 80 - 120 - 60 = 40. So, 40 goes to the contingency fund.

Answer: 40
