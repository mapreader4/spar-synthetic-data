Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* William read 6 books last month.
* Brad read three times as many books as William did, which is 6 * 3 = 18 books.
* This month, William read twice as much as Brad, who read 8 books.

Now, let's figure out how many books William read this month. Since William read 6 books last month, and he read twice as much as Brad this month, who read 8 books, we can find the number of books William read this month by multiplying the number of books William read last month by 2:

William read 6 books last month, and he read twice as much as Brad this month, who read 8 books. So, William read 6 * 2 = 12 books this month.

So, the total number of books read by William across the two months is 6 + 12 = 18.

Answer: 18
