Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of gifts. Harper has 3 teachers for her son and 4 teachers for her daughter. So, the total number of gifts is 3 + 4 = 7.

The total amount Harper spent is $70. To find out how much each gift cost, we need to divide the total amount by the total number of gifts.

$70 รท 7 = $10

So, each gift cost $10.
