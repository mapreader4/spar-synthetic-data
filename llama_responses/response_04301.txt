Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the items Hannah is putting in the stockings.

1. She is putting 4 candy canes in each stocking.
2. She is putting 2 beanie babies in each stocking.
3. She is putting 1 book in each stocking.

So, to find the total number of stocking stuffers, we need to multiply the number of items in each category by the number of stockings.

1. Candy canes: 4 per stocking * 3 stockings = 12
2. Beanie babies: 2 per stocking * 3 stockings = 6
3. Book: 1 per stocking * 3 stockings = 3

To find the total number of stocking stuffers, we add the total number of items from each category:

12 + 6 + 3 = 21

Answer: 21
