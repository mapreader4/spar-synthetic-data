Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what we know. Robert had 25 balls initially.

Then, Tim gave Robert half of his 40 balls. To find out how many balls Robert has now, we need to find half of 40.

Half of 40 is 20. So, Robert has 25 + 20 = 45 balls now.

Answer: 45
