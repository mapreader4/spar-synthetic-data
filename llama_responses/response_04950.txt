To solve this problem, we can use the formula: Distance = Rate * Time.

Let's first find the distance around the park that Jerome runs. Since it takes Jerome 6 hours to run the trail, and he runs at a constant speed of 4 MPH, the distance is:

Distance = 6 hours * 4 MPH = 24 miles.

Now, let's find Nero's speed. We know that it takes Nero 3 hours to run the same trail. So, we can set up the equation:

Distance = Rate * Time = 24 miles. We can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the speed:

24 miles / 3 = 8 MPH.

So, Nero runs at a speed of 8 MPH in the park.
