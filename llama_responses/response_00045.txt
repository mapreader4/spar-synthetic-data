Let's break down the cost of the treats:

* 4 bags of Reese's for $9 per bag: 4 x $9 = $36
* 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag: 3 x $5 = $15
* 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag: 5 x $7 = $35

Add the cost of all the treats together: $36 + $15 + $35 = $86

The total cost of the unicorn pi√±ata and the treats is $86.
