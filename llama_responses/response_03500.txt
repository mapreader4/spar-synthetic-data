To solve this problem, we need to find the speed at which we travel 12 miles in 90 minutes.

Let's divide the total distance by the time. 12 miles / 90 minutes = 12 / 90 = 0.1333 miles per minute.

To convert this to miles per hour, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 0.1333 * 60 = 80 miles per hour.

Answer: 80
