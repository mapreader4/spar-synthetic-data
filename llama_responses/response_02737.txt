Let's break this down step by step.

On Monday, there were 7 children and 5 adults, which is a total of 7 + 5 = 12 people. Child tickets cost $3, so the total cost for child tickets on Monday would be 7 x 3 = 21. Adult tickets cost $4, so the total cost for adult tickets would be 5 x 4 = 20. The total cost for both days would be 21 + 20 = 41.

Answer: 41
