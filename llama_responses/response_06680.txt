Let's break down the information given to us:

1. 20 computers were given to John to fix.
2. 20% of them were unfixable, so 20% of 20 is 4.
3. 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come, so 40% of 20 is 8.
4. The rest of the computers, 20 - (20 + 4 + 8), were fixable.

Let's calculate the number of computers John was able to fix right away:

20 - (20 + 4 + 8) = 20 - 12 = 8

So, John was able to fix 8 computers right away.
