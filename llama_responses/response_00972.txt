Let's break this down step by step.

The elevator is on the 9th floor initially. It goes down 7 floors, so it will be on the 2nd floor after that. Then it goes up 3 floors, so it will be on the 5th floor. Finally, it goes up 8 floors, so it will be on the 13th floor.

So, there are 13 floors in the building.
