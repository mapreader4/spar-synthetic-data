Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Jordan's dog, Max, was born on the same day that Luka turned 4 years old.
2. Luka is exactly 2 years older than is Aubrey.

From the first statement, we know that Max was born on the day Luka turned 4 years old, so Max is also 4 years old.
From the second statement, we know that Luka is 2 years older than Aubrey. This means that Aubrey is Luka minus 2 years, so Aubrey is 2 years old.
Since Aubrey is 8 years old on his birthday, we can subtract 2 years from 8 to get the age of Aubrey when Max was born, which is 6 years old.

Answer: 6
