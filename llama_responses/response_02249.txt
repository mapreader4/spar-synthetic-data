Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's assume that in a high season, 6 packs of tuna fish are sold per hour. This means that in a high season, the total amount of tuna fish sold is 6 * 60 = 360 packs.

In a low season, 4 packs of tuna fish are sold per hour. This means that in a low season, the total amount of tuna fish sold is 4 * 60 = 240 packs.

To find the difference between the total amount of tuna fish sold in a high season and a low season, we need to subtract the total amount of tuna fish sold in a low season from the total amount of tuna fish sold in a high season.

The difference between the total amount of tuna fish sold in a high season and a low season is 360 - 240 = 120.

Answer: 120
