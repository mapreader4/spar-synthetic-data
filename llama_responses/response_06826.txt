Let's start by identifying the number of dolls with black and brown hair. Since there are 4 dolls with blonde hair, and 4 times as many dolls with brown hair as blonde hair, that means there are 4 * 4 = 16 dolls with brown hair. Since there are 2 fewer dolls with black hair than brown hair, that means there are 16 - 2 = 14 dolls with black hair. To find the total number of dolls with black and brown hair, we add 14 and 16 together, which is 14 + 16 = 30. Since there are 4 dolls with blonde hair, and we need to find how many more dolls with black and brown hair combined Lindsay has than blonde-haired dolls, we subtract 4 from 30, which is 30 - 4 = 26. So, the answer is: Answer: 26.
