Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that John books 3 nights at a hotel room for $250 a night. We are asked to find out how much he pays.

The problem tells us that he has a $100 discount.  This means that he gets a discount of $100 on the $250 price.

So, we need to subtract the discount from the original price.  To do this, we subtract $100 from $250.

$250 - $100 = $150

So, John pays $150.

Answer: 150
