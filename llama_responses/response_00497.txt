Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate James's average points per game for the week. To do this, we need to add up all the points he scored and then divide by the number of games he played.

James scored 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26 = 150 points in 5 games.

To find his average, we divide the total points by the number of games:

150 points รท 5 games = 30 points per game

Since James averaged 30 or more points per game, he gets paid $10,000.

Answer: 10000
