Let's break this down step by step.

1. We know that there are 40 people in the race, and 3/5 of them are riding on bicycles. To find the number of people riding on bicycles, we can multiply 3/5 by 40, which gives us 24 people.

2. Since each bicycle has 2 wheels, and there are 24 people riding on bicycles, the total number of wheels is 24 x 2 = 48.

3. The tricycles have 3 wheels each, and there are 40 - 24 = 16 people riding on tricycles.

4. To find the combined number of wheels of the bicycles and tricycles, we add 48 (bicycle wheels) + 16 (tricycle wheels) = 64.

Answer: 64
