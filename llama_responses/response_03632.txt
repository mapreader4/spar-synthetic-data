Let's start by finding the cost of one notebook. Each notebook has 50 pages. Since James bought 2 notebooks, we can find the cost per page by dividing the total cost by the total number of pages. The cost of 2 notebooks is $5, so we can set up the equation as 5 รท 2 =? 50 pages. We can simplify the fraction to 5 รท 25 =? 0.20. So, each page cost 0.20 dollars.
