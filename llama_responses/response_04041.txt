Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of oranges the boy has. The boy has 12 oranges initially.

He gives one-third of this number to his brother. One-third of 12 is 4, so he gives his brother 4 oranges.

The remainder of the 12 oranges is 8, as 12 - 4 = 8. He gives one-fourth of the remainder to his friend. One-fourth of 8 is 2, so he gives his friend 2 oranges.

So, his friend gets 2 oranges.
