Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the length of the shadow at noon.
Since the shadows from the building are 5 feet longer at 1 pm, the length of the shadow at noon is 5 feet.

Step 2: Determine the length of the shadow 6 hours later, at 6 pm.
Since the shadow is 6 hours longer, the length of the shadow at 6 pm is 5 + 6 = 11 feet.
