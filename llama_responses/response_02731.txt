Let's break it down step by step.

Jeff had to swim 98 laps in total.
He swam 27 laps on Saturday.
He swam 15 laps on Sunday morning.
So, to find out how many laps he had remaining when he took the break, we need to subtract the number of laps he swam on Saturday and Sunday morning from the total number of laps.

Let's do the subtraction:

98 (total laps) - 27 (lapses swam on Saturday) = 71

71 laps remaining

Then, he swam 15 laps on Sunday morning, so we need to subtract that from the remaining laps:

71 (laps remaining) - 15 (laps swam on Sunday) = 56

So, Jeff had 56 laps remaining when he took the break.
