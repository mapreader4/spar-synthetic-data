Let's break down Teresa's purchases step by step.

First, she buys 2 fancy ham and cheese sandwiches for $7.75 each. The total cost of the sandwiches is:

2 x $7.75 = $15.50

Next, she buys some salami for $4.00.

Then, she buys more brie, which is three times the price of the salami. The price of the salami is $4.00, so the price of the brie is:

$4.00 x 3 = $12.00

She also buys a 1/4 pound of olives, which costs $10.00 per pound. To find the total cost of the olives, we need to convert the weight from pounds to a fraction of a pound. 1/4 pound is equivalent to 0.25 pounds. Then, we can multiply the cost per pound by the weight:

$10.00 x 0.25 = $2.50

She also buys 1/2 pound of feta cheese, which costs $8.00 per pound. To find the total cost of the feta cheese, we need to convert the weight from pounds to a fraction of a pound. 1/2 pound is equivalent to 0.5 pounds. Then, we can multiply the cost per pound by the weight:

$8.00 x 0.5 = $4.00

Finally, she buys another loaf of french bread for $2.00.

To find the total amount Teresa spends at the local shop, we add up the cost of all her purchases:

$15.50 + $4.00 + $12.00 + $2.50 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $40.00
