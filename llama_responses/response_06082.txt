Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start with Chris. Chris has half as many cookies as Kenny. So, if Kenny has x cookies, Chris has x/2 cookies.

Next, Glenn has four times as many cookies as Kenny. So, if Kenny has x cookies, Glenn has 4x cookies.

We know that Glenn has 24 cookies. So, 4x = 24. We need to find the value of x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4.

x = 24/4 = 6.

So, Chris has 6 cookies, Kenny has 6 cookies, and Glenn has 24 cookies. So, in total, they have 6 + 6 + 24 = 36 cookies.

Answer: 36
