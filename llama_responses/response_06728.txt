Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of money Michael has initially. Michael has 42 dollars. 

Michael gives away half of his money to his brother. Half of 42 is 21. So, his brother now has 21 dollars.

His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. So, his brother now has 21 - 3 = 18 dollars.

Answer: 18
