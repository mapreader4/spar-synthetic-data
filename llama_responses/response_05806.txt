Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Dylan has 8 ice cubes in his glass. He puts 2 times as many ice cubes in the pitcher, so he puts 8 * 2 = 16 ice cubes in the pitcher.

Step 2: He needs to fill the trays with ice cubes. Each tray has 12 spaces for ice cubes, and he needs to fill all of them. So, he needs to fill 12 trays. Since he already used 16 ice cubes, he will need 12 more ice cubes to fill all the trays.

Answer: 12
