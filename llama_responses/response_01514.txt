Let's break this down step by step:

1. Carla spends 10 minutes sharpening her knife.
2. She spends 3 times that amount of time peeling vegetables. Since she spends 10 minutes sharpening her knife, 3 times that amount means 3 x 10 = 30 minutes.

So, Carla spends 10 + 30 minutes on these activities. In total, she spends 40 minutes on these activities.

Answer: 40
