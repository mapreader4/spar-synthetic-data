Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Parker threw the ball 16 yards.
* Grant threw the ball 25% farther than Parker, so Grant threw the ball 16 + (16 x 0.25) = 16 + 4 = 20 yards.
* Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant, so Kyle threw the ball 20 + (20 x 2) = 20 + 40 = 60 yards.

Now, we need to find out how much farther Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker. To do this, we subtract Parker's distance from Kyle's distance:

60 - 16 = 44

So, Kyle threw the ball 44 yards farther than Parker.
