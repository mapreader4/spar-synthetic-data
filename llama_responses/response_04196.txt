Let's break it down step by step.

1. The gecko lays 30 eggs per year.
2. 20 percent of 30 eggs are infertile, so we need to find 20% of 30. 20% of 30 is 6 eggs.
3. The remaining eggs are not infertile, so 30 - 6 = 24 eggs are left.
4. A third of the remaining eggs will not hatch due to calcification issues, so 1/3 of 24 eggs will not hatch. 1/3 of 24 is 8 eggs.
5. The number of eggs that will hatch is the difference between the total number of eggs and the number of eggs that will not hatch, so 24 - 8 = 16 eggs will hatch.

Answer: 16
