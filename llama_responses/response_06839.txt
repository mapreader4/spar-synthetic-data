Let's break it down step by step.

Rachel earned $200.

She spent 1/4 of the money on lunch. 1/4 of $200 is $50.

She spent 1/2 of the money on a DVD. 1/2 of $200 is $100.

So, she spent $50 on lunch and $100 on a DVD.

Now, we need to find out how much she has left. Rachel had $200 initially. She spent $50 on lunch and $100 on a DVD. To find the remaining money, we subtract $50 and $100 from the initial $200.

$200 - $50 - $100 = $50

Answer: 50
