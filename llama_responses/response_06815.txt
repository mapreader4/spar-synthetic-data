Let's break this down step by step.

There are 4 tiger enclosures in a row. Behind each of these are 2 zebra enclosures, so there are 4 x 2 = 8 zebra enclosures. There are 3 times as many giraffe enclosures as zebra enclosures, so there are 8 x 3 = 24 giraffe enclosures.

The tiger enclosures hold 4 tigers, the zebra enclosures hold 10 zebras, and the giraffe enclosures hold 2 giraffes. So, the total number of animals is 4 + 10 + 2 = 16.

Answer: 16
