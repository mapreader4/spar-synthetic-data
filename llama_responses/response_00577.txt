Let's break this down step by step:

1. Each team has 10 members.
2. Each member needs 2 pairs of skates, so each team needs 20 skates.
3. Each pair of skates requires 3 sets of laces.
4. Since each team has 20 skates, and each pair of skates needs 3 sets of laces, the total number of laces needed is 20 * 3 = 60.
5. However, since there are 2 teams, the total number of laces needed is 2 * 60 = 120.

Answer: 120
