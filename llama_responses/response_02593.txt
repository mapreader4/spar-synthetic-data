Let's start by identifying the number of sheep Adam has. Since it is given that he has twice as many sheep as cows, and he has 12 cows, we can multiply 12 by 2 to get the number of sheep. 12 * 2 = 24. So Adam has 24 sheep. He decides to buy 3 pigs for every sheep he has, which means he will buy 24 * 3 = 72 pigs. So the total number of animals on the farm will be 12 (the number of cows) + 24 (the number of sheep) + 72 (the number of pigs). 12 + 24 + 72 = 108. So, the total number of animals on the farm is 108.
