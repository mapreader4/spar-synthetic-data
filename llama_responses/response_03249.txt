Let's break this down step by step.

The cost of 1 pound of strawberries is $2.20. The cost of 1 pound of cherries is 6 times the cost of strawberries, so the cost of 1 pound of cherries is 6 x 2.20 = $13.20.

Brigit will buy 5 pounds of strawberries, which will cost 5 x 2.20 = $11.00. Brigit will also buy 5 pounds of cherries, which will cost 5 x 13.20 = $66.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the strawberries and the cost of the cherries: 11.00 + 66.00 = 77.00.

Answer: 77
