Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

- The cost of each Corgi dog is $1000.
- Mr. Mayer wants to make a 30% profit.
- His friend wants to buy 2 dogs.

To find the price of each dog, we can multiply the cost of each dog by 1.3 (the 30% profit) to get the selling price:

$1000 * 1.3 = $1300

Then, since his friend wants to buy 2 dogs, we multiply the price by 2:

$1300 * 2 = $2600

So, the friend should pay $2600.
