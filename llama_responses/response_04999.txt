Let's break it down step by step.

Chastity bought 4 lollipops, which cost $1.50 each. So, the total cost of the lollipops is 4 x $1.50 = $6.00.

She also bought 2 packs of gummies, which cost $2 each. So, the total cost of the gummies is 2 x $2 = $4.

In total, Chastity spent $6.00 + $4 = $10.00. She started with $15, so she has spent $15 - $10.00 = $5.00 left.
