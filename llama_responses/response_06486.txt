Let's break this problem down step by step.

Janet needs to drive 30 miles east to see her dermatologist, and then 50 miles west to see her gynecologist. To find the total distance she needs to drive, we need to add the two distances together:

30 miles (east) + 50 miles (west) = 80 miles

So, Janet needs to drive a total of 80 miles.

Since her car gets 20 miles per gallon, to find out how many gallons of gas she will use, we can divide the total distance by the miles per gallon:

80 miles / 20 miles per gallon = 4 gallons

So, Janet will use 4 gallons of gas to drive to both appointments and back home again.
