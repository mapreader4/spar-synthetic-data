Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Tuesday, Sarah pulled 25 weeds.

The next day, she pulled three times the number of weeds she did the day before, so she pulled 3 x 25 = 75 weeds.

On Thursday, her allergies bothered her and she could only pull up one-fifth of the weeds she pulled on the day before. Since she pulled 75 weeds the day before, she pulled 1/5 x 75 = 15 weeds.

Finally, on Friday, it rained for half the day and she managed to pull up 10 fewer weeds than she did on Thursday. She pulled 15 weeds on Thursday, so she pulled 15 - 10 = 5 weeds on Friday.

To find the total number of weeds Sarah pulled, I add up the number of weeds she pulled each day:

25 + 75 + 15 + 5 = 120

Answer: 120
