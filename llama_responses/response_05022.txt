Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Georgie can run 40 yards within 5 seconds. This means that his speed can be calculated as 40 yards per 5 seconds, or 8 yards per second.

Now, if Georgie can improve his speed by 40%, we need to find 40% of his original speed. To do this, we can multiply his original speed by 0.4:

8 yards per second * 0.4 = 3.2 yards per second

So, Georgie's new speed is 3.2 yards per second.

To find out how many yards he can run within 10 seconds, we can multiply his new speed by the time:

3.2 yards per second * 10 seconds = 32 yards

Answer: 32
