Let's break it down step by step.

Billy and Jenny order a $20 steak and a $5 drink. To find the total cost of the food, we add $20 + $5, which is $25.

To find the 20% tip, we multiply $25 by 20%. 20% of $25 is $5.

To find 80% of the tip, we multiply $5 by 80%. 80% of $5 is $4.

To find the total amount Billy has to pay, we add the total cost of the food and the tip, which is $25 + $4, which is $29.

Answer: 29
