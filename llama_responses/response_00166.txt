Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Tuesday, Grandpa Lou watched movies for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes, which is equal to 270 minutes.
2. If he watched the same number of movies on Wednesday, then he watched 2 times as many movies as he did on Tuesday, which means he watched 2 x 270 minutes = 540 minutes on Wednesday.
3. The total time he watched movies in two days is 270 + 540 minutes = 810 minutes.
4. Since each movie is 90 minutes long, we can divide the total time by 90 to find the number of movies he watched: 810 minutes รท 90 = 9.

Answer: 9
