Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the ratio given: 3:5:7. This means that for every 3 marbles, Brittany has 5 marbles, and for every 7 marbles, Brittany has 5 marbles. 

Since Brittany has 600 marbles, let's divide that by the sum of the ratios: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15. This gives us the total number of groups of marbles that Brittany has: 600 รท 15 = 40.

Now, Brittany gives Alex half of her marbles. Half of 40 is 20. So, Alex gets 20 marbles.
