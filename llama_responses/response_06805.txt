Let's break this down step by step.

The iPhone 12 costs $800. It has a 15% discount, so the discounted price is 100% - 15% of $800 = 85% of $800 = $680.

The iWatch costs $300. It has a 10% discount, so the discounted price is 100% - 10% of $300 = 90% of $300 = $270.

The total price of the iPhone 12 and the iWatch is $680 + $270 = $950.

The cashback is 2%, so the final price is 100% - 2% of $950 = 98% of $950 = $931.

Answer: 931
