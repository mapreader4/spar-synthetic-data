Let's start by identifying the number of cookies Abigail and Grayson collected. Abigail collected 2 boxes, and each box contains 48 cookies. So, Abigail collected 2 x 48 cookies, which is 96 cookies. Grayson collected 3 quarters of a box. Since a box contains 48 cookies, Grayson collected 3 x (48 / 4) = 36 cookies. Now, let's add the number of cookies they collected together. Abigail collected 96 cookies, and Grayson collected 36 cookies. So, the total number of cookies they collected is 96 + 36 = 132.
