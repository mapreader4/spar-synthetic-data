Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* The hotel has 10 floors with 10 identical rooms on each floor.
* The last floor is unavailable for the guests.

Let's assume that the unavailable floor is the 10th floor. Since the last floor is unavailable, we can't include it in our count.

So, we have 9 floors with 10 rooms on each floor, except for the 10th floor. Therefore, the total number of rooms available is:

9 floors x 10 rooms per floor = 90 rooms

However, we need to subtract the rooms on the 10th floor because it's not available. So, we subtract 10 from 90:

90 - 10 = 80

Answer: 80
