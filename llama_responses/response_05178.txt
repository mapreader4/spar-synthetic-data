Let's start by finding out how many apples Irene can buy in a week.  She can buy 4 apples for 2 dollars.  So, she can buy 8 apples for 4 dollars, and 16 apples for 8 dollars.  In a week, she will need 14 apples.  Since a small apple is 1/4 of a pound, that means she will need 7 pounds of apples.  At 2 dollars per pound, that is 14 dollars.
