Let's break down the information given:

* 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each = 5 x 7 = 35
* 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each = 2 x 10 = 20
* 4 tops for the same price = x

We don't know the price of the tops yet, so let's say it's x. We can set up an equation to solve for x.

35 + 20 = x + x
x = 35 + 20 - 35 = x
x = 55

So, each top cost $5.
