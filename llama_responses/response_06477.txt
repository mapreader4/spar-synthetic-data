Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate how much money Jackson has earned so far:

$300 + $40 = $340

He has earned $340 so far. His goal is to earn $1000, so he needs to earn:

$1000 - $340 = $660

to reach his goal.

Since he earns an average of $10 for every 4 houses he visits, we can set up an equation to represent this:

$660 = 4x10

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10:

x = 66

So, Jackson needs to visit 66 houses to earn $10 each to reach his goal. Since he has 5 days left in the week, we can divide 66 by 5 to find out how many houses he needs to visit each day:

66 รท 5 = 13

Answer: 13
