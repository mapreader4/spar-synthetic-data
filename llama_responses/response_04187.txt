Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the cost of the computer be x.
2. The cost of the accessories is 10% of x, so the cost of the accessories is 0.1x.
3. The total cost of the computer and the accessories together is x + 0.1x.
4. Jeremy had 2x the cost of the computer before the purchase. So, 2x = 2x.
5. So, the total money Jeremy had before the purchase is 2x.
6. The total cost of the computer and the accessories is 3,000. So, 3,000 = x + 0.1x.
7. We can write an equation to represent the total cost of the computer and the accessories: x + 0.1x = 3,000.
8. To solve for x, we can subtract 0.1x from both sides of the equation: x + 0.1x - 0.1x = 3,000 - 0.1x.
9. Simplify the right side of the equation by subtracting 0.1x from both sides: x = 3,000.
10. Now, we have our answer: Answer: 3,000.
