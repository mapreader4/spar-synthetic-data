Let's start by identifying the number of bolts and nuts used for the project.

The builder purchased 7 boxes of bolts with each box containing 11 bolts, so the total number of bolts is 7 * 11 = 77 bolts.

The builder purchased 3 boxes of nuts with each box containing 15 nuts, so the total number of nuts is 3 * 15 = 45 nuts.

The builder used 3 bolts and 6 nuts, which is a total of 3 + 6 = 9.

The total number of bolts and nuts used is 77 + 45 - 9 = 112.

Answer: 112
