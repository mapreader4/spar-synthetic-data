Let the price of the art piece be x. Then, after three years, the price of the art piece will be 3x. So, the increase in the price is 3x - x.

We know that the current price is 4000, so 4000 = x. We can solve for x: 4000 = x. x = 4000.

Now we know the value of x is 4000. So, in three years, the price of the art piece will be 3x, which is 3 * 4000 = 12000.

So, the increase in the price of the art piece will be 12000 - 4000 = 8000.
