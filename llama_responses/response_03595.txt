Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes. Since the farm produced 400 kg of mangoes, the total produce of apples is 2 x 400 = 800 kg.
2. The total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than the total produce of mangoes. Since the farm produced 400 kg of mangoes, the total produce of oranges is 400 + 200 = 600 kg.
3. The total produce is the sum of the produce of apples, mangoes, and oranges: 800 + 400 + 600 = 1800 kg.
4. Since Mr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg, the total amount of money he got is the total produce multiplied by the price per kg: 1800 kg x $50/kg = $90,000.

Answer: 90000
