Let's break down the information given. Andrew works in a company that provides a generous vacation allotment. For every 10 days worked, you get 1 vacation day.

Andrew worked 300 days last year. Since Andrew took 5 days off in March, he worked 300 - 5 = 295 days in March. 

Andrew took twice as many days off in September as he did in March. He took 5 days off in March, so in September, he took 5 * 2 = 10 days off.

To find out how many more vacation days Andrew can still take, we need to subtract the total vacation days taken from the total days worked. 

Andrew worked 295 days, and took 15 days off. 295 - 15 = 280. So Andrew can still take 280 - 280 = 0 days off. 

Andrew can take 0 days off.
