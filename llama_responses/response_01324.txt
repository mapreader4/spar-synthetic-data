Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that:

1. Three friends go out for lunch.
2. Adam spends two-thirds as much money on lunch as Rick.
3. Rick and Jose eat lunch of the same price.
4. Jose ate lunch worth $45.

From point 2, we know that Adam's lunch cost is two-thirds of Rick's lunch cost. Let's call Rick's lunch cost 'x'. Then, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Adam's lunch cost = 2/3 * x

We know that Jose's lunch cost is the same as Rick's lunch cost, so we can set up another equation to represent this:

Jose's lunch cost = x

Now we have two equations and one variable. We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the first equation by 3:

2/3 * x = x
3 * x = 45

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, Adam's lunch cost is 2/3 * 15 = 10, and Rick's lunch cost is x = 15.

To find the total cost of lunch for all three, we need to add up their lunch costs:

Adam's lunch cost + Rick's lunch cost + Jose's lunch cost
10 + 15 + 15
25 + 15
40

Answer: 40
