Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the new price of the apples after the 25% price increase.

The original price of the apples is $1.6 per pound.  To find the new price after the 25% increase, we multiply the original price by 1.25 (which is 1 + 0.25).

$1.6 * 1.25 = $2.00

So, the new price of the apples is $2.00 per pound.

Now, we need to find the cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family.

2 pounds of apples is 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.

The cost to buy 4 pounds of apples at the new price is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.
