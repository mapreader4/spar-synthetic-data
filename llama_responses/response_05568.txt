Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, so she will make an even number of each. Let's call the number of chocolate cupcakes x.
2. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. The total number of cupcakes she has made is 36 + 48 = 84.
3. Mary wants to make 144 cupcakes in total. She has already made 84, so she needs to make 144 - 84 = 60 more cupcakes.
4. Mary wants to make an equal number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. She will make x chocolate and x vanilla cupcakes.
5. Since she needs to make a total of 60 cupcakes, she will make x + x cupcakes in total. To make this possible, x must be 30.

So, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes.

Answer: 30
