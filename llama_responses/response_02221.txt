Let's break it down step by step.

In July, Diana earned $150.

In August, she earned 3 times this amount, which is $150 * 3 = $450.

In September, she earned twice the money she earned in August, which is $450 * 2 = $900.

To find the total amount Diana earned over these three months, we add up the amounts: $150 + $450 + $900. This gives us a total of $1500.
