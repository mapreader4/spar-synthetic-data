Let the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill be x.

The given condition is that the depth of the base of the hill is 300m. So, we can set up an equation: 300 = 1/4x.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

300 = 4/4x
300 * 4 = x
1200 = x

Answer: 1200
