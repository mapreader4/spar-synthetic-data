Let's break this down step by step.

Jessica has 8 pieces of paper that weigh 1/5 of an ounce each, so that is 8 * (1/5) = 1.6 ounces. Her envelope weighs 2/5 of an ounce, so she needs 2 stamps for the envelope. The letter itself weighs 1 ounce, so she needs 1 stamp for that. So, in total, she needs 1 + 2 = 3 stamps.
