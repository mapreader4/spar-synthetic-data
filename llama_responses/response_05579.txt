Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Amaya scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts. This means that Amaya scored x marks in Maths and x marks in Arts.
* She also got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music. This means that Amaya scored y marks in Social Studies and y marks in Music, where y = x + 10.
* She scored 70 in Music.

From the information given, we can write the equations:

* Maths: x - 20 = y
* Social Studies: y = x + 10
* Music: 70 = y

We can solve these equations step by step:

1. Maths: x - 20 = y
x = 50
2. Social Studies: y = x + 10
y = 50 + 10 = 60
3. Music: 70 = y
y = 70

Now, let's add up the marks scored by Amaya in all the subjects:

Maths: 50
Social Studies: 60
Music: 70
Total: 50 + 60 + 70 = 180
