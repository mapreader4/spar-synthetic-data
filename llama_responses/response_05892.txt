Let's start by identifying the number of adult men. We know that 30% of 2000 community members are adult men, which is 0.3 * 2000 = 600. Since there are twice as many adult women as adult men, there are 2 * 600 = 1200 adult women. The rest of the community members are children. The number of children is 2000 - (600 + 1200) = 2000 - 1800 = 200. Therefore, the total number of children involved in the cleaning event is 200.
