Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the distance between Xena and the cave. The cave is too big for Xena to fit into, so it's the final destination. Since Xena has a 600 foot head start, we know that the distance Xena needs to cover is 600 feet.

Now, let's think about the distance Xena needs to get away from the dragon. The dragon can burn her if it gets within 120 feet of her. So, Xena needs to maintain a distance of at least 120 feet between herself and the dragon.

Since the dragon flies 30 feet per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the dragon to cover 120 feet:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 120 feet / 30 feet/second
Time = 4 seconds

This means that if Xena stays within 120 feet of the dragon, the dragon will catch up to her in 4 seconds. To get to the cave, Xena needs to cover the 600 feet, so we can set up an equation:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 600 feet / (15 feet/second)
Time = 40 seconds

So, Xena has 40 seconds to get to the cave before the dragon catches up to her.
