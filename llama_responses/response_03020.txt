Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Erica catches 80 kg of fish in the past four months.
* She catches twice as many fish as she caught in total in the past four months today.
* She earns $20 per kg of fish.

To find out how many kg of fish she caught today, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of kg of fish caught today.

Since she catches twice as many fish as she caught in total in the past four months, we can write:

x = 2 * 80

x = 160 kg

So, Erica caught 160 kg of fish today.

To find out how much money she will have earned in the past four months including today, we multiply the number of kg of fish caught by the price per kg:

160 kg * $20 per kg = $3200

So, Erica will have earned $3200 in the past four months including today.
