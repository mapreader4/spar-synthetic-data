Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of money the vendor makes from selling 10 pairs of sunglasses.

The vendor sells 10 pairs of sunglasses for $30 each. So, the total amount of money he makes is:

10 x 30 = 300

So, the vendor makes $300 from selling 10 pairs of sunglasses.

Next, the vendor takes half of his profits and uses it to buy a new sign, which costs $20. So, the amount he uses for the sign is half of his profits:

300 / 2 = 150

The vendor uses $150 for the sign. Now, let's find the cost of each pair of sunglasses:

300 - 150 = 150

The vendor has to spend $150 to buy the sunglasses. So, the cost of each pair of sunglasses is:

Answer: 15
