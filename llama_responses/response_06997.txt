Let's start by letting x be the number of boxes Kim sold on Tuesday. We know that she sold twice as many boxes on Tuesday as she did on Wednesday, so we can write the equation 2x = x. We also know that she sold twice as many boxes on Wednesday as she did on Thursday, so we can write the equation x = 2(2x) = 2x. We are given that she sold 1200 boxes of cupcakes on Thursday, so we can set up the equation 2x = 2(2x) = 1200. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: x = 1200 / 2(2) = 1200 / 4 = 300. So, Kim sold 300 boxes on Tuesday.
