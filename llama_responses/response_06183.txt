Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of hours the trainers have to train the dolphins. There are 2 trainers and each trainer has to train the dolphins for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours is 2 x 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to divide the 6 hours equally among the 2 trainers. To do this, we can divide 6 by 2, which is the same as 3. So, each trainer will spend 3 hours training the dolphins.
