Let's start by identifying the given information.

We know that Cristine bought a dozen lemons, which is equal to 12.

Cristine gave 1/4 of the lemons to her neighbor, so she gave away 12 * 1/4 = 3 lemons.

So, to find the number of lemons Cristine has left, we need to subtract the lemons she gave away from the original amount of lemons she had.

12 - 3 = 9

Answer: 9
