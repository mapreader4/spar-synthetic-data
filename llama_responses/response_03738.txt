Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the original prices of the items:

* The backpack costs $50.
* The ring-binders cost $20 each, so 3 ring-binders would be 3 x $20 = $60.

The total cost of the original items would be $50 + $60 = $110.

Now, the price of the backpack increased by $5, so the new price of the backpack is $50 + $5 = $55.

The price of the ring-binders decreased by $2, so the new price of each ring-binder is $20 - $2 = $18. Since there are 3 ring-binders, the new total cost of the ring-binders is 3 x $18 = $54.

The new total cost of the backpack and ring-binders is $55 + $54 = $109.

So, the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store is:

Answer: $109
