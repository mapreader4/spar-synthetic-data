Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of buyers yesterday was x. Since it was half the number of buyers as the day before, we can write an equation: x = 50/2 = 25. So, yesterday, there were 25 buyers.

2. The day before yesterday had 50 buyers, so the total number of buyers in the three days is the sum of 25 + 50. 25 + 50 = 75.

Answer: 75
