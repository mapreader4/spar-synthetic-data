Let's start by identifying the information given to us.

Jairus read 20 pages of the newspaper. 
Arniel read 2 more than twice the number of pages Jairus read.

The number of pages Jairus read is 20. So, 2 more than twice the number of pages Jairus read will be 2 * 20 = 40. So, Arniel read 40 pages.

Jairus read 20 pages. Arniel read 40 pages.

To find the total number of pages they read, we add the number of pages Jairus read with the number of pages Arniel read: 
20 + 40 = 60.

Answer: 60
