Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of songs Kira downloaded. She downloaded 10 songs in the morning, and then she downloaded 15 more, so that is a total of 10 + 15 = 25 songs. Then, her friend recommended 3 more songs, so she downloaded a total of 25 + 3 = 28 songs.

Each song has a size of 5 MB, so to find the total size of the songs, we multiply the total number of songs by the size of a song. 28 songs times 5 MB is 28 * 5 = 140 MB.

Answer: 140
