Let's break this problem down step by step.

Phillip has a math test with 40 questions and he gets 75% of them right. To find the number of questions he gets right, we can multiply the total number of questions by the percentage of questions he gets right.

75% of 40 = 0.75 * 40 = 30

Phillip gets 30 out of 40 math questions right.

Phillip also has an English test with 50 questions and he gets 98% of them right. To find the number of questions he gets right, we can multiply the total number of questions by the percentage of questions he gets right.

98% of 50 = 0.98 * 50 = 49

Phillip gets 49 out of 50 English questions right.

Now, to find the total number of questions he gets right, we can add the number of questions he gets right in math and English.

30 + 49 = 79

Phillip gets a total of 79 questions right.
