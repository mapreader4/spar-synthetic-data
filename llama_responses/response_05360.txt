Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that each hamburger is 4 ounces. The winner ate 84 ounces last year. To beat last year's winner, Tonya needs to eat more ounces than 84. So, let's subtract 84 from the answer to find the number of hamburgers Tonya needs to eat.

84 - 84 =?

To make this easier, let's convert the problem into a subtraction problem. We know that 100 - 84 is 16. So, Tonya needs to eat 16 hamburgers to beat last year's winner.

Answer: 16
