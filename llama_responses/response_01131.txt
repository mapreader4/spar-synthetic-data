Let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of repairing one tire is $7.
2. For each tire, there is an additional 50 cents for sales tax.
3. Since there are 4 tires, the total cost for the tires is 4 x 7 = 28 dollars.
4. Then, we need to add the 50 cents for the sales tax for each tire. Since there are 4 tires, we multiply 50 cents by 4, which is 200 cents.
5. To get the total cost, we add the 28 dollars for the cost of the tires and the 200 cents for the sales tax. 28 + 0.2 = 28.20.

Answer: 28.20
