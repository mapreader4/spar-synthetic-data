Let's break this down step by step.

Mr. Jones has 6 shirts for every pair of pants. This means that for every pair of pants, he has 6 shirts. 

Let's say he has 40 pants. 

The number of shirts he has for all 40 pants is:

6 x 40 = 240

So, the total number of pieces of clothes he owns is 240.
