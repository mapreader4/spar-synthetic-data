Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the number of sharks he will see in 5 hours. Since he sees a shark every 10 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 5 hours into 60 minutes to get the number of sharks he will see:

5 hours * 60 minutes / 1 hour = 300 minutes

Now, since he sees a shark every 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of minutes by 10 to get the number of sharks he will see:

300 minutes / 10 = 30

So, he will see 30 sharks in 5 hours. Since he earns $15 for each shark, we can multiply the number of sharks by the amount he earns per shark:

30 sharks * $15 = $450

However, he will need to subtract the cost of the boat fuel from his total earnings:

$450 - $50 = $400

So, the profit he can expect to make in 5 hours is:

Answer: 400
