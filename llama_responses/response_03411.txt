Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Lara takes 7 minutes and 23 seconds to carry the backpack through the obstacle course and set it down on the other side. To convert this to seconds, we multiply the minutes by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute) and then add the seconds:

7 minutes x 60 = 420 seconds
420 seconds + 23 seconds = 443 seconds

So, it takes Lara 443 seconds to carry the backpack through the obstacle course.

Next, she takes 73 seconds to crank open the door to the obstacle course.

Then, she traverses the obstacle course again without the backpack and takes 5 minutes and 58 seconds. Again, we convert this to seconds:

5 minutes x 60 = 300 seconds
300 seconds + 58 seconds = 358 seconds

So, it takes Lara 358 seconds to traverse the obstacle course again without the backpack.

To find the total time it takes Lara to complete the obstacle course, we add up the time it takes her to carry the backpack, the time it takes her to open the door, and the time it takes her to traverse the obstacle course again:

443 seconds + 73 seconds + 358 seconds = 874 seconds

Answer: 874
