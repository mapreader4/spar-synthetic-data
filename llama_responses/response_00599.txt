Let's start by identifying the values of each type of currency:

* 4 quarters = 100 cents
* 3 dimes = 30 cents
* 1 nickel = 5 cents

We can add up the values of the quarters, dimes, and the nickel to find the total cost of the candy bar:
100 cents + 30 cents + 5 cents = 135 cents

Since John got 4 cents back in change, that means the total cost of the candy bar was:
135 cents - 4 cents = 131 cents

Answer: 131
