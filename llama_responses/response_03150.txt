Let's start by finding out how much money Percy needs to save.

Percy's goal is to save $500 for a new PlayStation. He already has $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas, so he needs to save the remaining amount.

$500 - $200 - $150 = $250

Percy needs to save $250.

Now, he's going to sell his old PlayStation games for $7.5 each. To find out how many games he needs to sell, we can divide the amount he needs to save by the price of each game:

$250 / $7.5 = 33

Percy needs to sell 33 games to reach his goal.

Answer: 33
