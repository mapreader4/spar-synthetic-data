Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of boxes she sold on Saturday be x. Then, the number of boxes she sold on Sunday is 50% more than the number of boxes she sold on Saturday. So, the number of boxes she sold on Sunday is x + 0.5x.

The total number of boxes she sold on both days is 150. We can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 0.5x) = 150

We can combine like terms:

x + 1.5x = 150

To solve for x, we can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:

x = (150 - 1) / 1.5

x = 100

So, she sold 100 boxes on Saturday.
