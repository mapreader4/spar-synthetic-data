Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chastity made 12 angel food cakes initially.
2. She placed the cakes in boxes, so there are 12 cakes in total.
3. Half of the stack of cakes was knocked over by the crow, which means 6 cakes fell.
4. Chastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which means she picked up 3 cakes.
5. The rest of the fallen cakes were destroyed, which means 3 cakes were destroyed.

Answer: 3
