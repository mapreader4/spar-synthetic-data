Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by letting m be the number of miles Michelle drives.

Since Michelle drives 20 miles less than Tracy, we know that Michelle drives 20 less than Tracy's distance, so we can set up an equation:

Tracy's distance = 2 * m + 20

We know that Tracy drives 20 more than Michelle, so we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to get:

Tracy's distance - 20 = 2 * m

Now, we know that the total distance of the trip is 1000 miles. 1000 is the sum of the distances of all three people. We can set up an equation:

2 * m + 20 + 3 * m = 1000

Now, we can solve for m. First, we'll subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

2 * m = 1000 - 20

2 * m = 980

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

m = 490

So, Michelle drives 490 miles.
