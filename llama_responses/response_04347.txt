Let's break it down step by step.

Braelynn has 24 knives initially.

She has twice as many teaspoons as knives, which means she has 24 * 2 = 48 teaspoons.

She buys 1/3 as many additional knives, which means she buys 24 * 1/3 = 8 knives. So, she now has 24 + 8 = 32 knives.

She buys 2/3 as many additional teaspoons, which means she buys 48 * 2/3 = 32 teaspoons. So, she now has 48 + 32 = 80 teaspoons.

The total number of cutlery pieces she has in her kitchen is the sum of the number of knives and the number of teaspoons: 32 + 80 = 112.

Answer: 112
