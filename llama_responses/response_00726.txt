Let's think step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that Jed is 10 years older than Matt, and that in 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old.

Let's think about the present age of Jed. If Jed will be 25 years old in 10 years, then his present age must be 15 years. So, Jed is currently 15 years old.

Now, we need to find the present age of Matt. Since Jed is 10 years older than Matt, and Jed is 15 years old, Matt must be 5 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages. The sum of their ages is 15 + 5 = 20.
