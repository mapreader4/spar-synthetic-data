Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Nigella earns a base salary of $3,000 a month plus a 2% commission on every house she sells. We know that she earns $8,000 total, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

3,000 + 2% of total house value = 8,000

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 100 to get rid of the percentage:

3,000 + 0.02(total house value) = 8,000 * 100

This becomes:

3000 + 0.02x = 8000

Subtract 3000 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable:

0.02x = 5000

Divide both sides by 0.02 to solve for x:

x = 250,000

Now we know that the total value of the houses is $250,000. We are also given that House B costs three times as much as House A, and House C costs twice as much as House A minus $110,000. Let's use these relationships to find the value of House A.

Let's say the value of House A is x. Then, the value of House B is 3x, and the value of House C is 2x - 110,000.

We know that the total value of the houses is $250,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (2x - 110,000) = 250,000

Combine like terms:

4x - 110,000 = 250,000

Add 110,000 to both sides to get:

4x = 360,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 90,000

So House A costs $90,000.
