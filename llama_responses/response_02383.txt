Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's start by identifying the amount of money that Raquel has. Raquel has $40.
2. Since Nataly has three times as much money as Raquel, we can multiply Raquel's amount by 3 to find out how much money Nataly has. 3 x 40 = 120.
3. Tom has a quarter as much money as Nataly. So, if Nataly has 120, Tom must have 120/4 = 30.
4. Now, we add up the money of Tom, Raquel, and Nataly: 30 + 40 + 120 = 190.

Answer: 190
