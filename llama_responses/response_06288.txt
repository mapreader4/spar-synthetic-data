Let's break this problem down step by step.

Alice starts with 27 plates, and then she adds 37 more plates. This is a total of 27 + 37 = 64 plates. The tower falls when she adds more plates, but before it falls, she adds x more plates. The total number of plates is 83. So, we need to find out how many plates she added before the tower fell. We know that the total number of plates is 83, and we know that she added 64 plates initially. To find out how many more plates she added, we can subtract 64 from 83, which is 83 - 64 = 19.

Answer: 19
