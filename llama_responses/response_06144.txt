Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say there are 20 kids in preschool, and 1/2 of them fall asleep within the first 5 minutes. That means 10 kids fall asleep in the first 5 minutes. 

Then, half of the kids remaining fall asleep within another 5 minutes. This means that half of the 10 kids who did not fall asleep in the first 5 minutes will fall asleep in the next 5 minutes. 

So, half of 10 is 5 kids. So, 5 kids are still awake. 

Answer: 5
