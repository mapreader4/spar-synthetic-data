Let's break it down step by step.

During the school week, Daniel practices basketball for 15 minutes each day. There are 5 days in a school week. So, during the school week, Daniel practices basketball for 15 * 5 = 75 minutes.

On the weekend, Daniel practices basketball for twice as long each day, so that's 30 minutes. There are 2 days in a weekend. So, during the weekend, Daniel practices basketball for 30 * 2 = 60 minutes.

To find the total minutes Daniel practices during a whole week, we add the minutes from the school week and the weekend:

75 + 60 = 135

Answer: 135
