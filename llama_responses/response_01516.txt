Let's break it down step by step.

Lucille has 3000 as her revenue. She has to divide this into two parts, one for employee salaries and one for stock purchases. The ratio is 4:11, which means that 4 parts of the 3000 revenue will go towards employee salaries and 11 parts will go towards stock purchases.

Let's convert the ratio into a fraction: 4/11 = 4/11. This means that 4 parts of 3000 will go towards employee salaries. To find the amount, we can multiply 3000 by 4/11:

3000 * 4/11 = 1200

So, Lucille spends 1200 on employee salaries.
