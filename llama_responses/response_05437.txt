Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of the 4 pack of sliced meat. The cost is given as $40.00.

Then, let's find the cost of rush delivery. The cost of rush delivery is 30% of the original cost. To find the cost of rush delivery, we can multiply the original cost by 1.3. So, the cost of rush delivery is 1.3 * 40.00 = 52.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the sliced meat to the cost of rush delivery. The total cost is 40.00 + 52.00 = 92.00.

So, the answer is: Answer: 92
