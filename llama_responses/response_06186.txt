Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Tom is 32 years old 5 years ago. This means Tom's age 5 years ago was 27 years. We also know that Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age 5 years ago, so Jim's age 5 years ago was 27 + 5 = 32. This means that Jim is 32 years old 5 years ago, which is the same age as Tom. Now we know that Jim's age 5 years ago was 32. To find Jim's age in 2 years, we need to add 2 to 32, which is 34. 

Answer: 34
