Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of slices of cheesecake pie. Each pie is cut into 6 slices, so if she sells 7 pies, she will have a total of 7 x 6 = 42 slices.

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes. Each slice is $7, so if she makes 42 slices, she makes 7 x 7 = 49 dollars.

Answer: 49
