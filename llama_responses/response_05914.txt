Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: We know that Salaria has 50% of tree A and 50% of tree B. So, we can find the total number of trees Salaria has by multiplying 50% by 2, which is 100.

Step 2: Tree A gives her 10 oranges a month and 60% are good. So, we can find the total number of good oranges from tree A in a month by multiplying 10 by 0.6, which is 6.

Step 3: Tree B gives her 15 oranges and 1/3 are good. So, we can find the total number of good oranges from tree B in a month by multiplying 15 by 1/3, which is 5.

Step 4: Salaria gets 55 good oranges per month. So, we can find the total number of good oranges Salaria gets in a month by multiplying 6 (from tree A) + 5 (from tree B), which is 11.

Step 5: We want to find the total number of trees Salaria has. We know that Salaria has 100 trees, and we know that 55 good oranges per month is equal to 11. So, we can divide 100 by 11 to find the total number of trees Salaria has, which is 9.
