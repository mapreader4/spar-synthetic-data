To find the total cost of the stove and the damage to the wall, we can add the cost of the stove and the cost of the damage to the wall.

The cost of the stove is $1200. The cost of the damage to the wall is 1/6th of that amount, so the cost of the damage is 1200 / 6 = 200.

The total cost is 1200 + 200 = 1400.

Answer: 1400
