Let's start by finding out how many books Boris has left. Boris donates a fourth of his 24 books, which is 24 / 4 = 6 books. So, Boris has 24 - 6 = 18 books left.

Cameron has 30 books and donates a third of his books. A third of 30 is 30 / 3 = 10 books. So, Cameron has 30 - 10 = 20 books left.

Now, let's find the total number of books Boris and Cameron have. Boris has 18 books and Cameron has 20 books. Boris and Cameron have 18 + 20 = 38 books together.
