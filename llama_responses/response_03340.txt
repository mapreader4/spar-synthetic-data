Let us denote Sammy's score as x. Since Sammy scored 20 points, and Gab scored twice as many points, Gab scored 2x points. Cher scored twice as many points as Gab, so Cher scored 2(2x) = 4x points. The total number of points is 20 + 2(2x) = 20 + 4x = 20 + 4x = 4x + 20. The question asks how many more points they have than their opponent. The opponent's points are unknown. So, we want to find the difference between the total points of the team and the opponent's points. The difference is 20 + 4x - opponent's points. Since we do not know the opponent's points, we can let it be represented as x. We can write it as 20 + 4x - x. To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation. 20 + 4x - x = 20 + 4x - x. We can add 20 to both sides of the equation to get 20 + 4x = 20 + 4x - x + x. Then we can subtract x from both sides to get 20 = 4x. The value of x is 5. So, the difference between their points and the opponent's points is 20 + 4(5) = 20 + 20 = 40. The answer is 40. Answer: 40
