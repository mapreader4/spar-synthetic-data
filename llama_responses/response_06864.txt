Let's start by identifying the number of paper cups that were used. We know that there were 2-dozen paper cups in each set, so the total number of paper cups is 2 x 12 = 24. 5 cups were damaged, so 5 cups were not used. Since 30 cups were not used, 30 cups were left unused. We subtract 5 cups from the total number of cups to get the number of cups that were actually used. 24 - 5 = 19 cups were used.
