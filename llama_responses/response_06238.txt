Let's break down the expenses:

* 3 people watched the movie: 3 x $7 = $21
* 2 boxes of popcorn: 2 x $1.5 = $3
* 3 cups of milk tea: 3 x $3 = $9

Total expenses: $21 + $3 + $9 = $33

To split the expenses, we need to divide $33 by 3:

$33 รท 3 = $11

So each person should contribute $11.
