Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find the number of cans Peter needs. Peter needs 80 ounces of soda, and each can is 8 oz, so he needs 80 / 8 = 10 cans.

Now, we know that each can costs $.5, so we multiply the number of cans by the cost per can: 10 *.5 = 5.

So, Peter will spend 5 dollars on soda.
