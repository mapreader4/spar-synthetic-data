Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of grasshoppers Jemma found initially. She found 7 grasshoppers.

Then, she found 2 dozen baby grasshoppers. To convert the number of baby grasshoppers to a numerical value, we can multiply 2 by 12 (since 12 is the number of grasshoppers in a dozen). So, Jemma found 2 x 12 = 24 baby grasshoppers.

Now, let's add the number of grasshoppers Jemma found initially with the number of baby grasshoppers. 7 + 24 = 31.

Answer: 31
