Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Matt rode his bike a total of 1000 feet.  He passed a stop sign that was 350 feet away from his house.  He rode an additional 275 feet after passing the second sign.

Let's find the distance between the first and second signs.  The first sign is 350 feet away from the house.  The second sign is 350 + 275 = 625 feet away from the house.  So, the distance between the first and second signs is 625 - 350 = 275 feet.

Answer: 275
