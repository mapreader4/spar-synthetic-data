Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of dogs that are running. We are told that 12 dogs are running. Let's set that aside.

Next, we are told that half of the dogs are playing with toys. To find half of the dogs, we can multiply the total number of dogs (88) by 0.5. 0.5 * 88 = 44. So, 44 dogs are playing with toys.

Next, we are told that a fourth of the dogs are barking. To find a fourth of the dogs, we can multiply the total number of dogs (88) by 0.25. 0.25 * 88 = 22. So, 22 dogs are barking.

Now, let's subtract the number of dogs that are playing with toys (44) and the number of dogs that are barking (22) from the total number of dogs (88). 44 - 22 = 26. Therefore, 26 dogs are not doing anything.

Answer: 26
