Let's break it down step by step.

Randy had $3,000 initially. Then, he received $200 from Smith, so he now has $3,200.

Then, Randy gave $1,200 to Sally. This means that he subtracted $1,200 from his total, leaving him with:

$3,200 - $1,200 = $1,000

So, the value of the rest is $1,000.

Answer: 1000
