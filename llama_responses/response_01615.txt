Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many bars of soap Elias uses in one year. If he uses a bar of soap every month, then in one year, he will use 12 bars. 

Next, let's find out how many bars of soap he will use in two years. Since there are 2 years, he will use 24 bars of soap.

Now, let's multiply the number of bars of soap he uses in one year by the cost of one bar of soap. The cost of one bar of soap is $4. So, we multiply 24 by 4 to find the total cost:

24 * 4 = 96

Answer: 96
