Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first identify the number of women. We know that half of the total number of guests are women, which is 50 / 2 = 25.

Next, let's identify the number of men. We know that 15 are men, so that's the total number of men.

Now, let's identify the number of children. We know that the rest of the guests, after subtracting the number of women and the number of men, are children. So, 50 - 25 - 15 = 10.

Now, let's find the number of people who stayed. We know that 1/5 of the men left, and 4 children left. So, the number of men who stayed is 15 - 1/5 * 15 = 12.

And the number of children who stayed is 10.

Answer: 12
