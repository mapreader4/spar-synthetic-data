To find the number of pens left for Lenny, we can start by finding the total number of pens Lenny had initially.

Lenny had 20 boxes of pens, and each box contains 5 pens, so the total number of pens Lenny had is:

20 * 5 = 100

Lenny gave 40% of the pens to her close friends, which is 0.4 * 100 = 40 pens.

Lenny gave one-fourth of the remaining pens to her classmates. To find this, we need to find one-fourth of 60 pens. To find one-fourth of 60 pens, we multiply 60 by 1/4, which is 15.

So, Lenny gave 40 pens to her friends and 15 pens to her classmates. So, we need to subtract 40 + 15 from the initial 100 pens to find the number of pens left for Lenny.

100 - 40 - 15 = 45

Answer: 45
