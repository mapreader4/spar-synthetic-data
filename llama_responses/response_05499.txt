Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Grayson drives for 1 hour at 25 mph, so he goes 25 miles.
2. Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 20 mph. To find the distance he goes during this time, we can multiply 0.5 hours by 20 mph, which gives us 10 miles.
3. So, Grayson goes a total of 25 + 10 = 35 miles in his motorboat.
4. Rudy rows for 3 hours at 10 mph. To find the distance he goes during this time, we can multiply 3 hours by 10 mph, which gives us 30 miles.
5. So, Rudy goes 30 miles.
6. To find the difference in the distance between Grayson and Rudy, we subtract 30 miles (Rudy's distance) from 35 miles (Grayson's distance). 35 - 30 = 5.
