To find the average number of hours Brady worked per month, we need to find the total number of hours he worked in those 3 months and then divide it by 3.

The total number of hours Brady worked in those 3 months is:

6 hours/day * 1 (April) + 5 hours/day * 1 (June) + 8 hours/day * 1 (September) = 6 + 5 + 8 = 19

To find the average, we divide the total number of hours by 3:

19 / 3 = 6.33

Answer: 6.33
