To find out how much Simon must spend, we need to find out how much each kabob stick costs. We know that a slab of beef that can be cut into 80 cubes costs $25. So, each cube of beef costs $25 / 80 = $0.3125.

We know that a kabob stick has 4 cubes of beef. So, each kabob stick costs 4 x $0.3125 = $1.25.

Simon needs to make 40 kabob sticks. To find out how much Simon must spend, we need to multiply the cost of each kabob stick by the number of kabob sticks he needs. 40 kabob sticks x $1.25 = $50.
