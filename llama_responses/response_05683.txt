Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that the total distance ran by the four runners is 195 miles.

We know that Katarina ran 51 miles. Since Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet ran the same distance, we can let's subtract 51 from 195 to find the distance Harriet ran.

51 miles from 195 is equal to 144.
