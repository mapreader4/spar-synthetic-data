Let's break this down step by step.

We know that Gary has 30 grams of gold that cost $15 per gram. To find the cost of Gary's gold, we can multiply the number of grams by the cost per gram:

30 grams x $15 per gram = $450

So, Gary's gold costs $450.

Anna has 50 grams of gold for the cost of $20 per gram. To find the cost of Anna's gold, we can multiply the number of grams by the cost per gram:

50 grams x $20 per gram = $1000

So, Anna's gold costs $1000.

To find the cost of their combined gold, we can add the cost of Gary's gold to the cost of Anna's gold:

$450 + $1000 = $1450

So, the cost of their combined gold is $1450.
