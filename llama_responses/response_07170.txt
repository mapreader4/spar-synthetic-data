Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the number of books Monica read last year, which is 16.

This year, she read twice the number of books she read last year, so she read 16 x 2 = 32 books.

Next year, she wants to read 5 more than twice the number of books she read this year, which is 32. So, she will read 32 + 5 = 37 books.

Answer: 37
