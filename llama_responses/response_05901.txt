Let's break it down step by step.

Janet needs 5 tickets to ride the roller coaster, and she needs 3 tickets to ride the giant slide. So, she needs a total of 8 tickets.

To ride the roller coaster 7 times, she will need 7 x 1 = 7 tickets. To ride the giant slide 4 times, she will need 4 x 1 = 4 tickets.
