Let's break down the information given:

Charlie owns:
- 1 flute
- 2 horns
- 1 harp

Carli owns:
- 2 x 1 = 2 flutes (since Carli has twice as many flutes as Charlie)
- 1/2 x 2 = 1 horns (since Carli has half as many horns as Charlie)
- 0 harps (Carli has no harps)

To find the combined total, we add the number of instruments owned by Charlie and Carli:

1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Answer: 4
