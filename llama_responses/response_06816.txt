Let's break it down step by step.

Harry takes 15 minutes to buy coffee and a bagel, so that's 15 minutes.

He takes twice that long to read the paper and eat, which is 2 times 15 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

So, the total time it takes Harry to do his morning routine is 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.
