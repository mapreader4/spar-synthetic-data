Let's break this down step by step.

Bill has 16 gallons of milk. He turns 1/4 of it into sour cream, which is 4 gallons. He turns 1/4 of it into butter, which is also 4 gallons. That leaves 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 gallons of milk for whole milk.

To make 1 gallon of butter, it takes 4 gallons of milk, so he can make 1 gallon of butter with 4 gallons of milk. Since he has 4 gallons of milk, he can make 1 gallon of butter. To make 1 gallon of sour cream, it takes 2 gallons of milk, so he can make 2 gallons of sour cream with 4 gallons of milk.

He sells the butter for $5/gallon, so he makes 5 x 1 = 5 dollars from the butter. He sells the sour cream for $6/gallon, so he makes 6 x 2 = 12 dollars from the sour cream. He sells the whole milk for $3/gallon, so he makes 3 x 8 = 24 dollars from the whole milk.

Adding all of these up, he makes 5 + 12 + 24 = 41 dollars.

Answer: 41
