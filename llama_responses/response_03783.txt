Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of doughnuts each type of doughnut that Bryce is bringing:

* Chocolate doughnuts: 10 kids want chocolate doughnuts
* Glazed doughnuts: 15 kids want glazed doughnuts

The total number of doughnuts is the sum of the number of chocolate doughnuts and glazed doughnuts, which is:

10 + 15 = 25

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the doughnuts. The chocolate doughnuts cost $2 each, so the total cost of the chocolate doughnuts is:

10 x $2 = $20

The glazed doughnuts cost $1 each, so the total cost of the glazed doughnuts is:

15 x $1 = $15

The total cost of all the doughnuts is the sum of the cost of the chocolate doughnuts and glazed doughnuts:

$20 + $15 = $35

Answer: 35
