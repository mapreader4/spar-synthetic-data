Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Southton buries their time capsule 15 feet underground.
* Northton buries their time capsule 12 feet higher than 4 times the depth of the Southton time capsule.

Let's denote the depth of the Southton time capsule as x. Then, we know that Northton buries their time capsule 12 feet higher than 4 times x, so we can set up the equation:

12 = 4x + x

We can solve for x by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

x = (12 - 12) / 4
x = 3

So, the depth of the Southton time capsule is 3 feet. Now, we can find the depth of the Northton time capsule by adding 4 times the depth of the Southton time capsule to 3:

Northton buries their time capsule 4 * 3 = 12 feet underground.

Answer: 12
