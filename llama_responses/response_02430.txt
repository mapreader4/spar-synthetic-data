Let's break it down step by step.

Whitney bought 9 books about whales and 7 books about fish, so she bought a total of 9 + 7 = 16 items. Each book cost $11 and each magazine cost $1, so the total cost of the books and magazines is 9 * 11 + 7 * 1. 

9 * 11 = 99 and 7 * 1 = 7, so the total cost is 99 + 7 = 106.

So, Whitney spent 106 dollars.

Answer: 106
