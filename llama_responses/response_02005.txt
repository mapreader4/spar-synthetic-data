Let's break this down step by step.

1. Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, which means she sold 9 cups (since half of the total amount).

2. Then she sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. So, she sold a total of 18 + 9 = 27 cups.

3. She gave away half of that to her friends, which is half of 27, which is 13.5 cups.

4. She drank the last cup of lemonade herself, which is 1 cup.

So, in total, Hazel made 27 + 13.5 + 1 = 41.5 cups of lemonade. However, since she made whole cups of lemonade, not half cups, we need to multiply 41.5 by 2 to get the total amount of cups. 41.5 * 2 = 83.

Answer: 83
