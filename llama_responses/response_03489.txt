Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of pages Enrique needs to shred: 132.

Since Enrique's paper shredder can only shred 6 pages at a time, we can divide the total number of pages by 6 to find out how many times he needs to shred:

132 รท 6 = 22

So Enrique will need to shred 22 times to shred all 132 pages.
