Let's start by using the information that Remy sold 55 bottles of soda in the morning. Let's call the number of bottles sold in the evening as x. Since Nick sold six fewer bottles than Remy, we can set up an equation: x = 55 - 6.

Next, we know that the price per bottle is $.50, so the total amount of money earned in the morning is 55 *.50 = $27.50.

In the evening, they earned a total of $55. To find out how much more they earned in the evening than in the morning, we subtract the morning earnings from the evening earnings: $55 - $27.50 = $27.50.

So, the answer is: Answer: 27.50.
