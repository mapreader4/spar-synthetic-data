Let's break it down step by step.

Boris has 100 pieces of Halloween candy initially.

He eats 8 pieces of candy, so he is left with 100 - 8 = 92 pieces of candy.

He separates the 92 pieces of candy into 4 equal portions into 4 different bowls. So, 92 / 4 = 23 pieces of candy are in each bowl.

Then, he takes away 3 pieces of candy from each bowl to keep for himself. So, he takes 3 * 4 = 12 pieces of candy for himself.

So, each bowl has 23 - 12 = 11 pieces of candy left.
