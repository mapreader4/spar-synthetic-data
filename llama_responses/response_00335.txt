Let's break down the items Eve wants to buy:

1. Hand mitts: $14.00
2. Apron: $16.00
3. Set of 3 cooking utensils: $10.00
4. Small knife: 2 x $10.00 = $20.00

Total cost without the 25% off sale: $14.00 + $16.00 + $10.00 + $20.00 = $40.00

To find the 25% off sale, we need to multiply the total cost by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%). So, 0.75 x $40.00 = $30.00

Answer: 30
