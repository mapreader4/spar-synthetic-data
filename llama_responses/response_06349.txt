Let's start by identifying the number of houses. Isabella has 3 times as many green houses as yellow houses. This means that if she has 90 green houses, then she also has 90 yellow houses.

We know that she has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. This means that if she has 90 yellow houses, she has 50 red houses.

Now, we can add the number of green houses to the number of yellow houses to get the total number of houses. 90 + 50 = 140.

Since we know that the total number of houses is 140, we can subtract the number of green houses to find the number of houses that are not yellow. 140 - 90 = 50.

Answer: 50
