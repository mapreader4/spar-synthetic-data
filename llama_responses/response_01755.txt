Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Find the total distance he needs to travel.
The total distance John needs to travel is 150 miles.

Step 2: Find the distance he actually traveled.
The distance he actually traveled is 50 miles.

Step 3: Find the distance he still needs to travel.
The distance he still needs to travel is 150 - 50 = 100 miles.

Step 4: Find the time he needs to travel that distance.
The time he needs to travel that distance is 100 miles at a constant speed of 3 hours per 50 miles. So, we can set up a proportion to solve for time.

Step 5: Solve for the time.
The time he needs to travel the remaining distance is 100 miles at a rate of 3 hours per 50 miles. We can set up a proportion to solve for time.

Step 6: Solve for the time.
The time he needs to travel the remaining distance is 100 miles at a rate of 3 hours per 50 miles is 100 / 50 = 2 hours.
