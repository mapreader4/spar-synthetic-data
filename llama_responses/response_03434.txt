Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lucy had 500g of flour at the start. She used 240g of flour to bake cookies. So, we need to find out how much flour was left.

To find the amount of flour left, we can subtract the flour used (240g) from the initial amount of flour (500g).

500g - 240g = 260g

So, Lucy needs 260g of flour to buy to have a full bag of flour.
