Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of refrigerators produced per hour.

90 refrigerators per hour are produced, and 70 more coolers than refrigerators are produced per hour. So, the number of coolers produced per hour is 90 + 70 = 160.

Now, the factory works for 9 hours a day. So, the number of refrigerators produced per day is 160 * 9 = 1440.

Now, the factory works for 5 days. So, the total number of refrigerators produced is 1440 * 5 = 7200.

Answer: 7200
