Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find the number of time-outs for running, which is 5. Then, we need to find the number of time-outs for throwing food, which is 1 less than 5, which is 4. Then, we need to find the number of food-throwing time-outs, which is 1/3 of the number of food-throwing time-outs, which is 1/3 of 4, which is 4/3.

So, the total number of time-outs is 5 + 4 + 4/3 = 5 + 4 + 1.33 = 9.33.

Answer: 9.33
