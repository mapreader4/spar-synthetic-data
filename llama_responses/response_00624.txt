Let's break this down step by step:

Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery.
Lorene has 3 times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia, so she has 3 x 25 = 75 pieces of stationery.

To find the difference between the two, we can subtract 25 from 75:
75 - 25 = 50.

So, Georgia has 50 fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene.
