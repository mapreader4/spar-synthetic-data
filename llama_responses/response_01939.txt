Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that Jerome has half of his money, which is $43. We also know that he gave $8 to Meg and three times as much to Bianca. So, to find out how much he gave to Bianca, we multiply $8 by 3, which gives us $24. Then, we subtract this from the total amount he gave away, which is $8 + $24 = $32. Now, we subtract this from the initial amount he had, which is $43, to find the amount he has left. So, Jerome has $43 - $32 = $11 left.
