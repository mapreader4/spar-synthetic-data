Let's break this down step by step.

Jim finds a treasure chest with 100 gold coins in it.  This means the total amount of gold is 100.

He also finds 2 smaller bags that have half as much gold each.  Half of 100 is 50, so the total amount of gold in these bags is 2 x 50 = 100.

So, in total, Jim finds 100 + 100 = 200 gold coins.

He spends 8 hours scuba diving.  So, to find the amount of gold per hour, we divide the total amount of gold found by the time spent diving.

200 gold coins / 8 hours = 25 gold coins per hour.

Answer: 25
