Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's start by identifying the speeds of the three snails:

1. The first snail travels at a speed of 2 feet per minute.
2. The second snail travels at twice the speed of the first snail, which is 2 x 2 = 4 feet per minute.
3. The third snail travels at five times the speed of the second snail, which is 4 x 5 = 20 feet per minute.

Now, let's find the distance traveled by the first snail in 20 minutes:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 2 feet/minute x 20 minutes
= 40 feet

Since the third snail travels at 20 feet per minute, we can find the time it takes for the third snail to travel the same distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 40 feet / 20 feet/minute
= 2 minutes

So, it took the third snail 2 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk.
