Let's break down the time Mark spends on each activity:

1. Parking: 5 minutes
2. Walking to the courthouse: 3 minutes
3. Going through the metal detector: 30 minutes
4. Going through the metal detector on less crowded days: 10 minutes

We know that there are 5 workdays in a week, and 2 of those days are 30 minutes and 3 days are 10 minutes. So, we can add the time for these days:

30 + 30 + 10 = 70

The other 2 days, which are 3 minutes each, are added to this total:

70 + 6 = 76

So, Mark spends 76 minutes on all these activities in a week with 5 workdays.
