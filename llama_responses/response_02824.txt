Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate how many tacos they can make with 100 pounds of beef.

1. 100 pounds of beef is the total amount of beef.
2. Each taco uses.25 pounds of beef. To find the number of tacos they can make, we can divide 100 pounds of beef by.25 pounds per taco.

100 pounds /.25 pounds per taco = 400 tacos

So, they can make 400 tacos.

Now, let's calculate how much it costs to make each taco.

Each taco takes $1.5 to make, so the total cost of making 400 tacos would be:

400 tacos * $1.5 per taco = $600

Now, let's calculate the profit.

The total revenue from selling 400 tacos would be:

400 tacos * $2 per taco = $800

The cost of making the tacos is $600, and the revenue from selling them is $800. So, the profit would be:

$800 - $600 = $200

Answer: 200
