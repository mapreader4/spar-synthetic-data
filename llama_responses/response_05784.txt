To solve this problem, we will first find the total cost of the items that Jay purchased. The cost of the book is 25 dollars, the cost of the pen is 4 dollars, and the cost of the ruler is 1 dollar. So the total cost of the items is 25 + 4 + 1 = 30 dollars. Jay paid with a 50-dollar bill. So, Jay got 50 - 30 dollars as change. Answer: 20.
