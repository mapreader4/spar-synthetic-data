Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Ned can run up one flight of stairs in 11 seconds, so to reach the top floor with 20 flights of stairs, he will need:

20 flights of stairs / 1 flight of stairs per 11 seconds = 20 * 11 = 220 seconds

This means Ned will take 220 seconds to reach the top floor.

2. Ned has already spent 165 seconds running up the stairs, so when he reaches the top floor, the remaining time on the timer will be:

72 seconds (initial time left on the timer) - 165 seconds (time Ned has spent) = 7 seconds

Answer: 7
