Let's break this down step by step.

Let's let x be the number of packages the courier received today.

The courier received 80 packages yesterday, so that is the total number of packages received. And today, the number of packages is twice as much, so it is 2x.

The total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow is the total of the number of packages received yesterday and today, which is 80 + 2x.

80 + 2x = 80 + 2*2 = 80 + 4 = 84

Answer: 84
