Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Tim knows x words originally. After 2 years, he knows x + 50% more words. The problem states that the book has increased the number of words he knows by 50%. This means that the number of words he knows after 2 years is x + 50% of x.

We know that the number of words he knows after 2 years is x + 50% of x. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + 50% of x = x + 50x

We can simplify the right side of the equation to:

x + 0.5x

Now we can solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 0.5x from both sides of the equation:

x + 0.5x = x

This gives us:

0.5x = 0

x = 0.5x

x = 0.5

So, the original number of words Tim knew is 0.5.
