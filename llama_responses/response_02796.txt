Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by identifying the number of friends who are boys. Since 60% of Julian's friends are boys, and 40% are girls, we can find the number of boys by multiplying 60% of 80 by 100.

60% of 80 is 48.

Since Boyd has twice as many friends who are girls as boys, and 48 boys, then the number of girls is 24.

Boyd has 24 girls and 48 boys. The total number of friends is 72.

To find the percentage of boys, we can divide 48 by 72 and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

48 รท 72 = 66.67%

Answer: 75
