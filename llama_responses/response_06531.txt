Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of logs the cookfire has at the beginning. It has 6 logs initially.

After one hour, the cookfire burns 3 logs, so it will have 6 - 3 = 3 logs left.

After two hours, the cookfire gets 2 more logs added to it, so it will have 3 + 2 = 5 logs.

After three hours, the cookfire burns 3 logs, so it will have 5 - 3 = 2 logs left.

Therefore, after 3 hours, the cookfire will have 2 logs left.
