Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total number of puppies that were born.

The two dogs had 2 puppies each, so the total number of puppies is 2 x 10 = 20.

After selling 3/4 of the puppies, we need to find 3/4 of 20, which is 15 puppies.

Each puppy was sold for $200, so the total amount of money received is 15 x $200 = $3000.

So, the answer is: Answer: 3000
