Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount that Tony and Esther will split among themselves. The total amount is $50, and they will split it 50/50, so each will get $25.

Moses will take 40% of the total amount, which is 0.4 x $50 = $20.

So, Esther will get $25, and Moses will get $20. The difference is $5. So, Moses will get $5 more than Esther.
