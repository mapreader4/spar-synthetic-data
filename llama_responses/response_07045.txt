Let's break down the information given to us:

* Jackson spends 2 hours vacuuming, which is 2 x 5 = 10 dollars.
* Jackson spends 0.5 hours washing dishes, which is 0.5 x 5 = 2.5 dollars.
* Jackson spends 3 times as long cleaning the bathroom, which is 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.

Adding all of these up, Jackson earns a total of 10 + 2.5 + 15 = 27 dollars.
