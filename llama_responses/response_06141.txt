To find the total amount of money Mallory spent on food, we need to first find the total cost of the fuel she used. The cost of filling the car fuel tank is $45, and the distance she traveled was 2000 miles. Since the car can travel 500 miles on a full tank, we can divide the total distance by 500 to find the number of times she had to fill up the tank, which is 4. So, the total cost of fuel is 4 x 45 = 180. If she used 3/5 times as much money on food as she spent on filling the car fuel tank for the whole journey, then she used 180 * 3/5 = 108 on food.
