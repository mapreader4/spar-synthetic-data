Let's start by using the information given. Let's first find out how many cows Aaron has. Since Aaron has 4 times as many cows as Matthews, and Matthews has 60 cows, we know that Aaron has 4 * 60 = 240 cows.

Now, let's find the total number of cows that Aaron and Matthews have together. We know that Matthews has 60 cows, and Aaron has 240 cows. So, to find the total number of cows they have together, we add the number of cows they each have, which is 60 + 240 = 300.

So, the answer is: Answer: 300.
