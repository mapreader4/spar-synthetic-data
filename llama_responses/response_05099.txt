Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "They got 20 more cats than dogs."

We can translate this to "20 more cats than dogs" as 20 - 0 = 20, because if they have 20 more cats than dogs, then the number of cats must be 20 more than the number of dogs.

So, the number of cats is 20.
