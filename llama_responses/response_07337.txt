Let's break this down step by step.

At the first intersection, there are 40 road signs.

At the second intersection, there are 1/4 more road signs than the first intersection. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, the number of road signs at the second intersection is 40 + 10 = 50.

At the third intersection, the number of road signs is twice the number at the second intersection. So, 50 * 2 = 100.

At the fourth intersection, the number of road signs is 20 fewer than those at the third intersection. So, 100 - 20 = 80.

To find the total number of road signs at the four intersections, we add up the number of road signs at each intersection:

40 + 50 + 100 + 80 = 270

Answer: 270
