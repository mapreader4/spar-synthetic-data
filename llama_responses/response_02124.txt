Let's break it down step by step.

James earns 10 dollars per week. For four weeks, he earns 4 x 10 = 40 dollars. He then spends half of that, which is 40 / 2 = 20 dollars, on a new video game. So he has 40 - 20 = 20 dollars left. Then, he spends a quarter of what is left, which is 20 / 4 = 5 dollars, on a new book. So, he has 20 - 5 = 15 dollars left.
