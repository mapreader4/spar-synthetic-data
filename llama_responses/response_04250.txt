Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's identify the information given: 
- The teacher wants to find four friends to help her carry some chairs to the school hall.
- Each student carried 5 chairs per trip.
- The total number of trips is 10.

To find the total number of chairs taken to the hall, we can multiply the number of chairs carried per trip by the number of trips:

5 chairs per trip * 10 trips = 5 * 10 = 50 chairs

So, the total number of chairs taken to the hall is 50.

Answer: 50
