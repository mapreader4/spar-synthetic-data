Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's break it down. Matthew scored 9 points. 9 points can be broken down into 3 points. 3 points are awarded for each basket. So Matthew made 3 baskets.

Shawn scored 6 points. 6 points can also be broken down into 2 baskets. 2 baskets are worth 3 points each. So Shawn made 2 baskets.

The total number of baskets made during this game is 3 + 2 = 5. So the answer is:

Answer: 5
