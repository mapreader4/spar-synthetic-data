Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of money Tiffany has left after playing two games:

2 games x $1 per game = $2

Tiffany has $3 initially, so she has $1 left over.

Now, let's find the maximum number of points she can get in the third game. She has 1 dollar left, and each play costs $1, so she can play only one more game.

In that game, she can get:

* 4 red buckets x 2 points each = 8 points
* 5 green buckets x 3 points each = 15 points

Total points = 8 + 15 = 23 points

But, she can't play more than one game, so the maximum points she can get is 23 points.

Answer: 23
