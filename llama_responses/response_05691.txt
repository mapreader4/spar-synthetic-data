Let's break down the cost of the meal:

Appetizer: $8
Entr√©e: $20, but with 50% off, the cost becomes $10
Wine: 2 x $3 = $6
Dessert: $6

The total cost of the meal without the tip would be $8 + $10 + $6 + $6 = $20 + $6 = $32.

The tip is 20% of the full cost, which is $32. 20% of $32 is $6.4. So, the total cost including the tip is $32 + $6.4 = $38.4.
