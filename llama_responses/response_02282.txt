Let's break down the problem step by step.

Marcus wants to buy a pair of shoes and is willing to pay no more than $130. He found a pair for $120, but he got a discount of 30% on it.

To find the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price. To do this, we multiply the original price by 0.3.

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, the discount is $36. To find the price after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price.

120 - 36 = 84

Marcus will pay $84 for the shoes, which is $46 less than his initial budget of $130. So, he will save $46.

Answer: 46
