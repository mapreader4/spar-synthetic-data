Let's break it down step by step.

1. The company has 500 employees, each paid $12 per hour, working 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. So, the total hours worked per month is:

500 employees * 10 hours * 5 days * 4 weeks = 500 * 10 * 5 * 4 = 10000 hours per month.

2. The total amount paid to each employee per month is:

10000 hours * $12 per hour = $12000 per month.

3. The company hired 200 more people. So, the new total number of employees is:

500 + 200 = 700 employees.

4. The total amount paid to all employees per month is:

700 employees * $12 per hour = 700 * $12 = $8400 per month.

So, the company pays in total per month is $8400.
