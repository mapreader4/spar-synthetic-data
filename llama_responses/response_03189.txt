Let's break this down step by step:

1. Gary starts with 4 chickens.
2. After 2 years, he has 8 times as many chickens as he started with. This means he now has 4 * 8 = 32 chickens.
3. Each chicken lays 6 eggs a day. So, in a week, each chicken lays 6 * 7 = 42 eggs.
4. Since Gary has 32 chickens, he collects 32 * 42 = 1344 eggs every week.

Answer: 1344
