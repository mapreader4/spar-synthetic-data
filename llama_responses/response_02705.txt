Let's break it down step by step.

1. Max's original bill is $60 per month.
2. It increased by 30% when he started working from home.
3. To find the increase, multiply 30% of the original bill by the original bill: 30% * $60 = 0.3 * 60 = $18.
4. Add the increase to the original bill: $60 + $18 = $78.

Answer: 78
