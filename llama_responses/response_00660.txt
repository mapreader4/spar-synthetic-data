Let's start by identifying the number of ants Abe finds.

Abe finds 4 ants.

Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe, so Beth sees 4 + 50% = 6 ants.

CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe, so CeCe watches 4 * 2 = 8 ants.

Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe, so Duke discovers 4 / 2 = 2 ants.

The total number of ants the four children find is the sum of the number of ants each child finds: 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20.

Answer: 20
