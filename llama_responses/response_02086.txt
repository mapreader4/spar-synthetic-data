Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many of each item the store needs to purchase to fill the displays.

The necklace stand needs to hold 12 necklaces, but it currently holds 5 necklaces, so it needs 12 - 5 = 7 more necklaces. The ring display needs to hold 30 rings, but it currently holds 18 rings, so it needs 30 - 18 = 12 more rings. The bracelet display needs to hold 15 bracelets, but it currently holds 8 bracelets, so it needs 15 - 8 = 7 more bracelets.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each item:

* Necklaces: 7 necklaces * $4 per necklace = 7 * 4 = $28
* Rings: 12 rings * $10 per ring = 12 * 10 = $120
* Bracelets: 7 bracelets * $5 per bracelet = 7 * 5 = $35

To find the total cost, we add the costs of each item together: $28 + $120 + $35 = $183.

Answer: 183
