Let's break this down step by step.

Quinton started with 40 cupcakes.

He gave 18 cupcakes to Ms. Delmont's class, which means he gave away 18 cupcakes.

Then, he gave 16 cupcakes to Mrs. Donnelly's class, which means he gave away another 16 cupcakes.

He also gave cupcakes to 3 additional people: Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, and the school principal. So, that's 3 more cupcakes given away.

In total, he gave away 18 + 16 + 3 = 37 cupcakes.

To find out how many cupcakes Quinton has left over, we subtract the number of cupcakes he gave away from the total number of cupcakes he started with:

40 - 37 = 3

Answer: 3
