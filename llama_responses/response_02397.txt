Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find out how many hours Nathan played. He played for 3 hours every day for 2 weeks. So, we can multiply the number of hours he played per day by the number of days he played:

3 hours/day * 2 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 hours

Now, let's find out how many hours Tobias played. He played for 5 hours every day, but only for 1 week. So, we can multiply the number of hours he played per day by the number of days he played:

5 hours/day * 1 week = 5 * 7 = 35 hours

Now, let's add the number of hours Nathan played by the number of hours Tobias played:

21 hours + 35 hours = 56 hours

Answer: 56
