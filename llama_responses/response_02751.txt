Let's think step by step.

Let's say Jorge has an equal number of baseball cards as Matias. This means that the number of baseball cards Jorge has is equal to the number of baseball cards Matias has minus 6.

We know that Matias has 6 fewer baseball cards than Carlos. We can let's say Matias has x baseball cards. Then, Jorge has x baseball cards, because they have the same number of baseball cards.

So, we have the equation: x - 6 = Carlos's number of baseball cards. We know Carlos has 20 baseball cards, so we can write the equation as: x - 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we add 6 to both sides of the equation. So, we get: x = 20 + 6 = 26.

Answer: 26
