Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first identify the number of theme parks in each town:

1. Jamestown: We know that Jamestown has 20 theme parks.
2. Venice: We know that Venice has 20 + 25 = 45 theme parks more than Jamestown.
3. Marina Del Ray: We know that Marina Del Ray has 50 more theme parks than Jamestown, so it has 20 + 50 = 70 theme parks.

Now, let's add up the number of theme parks in each town:

20 (Jamestown) + 45 (Venice) + 70 (Marina Del Ray) = 135

Answer: 135
