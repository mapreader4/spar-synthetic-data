To find the total number of students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class. There are 3 classes, and each class has 30 students, so we multiply 3 x 30 = 90 students. Then we add the P.E. class with 50 students, so we add 50 to 90, giving us a total of 140 students. So, Jessa needs to make 140 cupcakes.
