Let's break this problem down step by step.

There were 12000 dolls made, and each doll requires 45 seconds to make. So the total time required to make the dolls is:

12000 dolls * 45 seconds/doll = 540000 seconds

The accessories for each doll include 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats. So, for each doll, there are 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11 accessories. Since there are 12000 dolls, the total number of accessories is:

12000 dolls * 11 accessories/doll = 132000 accessories

Each accessory takes 10 seconds to make, so the total time required to make the accessories is:

132000 accessories * 10 seconds/accessory = 1320000 seconds

To find the total combined machine operation time, we add the time required to make the dolls and the accessories:

540000 seconds (dolls) + 1320000 seconds (accessories) = 1860000 seconds

Answer: 1860000
