Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of blue marbles is x.

We know that the number of blue marbles is 3 times the number of red marbles. So, we can write the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3

x = 4.67

But we know that x must be an integer, so we round up to the nearest whole number.

x = 5

So, there are 5 yellow marbles.
