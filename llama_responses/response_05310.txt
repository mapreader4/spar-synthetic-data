Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of words Sarah can read in 20 hours.

Since Sarah can read 40 words per minute, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Sarah can read 40 * 60 = 2400 words in 1 hour. In 20 hours, Sarah can read 2400 * 20 = 48000 words.

Step 2: Determine the number of pages Sarah can read in 48000 words.

Since each book has 100 words per page, Sarah can read 48000 / 100 = 480 pages.

Step 3: Determine the number of books Sarah should check out.

Since each book is 80 pages long, Sarah can read 480 / 80 = 6 books.
