Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find the cost of electricity in a day. The cost of the old refrigerator is 0.85 dollars. The cost of the new refrigerator is 0.45 dollars. The difference is 0.40 dollars.

Now, let's find the cost of electricity in a month. In 30 days, the cost will be 0.40 * 30 = 12.00 dollars.

The new refrigerator will save Kurt 12.00 - 0.85 = 11.15 dollars.

Answer: 11.15
