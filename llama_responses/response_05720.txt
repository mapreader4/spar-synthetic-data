Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of ladies on the first floor. We know there are a hundred ladies on the first floor.

Next, let's consider the number of ladies at the party on the second floor. We know there are three times that many girls at the party.

To find the total number of ladies on the two floors, we need to multiply the number of ladies on the first floor by 3. So, we have:

100 x 3 = 300

Answer: 300
