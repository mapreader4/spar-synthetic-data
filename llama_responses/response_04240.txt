Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

1. Diane turns 30, so we know that 2 * Diane's current age is 30.
2. Since Diane is 16 years old now, we know that 2 * Diane's current age is 2 * 16 = 32.
3. Since Diane is half the age of Alex, we know that Alex's current age is 2 * Diane's current age = 2 * 16 = 32.
4. Since Diane is twice as old as Allison, we know that Allison's current age is 2 * Diane's current age = 2 * 16 = 32.

Now, let's add the ages of Alex and Allison together.

Alex's age is 32 and Allison's age is also 32. The sum of their ages is:

32 + 32 = 64.

Answer: 64
