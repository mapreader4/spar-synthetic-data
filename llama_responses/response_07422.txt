Let's break this down step by step.

Mark fills the punch bowl part way, but we don't know how much he fills it. Let's call this amount x.

Then, his cousin drinks half of the punch in the bowl, so the amount of punch left is x - (x/2).

Mark refills the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, so now the amount of punch is (x - (x/2)) + 4.

Then, Sally drinks 2 more gallons of punch, so the amount of punch left is ((x - (x/2)) + 4) - 2.

Finally, Mark has to add 12 gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl, so we can set up the equation:

x - (x/2) + 4 - 2 + 12 = 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - (x/2) + 14 = 16

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get:

x - (x/2) = 2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2x - x = 4

Adding x to both sides, we get:

3x = 4

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 4/3

x = 1.33 (approximately)

So Mark initially added 1.33 gallons of punch to the bowl.
