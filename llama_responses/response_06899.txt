Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Elvie's age is x.

The total for the sum and product of Elvie's age and Arielle's age are 131. The sum is the sum of the two ages, so we can set up an equation:

x + x = 131

We can subtract x from both sides of the equation to get:

x - x = 131 - x

This simplifies to:

0 = 131 - x

To solve for x, we can subtract 131 from both sides:

x = 0

Since x is Elvie's age, we know that x = 10. So, Arielle's age is 10 as well.

Answer: 10
