Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of lion cubs born in a year.

Number of lion cubs born in a year = Number of lion cubs born in a month * 12

Number of lion cubs born in a year = 5 * 12 = 60

Now, let's find the number of lions that die in a year.

Number of lions that die in a year = Number of lions that die in a month * 12

Number of lions that die in a year = 1 * 12 = 12

Now, let's find the total number of lions in Londolozi after 1 year.

Total number of lions = Total number of lion cubs born in a year - Total number of lions that die in a year

Total number of lions = 60 - 12
