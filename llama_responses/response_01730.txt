Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of 1 dozen, which is 12. If 1 dozen costs $8, then 2 dozen (which is 24) will cost 2 * 8 = $16. Now, let's find the cost of 6 sets of 1 dozen. 6 * 12 = 72. Now, let's compare the costs. The cost of 6 sets of 2 dozen is $14, and the cost of 3 sets of 2 dozen is $18. So, the difference is 18 - 14 = $4. Therefore, you will save $4 by buying 3 sets of 2 dozens than buying 6 sets of 1 dozen.
