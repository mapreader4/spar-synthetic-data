Let's start by finding the number of letters Greta received. Since Greta received 10 more letters than her brother, and Greta's brother received 40 letters, then Greta received 40 + 10 = 50 letters.

Greta's mother received the total number of letters Greta and her brother received. This is 50 + 40 = 90 letters.

So, the answer is: Answer: 90
