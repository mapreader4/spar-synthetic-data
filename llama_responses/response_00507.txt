Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: The price per pound is $15.  He buys 20 pounds, so the total cost of the steaks will be the price per pound multiplied by the number of pounds.

Cost per pound: $15
Number of pounds: 20

Total cost = Cost per pound x Number of pounds = 15 x 20 = 300

Answer: 300
