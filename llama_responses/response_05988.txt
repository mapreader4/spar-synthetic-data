Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Each tank has 4 pregnant fish. So, in total, there are 3 x 4 = 12 pregnant fish.

Step 2: Each fish gives birth to 20 young fish. So, each of the 12 pregnant fish gives birth to 20 young fish. We can multiply the number of pregnant fish by the number of young fish each fish gives birth to: 12 * 20 = 240 young fish.

Step 3: So, in total, Mark has 240 young fish.

Answer: 240
