Let's break this problem down step by step.

Kendy made 2 online bank transactions. The first transaction was transferring $60 to her mom. This means that the initial amount in Kendy's account decreased by $60.

The second transaction was transferring half of the initial amount, which is $60, to her sister. This means that the initial amount decreased by another $30.

So, the initial amount in Kendy's account was $60 + $30, which is equal to $90.

Answer: 90
