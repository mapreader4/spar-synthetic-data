Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of movies watched by each person:

* Dalton watched 7 movies.
* Hunter watched 12 movies.
* Alex watched 15 movies.

Next, we need to find the number of movies they watched together. They watched 2 movies together, but they are not all the same, so we need to subtract this from the total number of movies watched by each person.

Let's subtract 2 from each person's total:

* Dalton's total is 7, so subtract 2: 7 - 2 = 5
* Hunter's total is 12, so subtract 2: 12 - 2 = 10
* Alex's total is 15, so subtract 2: 15 - 2 = 13

Now, we need to find the total number of different movies they watched. We can add up the number of different movies each person watched:

5 + 10 + 13 = 28

Answer: 28
