To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratio and proportion. We know that the ratio of marbles that Mario and Manny have is 4:5. This means that for every 4 marbles that Mario has, Manny has 5 marbles. We know that the total number of marbles is 36, so Mario has 36 รท 4 = 9 marbles. Therefore, Manny has 36 - 9 = 27 marbles. Now, if Manny gives 2 marbles to his brother, he has 27 - 2 = 25 marbles left.
