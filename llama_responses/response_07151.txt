Let's break this problem down step by step.

In the first year, Kate visits the museum 12 times (since she visits once a month). The entrance fee is $5, so the total cost for the first year is:

12 x 5 = 60

In the second year, the entrance fee is $7, and Kate visits the museum 4 times. The total cost for the second year is:

4 x 7 = 28

In the third year, the entrance fee is still $7, and Kate visits the museum 4 times. The total cost for the third year is:

4 x 7 = 28

To find the total cost for all visits to the Art-museum after 3 years, we add the costs for each year:

60 + 28 + 28 = 116

So, Kate paid a total of 116 dollars for all visits to the Art-museum after 3 years.

Answer: 116
