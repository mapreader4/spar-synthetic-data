Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total amount of sales that Mr. Brandon made yesterday. This is given as $80.

Next, we are told that 2/5 of the total amount of sales were credit sales. This means that the remaining 3/5 of the total amount of sales were cash sales.

To find the amount of cash sales, we need to find 3/5 of the total amount of sales. To do this, we can multiply the total amount of sales by 3/5.

$80 * 3/5 = $48

So, Mr. Brandon got $48 from cash sales.

Answer: 48
