Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of kernels that popped in all three bags. We can do this by adding the number of kernels that popped in each bag:

60 (bag 1) + 42 (bag 2) + 82 (bag 3) = 184 kernels

Next, we need to find the total number of kernels in all three bags. We can do this by adding the number of kernels in each bag:

75 (bag 1) + 50 (bag 2) + 100 (bag 3) = 225 kernels

Now, we can find the average percentage of kernels that popped by dividing the total number of kernels that popped by the total number of kernels, and then multiplying by 100:

(184 kernels that popped) / (225 kernels total) = 0.82

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.82 x 100 = 82%

So, the average percentage of kernels that pop in a bag is 82%.

Answer: 82
