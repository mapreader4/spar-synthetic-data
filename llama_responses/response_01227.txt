Let's start by finding the total number of crayons Francine has. Francine has 5 full boxes of crayons, which means she has 5 x 10 = 50 crayons. She also has 5 loose crayons, so the total number of crayons she has is 50 + 5 = 55 crayons. Her friend has 27 loose crayons. So, together they have 55 + 27 = 82 crayons. They need to put all of their crayons in a box. Since they have 85 crayons, they need 85 - 82 = 3 boxes.
