Let's break down the problem step by step.

Gnuff charges a flat rate of $20 per tutoring session, so the rate per minute is $20 / 60 = $0.33 per minute.

The total amount paid for Gnuff for tutoring for one session is $146. We can set up an equation to represent this:

0.33x = 146

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.33:

x = 146 / 0.33

x = 440

So, Gnuff tutored for 440 minutes.
