Let's break it down step by step:

1. The crab dish requires 1.5 pounds of crab meat per day. Since Johnny makes the dish 40 times a day, the total amount of crab meat needed is:
1.5 * 40 = 60 pounds of crab meat per day
2. Since he is closed 3 days a week, the total amount of crab meat needed for the week is:
60 pounds of crab meat * 3 = 180 pounds of crab meat
3. The crab meat sells for $8 per pound, so the total cost of the crab meat is:
180 pounds of crab meat * $8 per pound = 1440 dollars

So, the answer is:

Answer: 1440
