Let's start by saying that Carla won x games.  Frankie won 30 - x games.  The total number of games played is 30 + x, which is 30 + x = 60.  Since Frankie won half as many games as did Carla, that means Frankie won 15 games.  Then, Frankie won 15 games and Carla won 30 - 15 = 15 games.  Carla won 15 games.
