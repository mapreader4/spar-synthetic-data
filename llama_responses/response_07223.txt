Let's break it down step by step.

Méliès has 180 dollars in his wallet.

The meat costs 82 dollars per kilogram, and he buys 2 kg of it. So, the cost of the meat is:

2 kg * 82 dollars per kg = 2 x 82 = 164 dollars

Méliès has 180 dollars in his wallet, and he spends 164 dollars on the meat. To find out how much money he has left, we need to subtract the cost of the meat from the money he has:

180 - 164 = 16

So, Méliès has 16 dollars left.
