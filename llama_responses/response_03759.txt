Let's start by identifying the number of bottles that the first house receives.

We know that the first house receives half the number of each type of drink. Since there are 40 bottles of cider, the first house receives 40/2 = 20 bottles of cider.

Similarly, there are 80 bottles of beer, and the first house receives half of that, which is 80/2 = 40 bottles of beer.

The remaining bottles are the mixture of cider and beer. There are 180 - 40 - 80 = 40 bottles left, and the first house receives half of those, which is 40/2 = 20 bottles of the mixture.

In total, the first house receives 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 bottles of drinks.
