Let's think step by step.

Let's say the number of days it takes Bert to have the same number of kangaroos as Kameron does now is x.

In that case, Bert will buy 2 kangaroos per day for x days. So, he will buy a total of 2x kangaroos.

Since Bert starts with 20 kangaroos, he will have 20 + 2x kangaroos after x days. But he needs to have 100 kangaroos, which is the same as Kameron, so we can set up the equation:

20 + 2x = 100

To solve for x, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 80

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2

x = 40

So, Bert will need 40 days to have the same number of kangaroos as Kameron does now.
