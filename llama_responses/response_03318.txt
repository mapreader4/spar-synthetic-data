Let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Kannon had 3 apples and 1 banana and 4 oranges.

Today, she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, so that would be 7 apples. She ate 1 banana last night, so today she will eat 1 banana. She will have twice as many oranges as apples as she'll have today, so that would be 14 oranges. So, the total number of fruits she will have today would be 7 apples, 1 banana, and 14 oranges.

So, in total, she would have eaten 7 + 1 + 14 = 22 fruits in the two meals.
