Let's start by finding out how much money Tobias has saved up. He gets a $5 allowance a month for 3 months, so he has saved $5 x 3 = $15. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He mows 4 lawns for $15 each, so he makes $15 x 4 = $60. Let's call the number of driveways he shovels x. He charges $7 for each driveway, so he makes $7x. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. He spent $95 on the shoes, so he must have $15 + $95 = $110 before buying the shoes. He has $60 from mowing lawns, so he must have $110 - $60 = $50 left from his allowance. He spent $50 on the shoes, so he must have earned $50 from shoveling driveways. $50 = $7x, so x = $50 / $7 = 7. He shoveled 7 driveways.
