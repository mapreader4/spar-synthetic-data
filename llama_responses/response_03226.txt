Let's break this down step by step.

Wade makes $2.00 in tips per customer, and he served:

* 28 customers on Friday
* 3 x 28 = 84 customers on Saturday
* 36 customers on Sunday

So, the total number of customers he served is 28 + 84 + 36 = 148 customers.

Since he makes $2.00 in tips per customer, the total tips he made is:

148 customers * $2.00 per customer = $296.00

Answer: 296
