Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The company increased its toilet paper production by three times. So, the new production rate is 3 x 7000 = 21000 toilet paper per day.

2. Since March has 31 days, the total number of days in March is 31.

3. To find the total toilet paper production during March, we multiply the daily production rate by the number of days: 21000 * 31 = 651000.

Answer: 651000
