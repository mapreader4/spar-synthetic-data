Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's add up the cost of all the items Josie bought:

* Carton of milk: $4.00
* Loaf of bread: $3.50
* Box of laundry detergent: $10.25 - $1.25 (after applying the coupon) = $9.00
* 2 pounds of bananas: 2 x $0.75 = $1.50

The total cost of the items is $4.00 + $3.50 + $9.00 + $1.50 = $17.50.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the initial $20 bill:

$20.00 - $17.50 = $2.50

Josie has $2.50 left over.
