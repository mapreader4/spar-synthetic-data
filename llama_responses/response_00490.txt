Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's call the length of the third side of the triangle x.

We know that the perimeter of the triangle is 160 cm, so we can set up the equation:

40 + 50 + x = 160

Subtract 40 and 50 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 70

So, the length of the third side is 70 cm.

Answer: 70
