Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us.

* Michelle had some leftover cans of silly string.
* She split them among Roger and 3 of his friends.
* Roger decided to give 2 of his cans to his brothers so that he now has 4 for himself.

Let's find the total number of cans Roger has. We know that Roger gave 2 cans to his brothers, so he now has 4 cans. So, the total number of cans Roger has is 4.

Now, let's find the number of cans Michelle had. We know that Roger had 4 cans, and he got 2 from Michelle. So, Michelle must have had 4 + 2 cans to give to Roger. So, Michelle had 6 cans to start with.

Answer: 6
