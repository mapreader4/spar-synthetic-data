Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. There are 15 people in the house.
2. 3/5 of the people eat pizza. So, 3/5 * 15 = 9 people eat pizza.
3. Each person eating pizza takes 4 pieces. So, 9 people eat 9 * 4 = 36 pieces.
4. Aviana brought pizza with 50 pieces.
5. 50 - 36 = 14 pieces remain.
