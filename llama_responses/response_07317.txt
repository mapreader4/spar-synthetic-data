Let's break it down step by step.

Mark has to wait 4 days for his first vaccine appointment.
Then he has to wait 20 days for his second vaccine appointment.
Then he has to wait 14 days for the vaccine to be fully effective, since 2 weeks is 14 days.

So, Mark has to wait 4 + 20 + 14 days in total. This is 38 days.
