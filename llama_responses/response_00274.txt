Let's start by identifying the number of marbles that Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, so if Mabel has 85 marbles, then Katrina has 85 รท 5 = 17 marbles.

Now, we know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So, Amanda needs 2 x 17 = 34 marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina.

To find out how many marbles Mabel has more than Amanda, we need to subtract the number of marbles Amanda needs from the number of marbles Mabel has. So, Mabel has 85 - 34 = 51 more marbles than Amanda.

Answer: 51
