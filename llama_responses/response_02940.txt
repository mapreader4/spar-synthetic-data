Let's break this problem down step by step.

Chrystal's speed is 30 miles per hour. When ascending the mountain, her speed decreases by 50%, which means it becomes 30 - (30 x 0.5) = 15 miles per hour.

When descending the mountain, her speed increases by 20%, which means it becomes 30 + (30 x 0.2) = 36 miles per hour.

The distance going to the top of the mountain is 60 miles, and her speed is 15 miles per hour, so the time it takes to go up is 60 / 15 = 4 hours.

The distance going down is 72 miles, and her speed is 36 miles per hour, so the time it takes to go down is 72 / 36 = 2 hours.

The total time it takes to go up and down the mountain is 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.
