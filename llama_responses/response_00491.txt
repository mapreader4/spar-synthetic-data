Let's break it down step by step.

Jess has to walk 11 blocks to the store. Then, she has to walk 6 blocks to the gallery. Then, she has to walk 8 blocks to arrive at work. So, the total number of blocks she has to walk is 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 blocks. 

If Jess has already walked 5 blocks, then she has walked 25 - 5 = 20 more blocks left to walk before arriving at work. 

Answer: 20
