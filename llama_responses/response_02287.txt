Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of green cars Jason counted is x.

We know that the number of green cars is the same as the number of red cars. So, we can write the equation x = x.

We also know that the number of red cars is 6 more than the number of purple cars. So, we can write the equation x + 6 = x - y, where y is the number of purple cars.

We are given that Jason counted 312 cars total. So, we can set up the equation x + x - y = 312.

We can add x + x to both sides of the equation to get 2x - y = 312. Then, we can add 1 to both sides to get 2x = 313 - y + 1.

We are trying to find the number of purple cars, so we want to get y by itself. To do this, we can subtract 313 - 1 from both sides of the equation to get y = 312 - 1.

So, the number of purple cars is 312 - 311 = 1.
