Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the skirts and blouses.

The cost of the skirts is 2 x 13 = 26.

The cost of the blouses is 3 x 6 = 18.

The total cost of the skirts and blouses is 26 + 18 = 44.

Jane paid $100. So, the change is:

100 - 44 = 56.

Answer: 56
