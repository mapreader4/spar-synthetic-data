Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the cost of each meal.

Curtis ordered the Salisbury Steak that costs $16.00. Since they ate between 2-4 pm, the Early Bird discount applies. The discount is 50% off the menu price, so the discounted price is:

$16.00 - (50% of $16.00) = $16.00 - $8.00 = $8.00

Rob ordered the Chicken Fried Steak at $18.00. Since they ate between 2-4 pm, the Early Bird discount applies. The discount is 50% off the menu price, so the discounted price is:

$18.00 - (50% of $18.00) = $18.00 - $9.00 = $9.00

Now, let's add the cost of both meals together:

$8.00 + $9.00 = $17.00
