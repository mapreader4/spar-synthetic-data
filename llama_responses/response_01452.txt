To find the time it takes for Abel to reach the destination, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Abel, Time = 1000 / 50 = 20 hours

For Alice, Time = 1000 / 40 = 25 hours

To find the difference in time, we can subtract the times:

Time (Abel) - Time (Alice) = 20 - 25 = -5 hours

Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert the time to minutes by multiplying by 60:

-5 hours * 60 = -300 minutes

So, Abel reaches the destination 300 minutes earlier than Alice.
