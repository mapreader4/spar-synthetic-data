Let's start by identifying the number of legs Borgnine has already seen. He has seen 12 chimps, 8 lions, and 5 lizards. To find the total number of legs, we can add these numbers together:

12 chimps = 4 legs each, so 12 x 4 = 48 legs
8 lions = 4 legs each, so 8 x 4 = 32 legs
5 lizards = 4 legs each, so 5 x 4 = 20 legs

Adding these numbers together, we get 48 + 32 + 20 = 100 legs. Borgnine has seen 100 legs so far. He needs to see 1100 - 100 = 1000 more legs to meet his goal.

Answer: 1000
