Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of guests: 120.

Ashley wants to serve 2 glasses of champagne to each guest, so the total number of glasses needed is 2 * 120 = 240 glasses.

Now, 1 bottle of champagne has 6 servings. To find out how many bottles she'll need, we'll divide the total number of glasses needed by the number of servings per bottle. 240 glasses / 6 servings per bottle = 40 bottles.

So, Ashley will need 40 bottles of champagne.
