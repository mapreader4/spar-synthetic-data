Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Ishmael was 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, and Ponce was 10 pounds lighter than Jalen.

We know that Jalen weighed 160 pounds. So, Ponce must be 160 - 10 = 150 pounds.

We also know that Ishmael was 20 pounds heavier than Ponce. So, Ishmael must be 150 + 20 = 170 pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three, we add up their weights and divide by 3.

Ishmael = 170, Ponce = 150, Jalen = 160. The sum is 170 + 150 + 160 = 480. To find the average, we divide 480 by 3.

480 / 3 = 160.

Answer: 160
