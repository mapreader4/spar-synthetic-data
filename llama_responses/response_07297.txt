Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of money Aurelia made from selling her used electronics. Since Aurelia made 70% of what Lauryn made, and Lauryn made $2000, we can set up an equation to solve for Aurelia's amount:

Let x be the amount Aurelia made.
Lauryn made $2000 and Aurelia made 70% of that, so we can write the equation:

x = 0.7 * 2000

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 100 to get:

x = 1400

So Aurelia made $1400 from selling her used electronics.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the two friends made. To do this, we add the amounts together:

Lauryn made $2000 and Aurelia made $1400, so the total amount is:

2000 + 1400 = 3400

Answer: 3400
