Let's break this down step by step.

Jeff has 16 GB of storage on his phone, which is equal to 16 * 1000 MB. He is already using 4 GB, which is equal to 4 * 1000 MB. So, he has 16 * 1000 - 4 * 1000 MB left. This is equal to 12 * 1000 MB.

Each song takes up about 30 MB of storage. So, to find the number of songs he can store, we can divide 12 * 1000 MB by 30 MB. This is equal to 12 * 1000 / 30. This is equal to 40.

Answer: 40
