Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of cans of soda needed. Since each person can consume 2 cans and there are 5 dozens of people, the total number of cans needed is:

5 dozens * 2 = 10

Since each box contains 10 cans, we need:

10 cans / 10 cans per box = 1 box

So, we need 1 box of soda.

The cost of the soda is $2 per box. Since we need 1 box, the total cost is:

$2

Now, we need to divide the cost equally among the 6 family members. To do this, we can divide the cost by the number of family members:

$2 / 6 = $0.33

So, each family member will pay $0.33.
