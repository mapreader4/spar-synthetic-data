Let's think step by step.

Let's say the side of the square paper is 20 cm. Then, the perimeter of the square is 4 x 20 = 80 cm.

Since the perimeter of the square paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen, we can set up an equation to represent this.

Let's say the height of the screen is x cm. Then, we know that the perimeter of the square paper is 80 cm, so we can set up the equation 4x = 80 - 20.

Now, we can solve for the height of the screen. To do this, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to get x = 60.

So, the height of the screen is 60 cm.
