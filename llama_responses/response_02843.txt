Let's think step by step!

Let's break this down. 

Greg has rode for 600 times, and each block he rides, his wheels rotate 200 times. So, he has rode 600 / 200 = 3 blocks. This means he has rode 3 blocks already.

Greg wants to ride at least 8 blocks. He has already ridden 3 blocks, so he needs to ride 8 - 3 = 5 more blocks to reach his goal.

So, the wheels need to rotate 5 more times to reach his goal.

Answer: 5
