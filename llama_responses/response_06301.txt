Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know:
- Randolph is 5 years older than Sydney.
- Sydney is twice as old as Sherry.
- Sherry is 25 years old.

From the first statement, we know that Randolph is 5 years older than Sydney, so Randolph is Sydney's age + 5. We know that Sydney is 25 years old, so Randolph is 25 + 5 = 30 years old.

Answer: 30
