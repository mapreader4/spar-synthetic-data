Let's break this down step by step.

The hobby store sells 21,122 trading cards per month normally. In June, it sold 3,922 more trading cards than normal. This means that in June, it sold 21,122 + 3,922 trading cards.

To find the total number of trading cards sold in June and July, we need to add the number of cards sold in June to the regular number of cards sold per month.

Regular number of cards sold per month: 21,122
Number of cards sold in June: 3,922

Add the two numbers together: 21,122 + 3,922 = 25,044

Answer: 25,044
