Let's start by identifying how many pages Liza reads in one hour. Since Liza reads 20 pages in one hour, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Liza's reading rate = 20 pages per hour.

Now, we can set up an equation to find how many pages Liza reads in 3 hours. We can multiply the rate of pages read per hour by the number of hours:

Liza's reading rate * 3 hours = Liza's total pages read in 3 hours

We can solve for Liza's total pages read in 3 hours by multiplying the rate of pages read per hour by the number of hours:

Liza's reading rate * 3 = 20 * 3 = 60

So, Liza reads 60 pages in 3 hours. To find out how many more pages Liza reads than Suzie, we can subtract Suzie's rate by Liza's rate:

Liza's pages read - Suzie's pages read = 60 - 45 = 15

So, Liza reads 15 more pages than Suzie.
