Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of people: the couple and their 6 children. That is a total of 8 people.

Next, we need to find the number of slices each person wants. The couple wants 3 slices each, and the children want 1 slice each. That is a total of 8 slices.

Now, we need to find the total number of slices needed. The total number of slices needed is the total number of people multiplied by the number of slices each person wants. In this case, that is 8 * 3 + 6 * 1. 8 * 3 = 24 + 6 = 30.

So, the couple and their children should order 30 slices of pizza.
