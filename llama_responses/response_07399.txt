Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 6 oranges in the fruit basket.
2. There are 2 fewer oranges than apples. So, let's say the number of apples is x. Then, we can write the equation: 6 - x = 2. This means that x = 4.
3. There are 3 times as many bananas as apples. So, the number of bananas is 4 * 3 = 12.
4. There are half as many peaches as bananas. So, the number of peaches is 12 / 2 = 6.

To find the total number of fruit pieces, we add the numbers: 6 (oranges) + 4 (apples) + 12 (bananas) + 6 (peaches) = 28.

Answer: 28
