Let's break this down step by step.

Era had 5 burgers, and she sliced each burger into halves. So, she had 5 x 2 = 10 burger halves.

The first and second friends got 1 and 2 slices, respectively, which is a total of 3 slices. The third and fourth friends got 3 slices each, which is a total of 6 slices. So, the total number of slices given away is 3 + 6 = 9 slices.

Since Era had 10 burger halves, and 9 slices were given away, the number of slices left for Era is:

Answer: 10 - 9 = 1
