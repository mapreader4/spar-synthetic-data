Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Foster Farms donated 45 dressed chickens.

2. American Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chickens donated by Foster Farms. So, American Summits donated 2 x 45 = 90 bottled water.

3. Hormel donated three times the number of dressed chickens that Foster Farms donated. So, Hormel donated 3 x 45 = 135 dressed chickens.

4. Boudin Butchers donated one-third of the number of dressed chickens that Hormel donated. So, Boudin Butchers donated 1/3 x 135 = 45 dressed chickens.

5. Del Monte Foods donated 30 fewer bottles of water than American Summits. So, Del Monte Foods donated 90 - 30 = 60 bottled water.

Now, let's add up the total number of food items donated:

* Foster Farms: 45 dressed chickens
* American Summits: 90 bottled water
* Hormel: 135 dressed chickens
* Boudin Butchers: 45 dressed chickens
* Del Monte Foods: 60 bottled water

Total: 45 + 90 + 135 + 45 + 60 = 375

Answer: 375
