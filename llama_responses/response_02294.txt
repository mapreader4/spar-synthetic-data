Let's start by using the information that there are 17 more oranges in the second bucket than in the third. So, the number of oranges in the third bucket is 6 (17 - 11 = 6).

The number of oranges in the first bucket is 22. The number of oranges in the second bucket is 17. The number of oranges in the third bucket is 6.

To find the total number of oranges, we add these numbers together: 22 + 17 + 6 = 45.

Answer: 45
