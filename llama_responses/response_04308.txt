Let's think step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: 
- John goes to the bakery to buy rolls.
- They sell them for 5 dollars for a dozen.
- He spent 15 dollars.

From the information, we can infer that John bought more than one dozen rolls. If he bought a dozen (12) rolls for 5 dollars, it would cost 5 * 12 = 60 dollars. Since he spent 15 dollars, he must have bought less than a dozen. 

Let's think about this logically. If he spent 15 dollars, but a dozen would cost 60 dollars, he must have bought less than 2 dozen (24) rolls. 

The answer to this is 23.
