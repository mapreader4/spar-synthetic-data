Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

* Maddy's 4th grade class needs to make Valentine's Day cards.
* There are 30 kids in the class.
* Each kid will make 8 cards.

We can find the total number of cards that will be made by multiplying the number of kids by the number of cards each kid will make. 30 * 8 = 240.

To get a pizza party, they will need more than 240 cards. So, the number of cards they need to make more is 1000 - 240 = 760.

Answer: 760
