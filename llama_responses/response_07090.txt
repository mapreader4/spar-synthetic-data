Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

* Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve.
* Steve has double the number of berries that Skylar has.

Let's represent the number of berries Steve has as x.
Then, we know that Steve has double the number of berries that Skylar has, so we can write the equation x = 2y, where y is the number of berries Skylar has.

We are also given that Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve, so we can write the equation Stacy = 4x.

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that the total number of berries is 1100, and we can write the equation 4x + x = 1100.

To solve for x, we can subtract 4x from both sides of the equation to get x = 1100/5 = 220.

Answer: 220
