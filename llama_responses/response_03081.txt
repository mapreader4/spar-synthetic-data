Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. The pea patch is twice as big as the radish patch, so we know that the area of the pea patch is 2x the area of the radish patch.
2. We are given that one-sixth of the pea patch is 5 square feet. So, we can set up an equation to solve for the area of the pea patch:

2x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 5 / 2
x = 2.5

So, the area of the pea patch is 2.5 square feet. Since the pea patch is twice as big as the radish patch, we can multiply the area of the pea patch by 2 to find the area of the radish patch:

2.5 x 2 = 5 x 2
= 5 x 2
= 10

So, the area of the radish patch is 10 square feet.
