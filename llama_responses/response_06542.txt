Let's break down the problem step by step.

The house has three bedrooms, and the client wants each bedroom painted a different color. This means Bill will need three cans of color paint, one for each bedroom.

The house also has twice as many other rooms as bedrooms, which means it has 3 x 2 = 6 other rooms. These rooms will be painted white, so Bill will need 6 cans of white paint.

Each room takes 2 gallons of paint, so Bill will need 3 (bedrooms) x 2 (gallons per room) + 6 (other rooms) x 2 (gallons per room) = 18 gallons of paint.

Color paint comes in 1-gallon cans, so Bill will need 18 (gallons) / 1 (gallon per can) = 18 cans of color paint.

White paint comes in 3-gallon cans, so Bill will need 6 (cans of white paint) x 3 (gallons per can) = 18 gallons of white paint. Since white paint comes in 3-gallon cans, Bill will need 18 (gallons) / 3 (gallons per can) = 6 cans of white paint.

In total, Bill will need 18 (cans of color paint) + 6 (cans of white paint) = 24 cans of paint.
