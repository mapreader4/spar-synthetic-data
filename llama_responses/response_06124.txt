Let's break it down step by step:

1. Amare needs to make 4 dresses and each dress requires 5.5 yards of fabric. So, Amare needs a total of 4 x 5.5 = 22 yards of fabric.
2. Amare has 7 feet of fabric, which is equal to 7 x 3 = 21 yards of fabric.
3. So, Amare has 21 yards of fabric and needs 22 yards of fabric. Therefore, Amare still needs 22 - 21 = 1 yard of fabric.
