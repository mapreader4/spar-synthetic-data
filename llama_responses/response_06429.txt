Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total grams of protein from the collagen powder. Since the collagen powder has 18 grams of protein for every 2 scoops, and he has 1 scoop, we can find the total grams of protein from the collagen powder by multiplying 18 by 0.5 (since he has half a scoop). So, the total grams of protein from collagen powder is 18 * 0.5 = 9.

Next, let's find the total grams of protein from the protein powder. The protein powder has 21 grams of protein per scoop, and he has 1 scoop, so the total grams of protein from protein powder is 21.

Finally, let's find the total grams of protein from the steak. The steak has 56 grams of protein.

Now, let's add up the grams of protein from all the sources. We have 9 grams from collagen powder, 21 grams from protein powder, and 56 grams from the steak. To find the total, we add these numbers together: 9 + 21 + 56 = 86.

Answer: 86
