Let's start by identifying the information given in the question. We know that the basket can hold 40 fruit altogether, and there are 3 times as many apples as oranges. We can let's represent the number of oranges as "x". So, the total number of fruit is 40, and the number of apples is 3x. We can write this as an equation: 40 = x + 3x. Since the question asks for the number of oranges, we can solve for x. We can subtract the number of apples from both sides of the equation to get: 40 - 3x = x. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3: 40 รท 3 = 13.33. So, there are 13 oranges.
