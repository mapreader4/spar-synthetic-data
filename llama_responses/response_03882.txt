Let's break this down step by step.

The problem states that Roland has a 12cm long thread, and he needs an additional three-quarters of what he has.

To find the total length needed, we need to multiply the amount of thread he has by 3/4.

12 cm * 3/4 = 9 cm

The total length required is 12 cm (the length he already has) + 9 cm (the additional length he needs) = 21 cm.
