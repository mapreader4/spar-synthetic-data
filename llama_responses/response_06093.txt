Let's break this problem down step by step.

Day 1: 30 squats
Day 2: 35 squats (30 + 5)
Day 3: 40 squats (35 + 5)
Day 4: 45 squats (40 + 5)
Day 5:? squats (45 + 5)

The pattern is adding 5 to the previous day's squats. So, the day after tomorrow, the number of squats would be 45 + 5 = 50.

Answer: 50
