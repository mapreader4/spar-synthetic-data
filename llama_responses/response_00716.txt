Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to convert the given amounts to cents.

Lance has 70 cents, which is the same as 0.7 dollars.
Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar, which is the same as 0.75 dollars. 0.75 dollars is equal to 75 cents.
Guy has two quarters and a dime, which is the same as 2 quarters and 1 dime. 2 quarters is 50 cents and 1 dime is 10 cents, so Guy has a total of 60 cents.
Bill has six dimes, which is 60 cents.

Now, let's add the amounts together.

0.7 + 0.75 + 0.6 + 0.6 = 1.95

Answer: 195
