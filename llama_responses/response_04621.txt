Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of strings for each type of guitar:

* Basses: 3 * 4 = 12 strings
* Guitars: 2 * 6 = 12 strings
* 3 fewer 8-string guitars: 8 - 3 = 5 strings

Now, we need to add up the total number of strings needed:

12 + 12 + 5 = 29

Answer: 29
