Let's break down the problem step by step.

Hunter saw 5 frogs sitting on top lily pads in the pond. This is the initial number of frogs he saw.

Then, three more frogs climbed out of the water onto logs floating in the pond. This means 3 frogs left the water, so the number of frogs in the pond is now 5 + 3 = 8.

Then, two dozen baby frogs hopped onto a big rock jutting out from the pond. Two dozen is equal to 24. So, 24 frogs joined the 8 frogs already in the pond, making the total number of frogs Hunter saw in the pond 8 + 24 = 32.

So, the answer is: Answer: 32.
