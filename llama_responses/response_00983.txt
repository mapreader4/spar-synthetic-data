Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

1. Carter is twice as tall as his 24” tall dog.
2. Betty is 12” shorter than Carter.

We can start by using the information in point 1 to find Carter's height. Since Carter is twice as tall as his 24” tall dog, Carter's height is 2 x 24 = 48”.

Now, we know Carter's height is 48”. We can use this information to find Betty's height.

Betty is 12” shorter than Carter, so we can subtract 12” from Carter's height to find Betty's height:

48” (Carter's height) - 12” = 36”

So, Betty's height is 36”.
