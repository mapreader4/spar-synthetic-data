Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of students who ate their animal crackers. Since 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, that means that 20 - 2 = 18 students ate their animal crackers.

Each pack of animal crackers contained 10 animal crackers. Since there were 18 students who ate their animal crackers, the total number of animal crackers eaten is 18 x 10 = 180.

Answer: 180
