Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the speed at which Karen is moving relative to the river. She is paddling 10 miles per hour, but the river is moving in the opposite direction at 4 miles per hour. So, her effective speed is:

10 miles per hour - 4 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour

Karen's effective speed is 6 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time it will take her to paddle up the 12-mile river. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 12 miles / 6 miles per hour

Time = 12 / 6

Time = 2 hours

So, it will take Karen 2 hours to paddle up the 12-mile river.
