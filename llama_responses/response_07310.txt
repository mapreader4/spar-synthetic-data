Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of chairs. We know there are 7 rows and each row has 12 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 7 * 12 = 84.

However, some people arrived late and grabbed 11 extra chairs. So, we need to subtract 11 from 84 to find the final number of chairs.

84 - 11 = 73

Answer: 73
