To solve this problem, I will start by identifying the information given. We know that Emma's sister is 9 years older than Emma, so Emma's sister's age is 7 + 9 = 16. 

Next, we know that Emma's sister will be 56 years old when she is 16 years older than Emma. Since Emma will be 56 - 16 = 40 years old. So, the answer is:

Answer: 40
