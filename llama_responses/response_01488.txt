Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

Bella has 10 earrings, which is 25% of Monica's earrings. This means that Monica has 10 x 4 = 40 earrings.

Monica has twice as many earrings as Rachel. So, Rachel has 40 รท 2 = 20 earrings.

In total, they have 10 + 40 + 20 = 70 earrings.
