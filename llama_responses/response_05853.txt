Let's start by using the information that there are 5 less raspberries than green grapes. Let's say the number of green grapes is x. Then, the number of raspberries is x - 5. We know that there are 7 times the number of red grapes as green grapes. So, the number of red grapes is 7x.

We know that the total number of fruit is 102. So, the equation is: x + (x - 5) + 7x = 102. We can combine the like terms to get 2x - 5 + 7x = 102.

We can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get 2x + 7x + 5 = 102 + 5. The equation now looks like 2x + 7x = 107. We can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get x + 7x = 107 - 2. We can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to get x = 107 - 7.

So, the number of red grapes is 107 - 7 = 100. Therefore, there are 100 red grapes in the salad.

Answer: 100
