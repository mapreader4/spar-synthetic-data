Let's break this problem down step by step.

Galileo is currently paying $20 per month for the car he is renting. If he decides to buy the brand new car that costs $30 per month, he will have to pay for it for a year.

To find the difference, we need to find the total cost of the new car. Since the cost of the new car is $30 per month, the total cost for a year would be:

$30 * 12 = $360

Galileo is currently paying $20 per month for the car he is renting. So, the difference between the cost of the new car and the current rent would be:

$360 - $20 * 12 = $280

So, the answer is:

Answer: 280
