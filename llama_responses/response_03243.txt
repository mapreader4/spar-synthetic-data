Let's start by finding the total number of apples Bella eats in a week. Since she eats 6 apples a day, she eats 6 * 7 = 42 apples in a week.

Then, we need to find out how many apples she will have left after Grace picks a third of the apples. Since Grace picks 1/3 of the apples, she will pick 1/3 * 42 = 14 apples.

Bella eats the same amount of apples as Grace, so Bella will also have 14 apples left. Then, we need to subtract 14 from the total number of apples she has, which is 42. The answer is:

Answer: 28
