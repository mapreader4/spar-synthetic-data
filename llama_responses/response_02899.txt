Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Mark's starting amount of money be x.

When he went to the first store, he spent one-half of his money, so he spent x/2.

Then, he spent $14 more, so he spent x/2 + 14.

Next, he went to another store where he spent one-third of his starting money, which is x/3.

Then, he spent $16 more, so he spent x/3 + 16.

Since he had no money left, this means that the total amount he spent is equal to his starting amount of money.

Let's set up an equation to represent this:

x - (x/2 + 14) - (x/3 + 16) = 0

We can combine the fractions by finding a common denominator, which is 2. So the equation becomes:

2x/2 - x/2 - x/3 - 16 = 0

Now, we can solve for x:

2x - x - x - 32 = 0

Combine like terms:

2x - 2x - 32 = 0

Combine like coefficients:

-2x - 32 = 0

Add 32 to both sides:

-2x = 32

Divide both sides by -2:

x = -16

So, Mark had $16 when he entered the first store.

Answer: 16
