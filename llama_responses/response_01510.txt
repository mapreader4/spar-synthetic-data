Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of junior girls is x.

The number of senior girls is also junior girls. So the total number of girls is x + x.

The total number of players is 50.

We know that the total number of girls is 60, which is 2x. So we know that 2x = 60.

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us x = 30.

So, there are 30 junior girls.
