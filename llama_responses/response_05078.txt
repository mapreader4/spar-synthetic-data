Let's break it down step by step.

Megan bought 2 dozen eggs, which is equal to 24 eggs.

She dropped a tray of eggs, which means she dropped 12 eggs.

3 eggs broke, so 3 eggs are no longer in perfect condition.

Twice as many cracked means that 6 eggs are also no longer in perfect condition.

So, the number of eggs that are still in perfect condition is 24 - 9 = 15.

The number of eggs that are cracked is 9 (3 + 6).

So, the difference between the eggs that are still in perfect condition and those that are cracked is 15 - 9 = 6.

Answer: 6.
