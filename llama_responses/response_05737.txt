Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many candies each of her friends will get. We know that Paula has 20 candies initially, and she needs to give candies to her 6 friends. So, we can set up an equation:

20 - (number of candies Paula has) = (number of candies each friend gets) * 6

We can start by adding 4 candies so that Paula can give an equal number of candies to her friends. So, the new total number of candies is:

20 + 4 =?

We know that 24 is the new total number of candies. Now, we can find the number of candies each friend will get:

24 รท 6 = 4

So, each of Paula's friends will get 4 candies.
