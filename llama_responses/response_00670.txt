Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Gracie is 7 inches shorter than Grayson.
* Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin.
* Griffin is 61 inches tall.

From the information given, we can set up an equation to find the height of Gracie:

Gracie = Grayson - 7
Grayson = Griffin + 2
Grayson = Griffin - 61

We can solve the equation step by step:

Grayson = Griffin - 61 + 2 = Grayson - 59
Grayson - 7 = Grayson - 59
Gracie = Grayson - 7 - 7
Gracie = 59 - 7
Gracie = 52

So, Gracie is 52 inches tall.
