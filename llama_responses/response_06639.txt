Let's break this problem down step by step.

Maria bought the pen for half the price of the pencil. So, the cost of the pencil is twice the price of the pen. If the pencil costs $8, then half the price is half of that, which is:

8 / 2 = 4

The cost of the pencil is $4. So, Maria paid $4 for the pencil. The cost of the pen is $8. So, the total amount she paid is:

8 + 4 = 12

Answer: 12
