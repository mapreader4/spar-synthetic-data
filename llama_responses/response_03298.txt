Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of games Bill has won. He has won 63 games out of 200 games played. So, the percentage of games he won is 63% of 200, which is 0.63 * 200 = 126. So, his total wins are 126.

If he plays 100 more games and loses 43 of them, then he will have a total of 143 games played. 126 of those 143 games are his wins. So, he will have won 126 - 43 = 83 games.

So, his new win percentage is 83 / 143 = 57.5%.

Answer: 57.5
