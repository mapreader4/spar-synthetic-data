Let's break this problem down step by step.

Alex has invited 10 friends, but one of them didn't eat meat and brought their own food. So, he only needs to cook for 9 friends.

For each guest, Alex planned to cook 3 burgers. So, he needs to cook a total of 3 x 9 = 27 burgers.

However, one of his friends didn't eat bread and wouldn't need a bun. So, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of burgers to account for this. This leaves us with 27 - 1 = 26 burgers that need buns.

The burger buns come 8 to a pack. To find out how many packs Alex needs, we can divide the total number of burgers that need buns (26) by 8.

26 รท 8 = 3.25

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, Alex needs to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, he needs to buy 4 packs of buns.

Answer: 4
