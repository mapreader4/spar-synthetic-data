Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Carla needs to dry-clean 80 pieces of laundry, and she starts work at 8 AM. 

Next, we need to find out how many hours she has to work before noon. 

There are 12 hours from 8 AM to 12 PM, which is 12 - 8 = 4 hours. 

Since Carla needs to dry-clean 80 pieces of laundry, and she has 4 hours to do it, we can divide 80 by 4 to find out how many pieces of laundry she needs to clean per hour. 

80 รท 4 = 20

Answer: 20
