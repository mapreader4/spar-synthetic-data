Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of students who are present in the classroom. We know that 3/4 of the students are in the classroom, and we are told that 1/10 of the students are absent. So, the total number of students who are present in the classroom is 3/4 of the total 40 students minus 1/10 of the students.

To find the total number of students who are present in the classroom, we can multiply the total number of students by 3/4, and then subtract 1/10 of the students.

3/4 of 40 students is 30 students. 30 - 4 is 26 students. So, 26 students are in the classroom.

Now, let's find the number of students in the canteen. We know that the total number of students is 40, and we know that 26 students are in the classroom. So, the number of students in the canteen is 40 - 26, which is 14.

Answer: 14
