Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of pencils that Eric has in total. He started with 150 pencils and received 30 more. So, the total number of pencils is 150 + 30 = 180.

Next, we need to divide the total number of pencils into 5 containers. To do this, we can divide 180 by 5. This gives us the number of pencils in each container.

180 รท 5 = 36

Answer: 36
