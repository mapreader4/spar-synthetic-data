Let's break this down step by step.

Julie spent $8 on green lettuce and $6 on red lettuce. We can add these amounts together to find the total amount of money spent on lettuce: $8 + $6 = $14.

Since each type of lettuce costs $2 per pound, we can divide the total amount spent by $2 to find the total number of pounds of lettuce:

$14 / $2 = 7.

So, Julie bought 7 pounds of lettuce.
