Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of pages in the book: 120 pages.

Julie read 12 pages yesterday, so that leaves 120 - 12 = 108 pages left.

Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which means she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages.

So, the number of pages left is 108 - 24 = 84.

So, the number of pages she should read tomorrow is 84.
