Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, the man had 39 cows.

Last year, 25 cows died, so the number of cows decreased by 25. So, the number of cows is now:

39 - 25 = 14

Then, the man sold 6 cows, so the number of cows decreased by 6. So, the number of cows is now:

14 - 6 = 8

This year, the number of cows increased by 24. So, the number of cows is now:

8 + 24 = 32

The man's friend gave him 8 cows as a gift, so the number of cows increased by 8. So, the number of cows is now:

32 + 8 = 40

The man now has 40 cows.
