Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: The total amount of all the items Pauline wants to buy is $150. This is the total amount she wants to spend.

Step 2: The sales tax is 8% of the total amount purchased. To find the sales tax, we need to find 8% of $150.

To find 8% of $150, we can multiply $150 by 0.08.

$150 x 0.08 = $12

Step 3: The total amount Pauline will spend on all the items, including sales tax, is the total amount she wants to buy, plus the sales tax.

The total amount Pauline will spend is $150 + $12.
