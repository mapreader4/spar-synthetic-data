Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* There are 70 cookies in the jar initially.
* There are 28 cookies left after a week.
* Paul took the same amount each day.

We can find the amount Paul took out in four days by subtracting the initial amount from the final amount.

Let's subtract 28 from 70 to find the amount Paul took out in four days:

70 - 28 = 42

So, Paul took out 42 cookies in four days.
