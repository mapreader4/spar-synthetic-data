Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of pencils Ken gave to Manny and Nilo. Ken gave Manny 10 pencils, and then he gave Nilo 10 more pencils than he gave to Manny. So, the total number of pencils Ken gave away is 10 + 10 = 20.

Since Ken started with 50 pencils, he gave away 20 pencils. So, to find the number of pencils Ken kept, we subtract 20 from 50. 50 - 20 = 30.

Answer: 30
