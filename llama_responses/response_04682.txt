To find the average star rating, we need to add up the total number of stars and divide it by the total number of reviews. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of stars. There are 6 x 5-star reviews, 7 x 4-star reviews, 4 x 3-star reviews, and 1 x 2-star review. So, the total number of stars is 6 + 7 + 4 + 2 = 19.

Then, we need to divide the total number of stars by the total number of reviews. The total number of reviews is 18. 

19 / 18 = 1.05.

So, the average star rating for Indigo Restaurant is 1.05 stars.
