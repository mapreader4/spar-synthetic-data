Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of legs in one tarantula egg sac. Since each egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas, and each tarantula has 8 legs, the total number of legs in one egg sac would be 8 x 1000 = 8000 legs.

Now, we need to find the number of legs in less than 5 egg sacs. We can do this by subtracting the legs from the total legs in one egg sac (8000) by the legs in 1 egg sac (8). We get:

8000 - 8 = 7992

So, the answer is:

Answer: 7992
