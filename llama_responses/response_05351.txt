Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The number of patrons who came in cars is 12.
2. The number of patrons who came from the bus is 27.
3. The total number of patrons is the sum of the above two numbers: 12 + 27 = 39.
4. Since Ellen can fit 3 patrons in a golf cart, we need to find the number of golf carts needed to transport all 39 patrons.

To do this, we can divide the total number of patrons (39) by the number of patrons Ellen can fit in a golf cart (3):

39 รท 3 = 13

So, Ellen needs 13 golf carts to transport the patrons from the overflow parking lot to the main lot.
