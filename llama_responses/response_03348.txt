Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Skyler wrote 25 hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts.
* 10 more songs that made it on the top 100 charts than the hit songs.
* 5 fewer songs than the hit songs that were never released.

We can find the total number of songs written by Skyler as follows:

25 (the 25 hit songs) + 10 (the 10 more songs) + 5 (the 5 fewer songs) = 30

So, the answer is:

Answer: 30
