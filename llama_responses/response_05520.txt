Let's break down the cost of the peripherals into parts.

The peripherals cost 1/5 of the cost of the computer, which is $1500. 1/5 of $1500 is $300.

John also wants to upgrade the video card, which costs twice as much as the current video card. The current video card costs $300. Twice that is $600.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the peripherals to the cost of the video card upgrade:

$300 (peripherals) + $600 (video card upgrade) = $900

So John spent $900 in total.
