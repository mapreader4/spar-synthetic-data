Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of plants Mike bought. He bought 6 rose bushes for 75 dollars each, which is a total of 6 x 75 = 450 dollars. He also bought 2 tiger toothbrushes for 100 dollars each, which is a total of 2 x 100 = 200 dollars. So, the total amount he spent on plants for himself is 450 + 200 = 650 dollars.

Answer: 650
