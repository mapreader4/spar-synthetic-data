Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of admission for Kath and her 3 friends. Since the cost is $8, but it's $3 less if you watch the movie before 6 P.M., we can subtract $3 from $8 to get the cost for the early show.

$8 - $3 = $5

So, the cost for Kath and her 3 friends is $5.

Next, we need to add the cost for Kath's 2 siblings. Since the cost is the same as for Kath and her friends, we can add $5 to the total cost for the 2 siblings.

$5 + $5 = $10

So, Kath will pay $10 for all of their admission.
