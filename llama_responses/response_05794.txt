Let's break this down step by step.

Todd starts with $100 and borrows $110 from his brother. So he has a total of $210.

He then spends $75 on ingredients, so he has $210 - $75 = $135 left.

He sells 200 snow cones for $.75 each. So he earns 200 x $.75 = $150.

Todd has $135 left after spending $75 and earning $150. He needs to pay back his brother $110. So he has $135 - $110 = $25 left.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 25
