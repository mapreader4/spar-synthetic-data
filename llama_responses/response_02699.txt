Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with Wednesday. 37 students played kickball, so we know that 37 students played kickball on Wednesday.

Then, let's look at Thursday. 9 students played kickball, which is 9 fewer students who played kickball. But we already know that 37 students played kickball on Wednesday, so we need to subtract 9 from that to find the number of students who played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.

37 - 9 = 28

Answer: 28
