To solve this problem, we can start by using the information given that Grace's tower is 8 times the size of Clyde's tower, which is 40 inches tall.

Let's call the height of Clyde's tower as x. Then, we can write the equation:

8x = 40

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 40 / 8
x = 5

So, the height of Clyde's tower is 5 inches. To find the height of Grace's tower, we can multiply the height of Clyde's tower by 8:

Height of Grace's tower = 5 * 8
Height of Grace's tower = 40

Now, we can find the difference in height between the two towers:

Height of Grace's tower - Height of Clyde's tower = 40 - 5
Height of Grace's tower - Height of Clyde's tower = 35

So, the answer is: Answer: 35
