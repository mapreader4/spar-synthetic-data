Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Kona drives 9 miles to the bakery.
2. From the bakery, Kona drives 24 miles to his grandmother's house.
3. From his grandmother's house, Kona drives 27 miles straight to his apartment.

The total distance to the bakery and back to the grandmother's house is 9 + 24 + 27 = 60 miles.

The round trip to the bakery stop is 9 + 24 + 27 = 60 miles. The round trip without the bakery stop is just 27 + 27 = 54 miles. 

So, the difference is 60 - 54 = 6 miles.

Answer: 6
