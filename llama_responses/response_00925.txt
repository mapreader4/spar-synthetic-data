Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of customers each person served.

Ann and Becky work for 8 hours, and each serves 7 customers per hour. So, Ann and Becky together serve 7 * 8 = 56 customers.

Julia worked for 6 hours, and she serves 7 customers per hour. So, Julia served 7 * 6 = 42 customers.

Step 2: Add the number of customers served by each person.

Ann and Becky served 56 customers, and Julia served 42 customers. To find the total number of customers served by all three women, we add 56 + 42 = 98.

Answer: 98
