Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: We know that the silverware set has 6 knives, 12 forks, and 3 times as many spoons as knives. We can write this as an equation: 6 knives, 12 forks, 3 * 6 knives. The number of spoons is 3 * 6 = 18.

Step 2: We know that Carolyn trades her 10 knives for 6 spoons. This means she gives away 10 knives and receives 6 spoons.

Step 3: We can find the total number of knives, forks, and spoons Carolyn has left: 6 knives - 10 knives = 6 knives, 12 forks, 18 spoons - 6 spoons = 0 knives, 12 forks, 12 spoons.

Step 4: To find the percentage of knives, we can divide the number of knives by the total number of silverware: 0 knives, 12 forks, 12 spoons. The total number of silverware is 12 + 12 + 12 = 36.

Step 5: We can write the percentage as a fraction: 0 knives / 36 = 0 / 36 = 0 / 1 = 0%.

Answer: 0
