Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's first find out how many pencils Bowen buys. Bowen buys 2/5 times more pencils than pens, and since Bowen buys 40 pens, we can set up an equation to find the number of pencils:

40 pens + 2/5x = x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

5(40 + 2x) = 5x
40 + 2x = 5x
2x = 20
x = 10

So Bowen buys 10 pencils.

2. Now, let's calculate the cost of the pens and pencils Bowen buys:

Pens: 40 pens * 0.25 = 10.00
Pencils: 10 pencils * 0.15 = 1.50
Total cost = 10.00 + 1.50 = 11.50

Answer: 11.50
