Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how long it took Paul to walk to the Nile Delta. It took him 4 hours. Then, we need to find out how long it took the group to walk back, which is 4 hours + 2 hours, which is 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the total time the alligators walked. We can do this by adding the time it took Paul to walk to the Nile Delta to the time it took the group to walk back. So, the total time is 4 hours + 6 hours, which is 10 hours.

Answer: 10
