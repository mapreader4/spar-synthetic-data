Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the daily average of the baker's sales.

The baker usually sells 20 pastries and 10 loaves of bread, so his daily average is:

20 pastries x 2 = 40 dollars
10 loaves of bread x 4 = 40 dollars
Total daily average = 40 + 40 = 80 dollars

Now, let's find the total sales for today.

The baker sold 14 pastries for 2 dollars each, which is 14 x 2 = 28 dollars. He sold 25 loaves of bread for 4 dollars each, which is 25 x 4 = 100 dollars. The total sales for today is 28 + 100 = 128 dollars.

To find the difference between the daily average and the total for today, we subtract the total from the average:

128 - 80 = 48

Answer: 48
