Let's break this problem down step by step.

Megan started with a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.

She used 2 eggs for an omelet, so she has 12 - 2 = 10 eggs left.

Then, she used 4 eggs for a cake, so she has 10 - 4 = 6 eggs left.

After giving half of her remaining eggs to her aunt, Megan has 6 / 2 = 3 eggs left.

Now, she wants to divide the remaining 3 meals equally. To do this, we need to divide 3 by 3, because there are 3 meals.

3 รท 3 = 1.
