Let's break it down step by step.

Brenda had 3 litters of 8 mice each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 mice. She gave 1/6 of the baby mice to Robbie, which is 24/6 = 4 mice. She sold 3 times the number of babies she gave Robbie, which is 4 x 3 = 12 mice. Half of the remaining mice were sold to snake owners, which is 24 - 12 - 12/2 = 0 mice.

So, Brenda had 24 - 4 - 12 = 8 mice left.
