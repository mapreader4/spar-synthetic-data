Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

Calvin and Phoebe each have 8 more pastries than Frank, so we can write an equation to represent this information: 

P + P - F = 8

This means that Phoebe and Calvin have 8 more pastries than Frank.

We are also given that Grace has 30 pastries. 

The problem asks for the total number of pastries the four have, which means we need to find the total number of pastries that Calvin, Phoebe, and Frank have. 

We know that Calvin and Phoebe have 8 more pastries than Frank, and that they have a combined total of 8 pastries. We can represent this as 2 x 8 = 16. 

So, Calvin and Phoebe have 16 pastries. 

Now, we know that Grace has 30 pastries. To find the total number of pastries the four have, we need to add the 16 pastries Calvin and Phoebe have to the 30 pastries Grace has. 

16 + 30 = 46

So, the answer is: Answer: 46
