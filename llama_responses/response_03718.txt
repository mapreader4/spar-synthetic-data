Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the initial cost of the amusement park:

Initial cost to open the amusement park: $100,000

Let's calculate the daily operating cost:

Daily operating cost: 1% of the initial cost = 1% x $100,000 = $1,000

The amusement park sells 150 tickets a day for $10 each:

Daily revenue: 150 tickets x $10 = $1,500

Let's calculate the daily profit:

Daily profit = Daily revenue - Daily operating cost = $1,500 - $1,000 = $500

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take to make back the initial investment:

Initial cost to open the amusement park: $100,000

Daily profit: $500

To find out how many days it will take to make back the initial investment, we can divide the initial cost by the daily profit:

$100,000 รท $500 = 200 days

Therefore, it will take 200 days for the amusement park to make back its initial investment.
