Let's start by identifying the ratio of books to pens. The ratio is 7:3, which means for every 7 pens, Arlo needs 3 books. 

Since the total amount of stationery is 400, we need to find the number of books. 

Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. 

Let x be the number of books. 

The ratio 7:3 can be written as a fraction. 

So, we can set up the equation 7x / 3 = 400. 

Cross-multiply the 3. 

3x = 400 * 7 

Now, we can solve for x. 

x = 400 * 7 / 3 

x = 133.33 

So, the number of books Arlo bought is 133. 

Answer: 133
