Let's break it down step by step.

1. Vikki worked 42 hours in one week. So, her total earnings are 42 * 10 = 420 dollars.

2. 20% of 420 is 0.2 * 420 = 84 dollars, which is the tax deduction.

3. 5% of 420 is 0.05 * 420 = 21 dollars, which is the insurance cover.

4. 5 dollars is deducted for union dues, so that's another 5 dollars.

So, the total deduction is 84 + 21 + 5 = 110. Subtracting this from the total earnings, we get 420 - 110 = 310.

Answer: 310
