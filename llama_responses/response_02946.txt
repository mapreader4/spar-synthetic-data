Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the sisters have 25 dollars with them.  They go to the movies and buy two movie tickets, which are 8 dollars each.  That's a total of 16 dollars for the two tickets.

To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the tickets from the 25 dollars they have.  25 - 16 is 9.

Answer: 9
