Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's find the average number of billboards Benjamin saw per hour. To do this, we need to find the total number of billboards he saw and divide it by the number of hours.

Benjamin saw 17 billboards in the first hour, 20 in the second hour, and 23 in the third hour. To find the total number of billboards, we add these numbers together:

17 + 20 + 23 = 60

So, Benjamin saw a total of 60 billboards.

He drove for 3 hours, so we divide the total number of billboards by the number of hours:

60 รท 3 = 20

So, Benjamin should tell James that the average number of billboards they've seen per hour is 20.

Answer: 20
