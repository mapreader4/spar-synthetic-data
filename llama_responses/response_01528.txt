Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of money Gabby has. Gabby has $35 in her pocket and her mom gave her an additional $20, so she has a total of $35 + $20 = $55.

The makeup set costs $65, so Gabby needs to buy the set. To find out how much money Gabby needs, we subtract the money she has from the cost of the set: $65 - $55 = $10.

So, the answer is: Answer: 10
