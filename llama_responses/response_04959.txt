Let's break it down step by step.

Meryll wants to write 35 multiple-choice questions and 15 problem-solving questions. We know that she has already written 2/5 of the multiple-choice questions, so that's 2 * 5 = 10. She has also written 1/3 of the problem-solving questions, so that's 1/3 * 15 = 5.

To find out how many more questions she needs to write for both multiple-choice and problem-solving, we need to subtract the number of questions she has already written from the total number of questions she wants to write.

For multiple-choice questions, she needs to write 35 - 10 = 25 more questions.

For problem-solving questions, she needs to write 15 - 5 = 10 more questions.

So, Meryll needs to write 25 more multiple-choice questions and 10 more problem-solving questions.
