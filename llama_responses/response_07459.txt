Let's start by letting's say the amount Mathilda owed be x.

Since she paid an initial installment of $125, she still has 75% of the total amount left to pay.

Let's solve the equation 75% of x = 125.

We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 to get:

100% of the total amount = 75% of the total amount

100x = 75x

Now, we can divide both sides by 100 to get the value of x:

x = 75x / 100

x = 0.75x

Now, we can solve for x:

0.75x = 125

x = 125 / 0.75

x = 166.67

So Mathilda owed 166.67.
