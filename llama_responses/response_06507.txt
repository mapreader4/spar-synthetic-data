Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: We are given that there were 2450 sheets of paper that were evenly split into 5 binders. This means that each binder has 2450/5 = 490 sheets of paper.

Step 2: Justine took a binder and colored on one-half of the sheets of paper. To find the number of sheets of paper Justine used, we need to find one-half of 490. One-half of 490 is 490/2 = 245.

Answer: 245
