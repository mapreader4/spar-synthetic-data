To find the total cost of the two appliances, we need to first find the cost of the washing machine and the dryer separately.

The cost of the washing machine is $100.
The cost of the dryer is $100 - $30 = $70.

The total cost of the two appliances is $100 + $70 = $170.

Hannah got a 10% discount for buying two appliances, so we need to subtract 10% of the total cost.

10% of $170 is $17.

The final cost of the two appliances after the discount is $170 - $17 = $153.

Answer: 153
