Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the points from the bullseye:

1. The bullseye is worth 50 points.
2. The dart that missed the target is worth 0 points.
3. The third dart is worth half the points of the bullseye. 50 / 2 is 25.

So, the total points from the bullseye and the third dart is 50 + 25 = 75.

The dart that missed the target is worth 0 points, so the total score is 75 + 0 = 75.

Answer: 75
