Let's break this down step by step.

1. James has five huskies, two pitbulls, and four golden retrievers.
2. The golden retrievers had two more pups than each husky. So, each golden retriever had 2 + 2 = 4 pups.
3. Since each husky had 3 pups, the total number of pups from the huskies is 5 x 3 = 15.
4. The pitbulls had 3 pups each, so the total number of pups from the pitbulls is 2 x 3 = 6.
5. The total number of pups from the huskies and pitbulls is 15 + 6 = 21.
6. There are 4 golden retrievers, and each had 4 pups, so the total number of pups from the golden retrievers is 4 x 4 = 16.
7. The total number of pups from all the dogs is 21 (huskies and pitbulls) + 16 (golden retrievers) = 37.
