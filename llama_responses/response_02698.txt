Let's start by counting the total number of walls in the house. There are 5 rooms with 4 walls each, so that's 5 x 4 = 20 walls. There are also 4 rooms with 5 walls each, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 walls. In total, there are 20 + 20 = 40 walls.

Since there are 5 people in Amanda's family, to divide the work equally among them, we can divide the total number of walls by 5. 40 รท 5 = 8.
