To find the area of the remaining units, we can find the area of the 20 units that are 8 by 4 feet each. The area of these 20 units is 8 x 4 = 32 square feet. Since the total area of all the remaining units is 5040 square feet, the area of one of the remaining units is 5040 - 32 = 5008 square feet. Answer: 5008
