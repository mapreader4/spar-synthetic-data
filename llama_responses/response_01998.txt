Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of marbles Harold has left after keeping 20 marbles for himself. He has 100 marbles initially, so he has 100 - 20 = 80 marbles left.

He has to divide these 80 marbles among his 5 friends. To do this, we can divide 80 by 5, which is the same as 80 รท 5 = 16.

So each friend gets 16 marbles.
