Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's calculate how much he makes per hour in his old job:

Old job: 25 hours a week * $16 per hour = $400 per week
$400 per week * 52 weeks per year = $20,800 per year

Let's calculate how much he makes per hour in his new job:

New job: 40 hours a week * $20 per hour = $800 per week
$800 per week * 52 weeks per year = $41,600 per year

Now, let's find out how much more he makes in his new job than his old job:

$41,600 per year - $20,800 per year = $20,480

So, he makes $20,480 more per year in his new job than his old job.

Answer: 20,480
