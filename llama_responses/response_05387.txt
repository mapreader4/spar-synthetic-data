Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in the first half of the month. Since he receives 20 emails a day, and there are 15 days in the first half of April, the total number of emails would be:

20 emails/day * 15 days = 300

Now, halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day. So, the number of emails per day is now 20 + 5 = 25.

So, for the second half of the month, the total number of emails would be:

25 emails/day * 15 days = 375

To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month, we add the number of emails in the first half and the second half:

300 + 375 = 675

So, the answer is:

Answer: 675
