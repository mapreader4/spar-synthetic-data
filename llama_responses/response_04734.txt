Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of chairs of each color.

* Blue chairs: 10
* Green chairs: 10 * 3 = 30 (since green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs)
* White chairs: 30 + 10 - 13 = 17 (since there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined)

Now, let's add the number of chairs of each color to get the total number of chairs in the classroom.

10 (blue) + 30 (green) + 17 (white) = 57

Answer: 57
