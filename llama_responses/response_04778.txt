To find the amount Karsyn paid, we can use the formula for percentage discount, which is the original price minus the discount.

Let's start by identifying the original price: the phone's initial price is $600.

The discount is 20%, which is 20% of the original price. To find 20% of $600, we can multiply 20 by 0.2 (which is 20/100), since we are finding a percentage.

20 * 0.2 = 12

Now, we can subtract the discount from the original price to find the amount Karsyn paid:

$600 - $12 = $588

So, Karsyn paid $588.
