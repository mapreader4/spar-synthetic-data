Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the variables. Let's say x be the number of hours these children watch television in 2 weeks.

We know that each child watches 45 minutes of television each day, and they watch television 4 days a week. So, the total number of minutes they watch television in a week is:

45 minutes x 4 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

180 minutes รท 60 = 3 hours

Now, we know that 3 hours is the total number of hours these children watch television in a week. Since we want to know how many hours they watch in 2 weeks, we can multiply the total hours by 2:

3 hours x 2 = 6

Answer: 6
