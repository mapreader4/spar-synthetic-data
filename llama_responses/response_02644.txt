Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Carl needs to sell 96 cupcakes in 2 days.
2. He needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment.
3. So, he needs to sell 96 - 24 = 72 cupcakes in 2 days.

4. To find out how many cupcakes Carl needs to sell per day, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes he needs to sell (72) by the number of days (2).
