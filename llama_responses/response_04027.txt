Let's break this down step by step.

Lionel bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos.

To make an Oreo cheesecake, Lionel needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos.

To find the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes Lionel can make, we need to divide the total number of Oreos by 3. 15 packets of Oreos divided by 3 is 5.

So, Lionel can make 5 Oreo cheesecakes.

Each Oreo cheesecake requires 2 boxes of Graham crackers. So, Lionel uses 2 * 5 = 10 boxes of Graham crackers for the Oreo cheesecakes.

Lionel bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers initially. After using 10 boxes for the Oreo cheesecakes, he has:

14 - 10 = 4

So, Lionel has 4 boxes of Graham crackers left over.
