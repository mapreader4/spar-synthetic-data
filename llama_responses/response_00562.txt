Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the mom, who eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day. In one day, the mom will eat 1.5 * 3 = 4.5 cups of food.

Now, let's move on to the puppies. There are 5 puppies, and each puppy eats 1/2 cup of food, twice a day. So, for one day, each puppy will eat 1/2 * 2 = 1 cup of food. Since there are 5 puppies, the total amount of food the puppies will eat in one day is 1 * 1 = 5 cups.

For the next 6 days, the total amount of food the mom will need is the amount the mom eats in one day (4.5 cups) plus the total amount the puppies will eat in one day (5 cups) times the number of days (6). This is 4.5 + 5 * 6 = 34.5 cups.

Answer: 34.5
