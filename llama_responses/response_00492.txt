Let's start by finding the total number of Judges who are under 30 years old.

10% of 40 Judges are under 30 years old. 10% of 40 is 4. So, there are 4 Judges who are under 30 years old.

Next, we find the number of Judges who are 30-50 years old.

60% of 40 Judges are 30-50 years old. 60% of 40 is 24. So, there are 24 Judges who are 30-50 years old.

Now, we find the number of Judges who are over 50 years old.

The total number of Judges is 40. So, the number of Judges who are over 50 years old is 40 - 4 - 24 = 12.

Answer: 12
