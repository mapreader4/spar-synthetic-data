Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Pam's balance was x at the beginning of the year.

At the end of the year, her balance tripled. So, her balance is now 3x.

She withdrew $250 at the end of the year.

So, the equation becomes:

3x - 250 = 950

To solve for x, we can add 250 to both sides of the equation:

3x = 950 + 250

3x = 1200

So, Pam had $400 in the bank account at the beginning of the year.

Answer: 400
