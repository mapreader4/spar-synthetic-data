Let's break down the time it takes Martha to knit each item:

* Hat: 2 hours
* Scarf: 3 hours
* Mitten: 1 hour
* Sock: 1.5 hours
* Sweater: 6 hours

Since there are three grandchildren, Martha needs to knit three of each item. Let's calculate the total time for each item:

* Hats: 3 x 2 hours = 6 hours
* Scarves: 3 x 3 hours = 9 hours
* Mittens: 3 x 1 hour = 3 hours
* Socks: 3 x 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours
* Sweaters: 3 x 6 hours = 18 hours

Now, let's add up the total time it takes Martha to knit all the outfits:

6 hours (hats) + 9 hours (scarves) + 3 hours (mittens) + 4.5 hours (socks) + 18 hours (sweaters) = 40.5 hours
