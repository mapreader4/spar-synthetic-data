Let's break this down step by step!

Initially, the box weighs 0 pounds. Ken adds enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds, so the weight is now 2 pounds.

Then, he adds enough brownies to triple the weight. Since the weight is now 2 pounds, tripling it would make it 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Next, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans, making the total weight 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.

Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. Since the weight is now 8 pounds, doubling it would make it 8 x 2 = 16 pounds.

So, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.

Answer: 16
