Let's break this down step by step.

A kilogram of pork costs $6. A kilogram of chicken costs $2 less, so a kilogram of chicken costs $6 - $2 = $4.

We need to find the cost of 3 kilograms of chicken. Since a kilogram of chicken costs $4, 3 kilograms of chicken will cost 3 times that amount. So, 3 x $4 = $12.

Then, we need to add the cost of the pork. A kilogram of pork costs $6, so the total cost of the 3-kilogram of pork is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the 3-kilogram of chicken and a kilogram of pork is $12 + $18 = $30.
