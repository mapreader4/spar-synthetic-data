To solve this problem, I will think step by step.

First, I will find the total cost of the toys if there is no discount. Since each toy costs 3 dollars, and John buys 5 toys, the total cost would be:

5 * 3 = 15

Next, I will find the discount. The discount is 20%, so I will multiply the total cost by 0.2 to find the discount:

0.2 * 15 = 3

To find the final cost, I will subtract the discount from the total cost:

15 - 3 = 12

So, John paid 12 dollars for everything.
