Let's break down the information given to us:

There are 200 more red apples than green apples, which means that there are 200 - 32 = 168 red apples.

After the truck arrives, 340 green apples are added to the store. The total number of green apples is now 32 + 340 = 372.

To find the difference between the number of green apples and the number of red apples, we subtract 372 from 168.

So, there are 372 - 168 = 204 more green apples than red apples in the store now.
