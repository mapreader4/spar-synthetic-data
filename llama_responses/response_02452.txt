Let's call the number of birds on the fence x.

The statement "Ten more than twice the number of birds on the fence is 50" can be written as the equation 10 + 2x = 50.

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 20.

So, the number of birds on the fence is 20.
