To find the amount Zane paid for the shirts, we need to first find the discount amount and then add that to the regular price.

The discount is 40% off, so the discount amount is 0.4 x 50 = 20. So the discounted price is 50 - 20 = 30.

Zane paid 2 shirts at the discounted price of 30 each. So, the total amount he paid is 2 x 30 = 60.

Answer: 60
