Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of red beads. We know that there are twice as many red beads as green beads, and there are 3 green beads, so the number of red beads is 3 x 2 = 6.

Now, we know that the pattern repeats 3 times per bracelet and 5 times per necklace. So, for 1 bracelet, the number of beads is 3 x (3) = 9. For 10 necklaces, the number of beads is 5 x 10 = 50.

To find the total number of beads needed for 1 bracelet and 10 necklaces, we can add the number of beads for each. 9 + 50 = 59.

Answer: 59
