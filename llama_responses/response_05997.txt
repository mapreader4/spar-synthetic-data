Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, let's calculate the total number of settings needed:

15 tables with 8 settings each = 15 x 8 = 120 settings
Plus 20 backup settings = 120 + 20 = 140 settings

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the silverware:

Each piece of silverware weighs 4 ounces, and there are 3 pieces per setting. So, the total weight of silverware per setting is:
3 x 4 ounces = 12 ounces per setting

For 140 settings, the total weight of silverware is:
12 ounces per setting x 140 settings = 1680 ounces

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the plates:

Each plate weighs 12 ounces, and there are 2 plates per setting. So, the total weight of plates per setting is:
2 x 12 ounces = 24 ounces per setting

For 140 settings, the total weight of plates is:
24 ounces per setting x 140 settings = 3360 ounces

Now, let's add the total weight of silverware and plates:
1680 ounces (silverware) + 3360 ounces (plates) = 5040 ounces

Answer: 5040
