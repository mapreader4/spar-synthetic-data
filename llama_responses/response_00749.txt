Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Andrea has 4 erasers. We also know that Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea. This means that we can represent the number of erasers Anya has as 4 * 4 = 16.

Since Andrea has 4 erasers, we can subtract the number of erasers Andrea has from the number of erasers Anya has to find the difference. This is done by subtracting 4 from 16, which gives us 12.

Answer: 12
