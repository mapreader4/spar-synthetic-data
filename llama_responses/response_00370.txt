Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. First, let's find the number of patients that require standard care. Since 1/3 of the 12 patients have special dietary requirements, that means 4 patients require special care. The remaining 8 patients require standard care.

2. The time it takes to serve each standard care patient is 5 minutes. So, the total time it takes to serve the 8 standard care patients is 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

3. The patients with special dietary requirements take 20% more time to serve, so the time it takes to serve each of these patients is 5 * 1.2 = 6 minutes.

4. The total time it takes to serve all 4 special care patients is 4 * 6 = 24 minutes.

5. The total time it takes to serve all patients is the sum of the time it takes to serve standard care patients and special care patients. So, the total time is 40 + 24 = 64 minutes.

Answer: 64
