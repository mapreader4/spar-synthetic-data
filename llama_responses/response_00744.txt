Let's break this down step by step.

1. Yolanda leaves home at 7:00 AM and rides her bike at 20 miles per hour. So, the time it takes her to get to work is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 20 miles / 20 mph = 0.5 hours = 30 minutes

2. 15 minutes after she leaves, her husband jumps in the car to bring her lunch to her. This means that he starts 15 minutes after her, and he is going at 40 miles per hour. So, the time it takes him to catch her is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 0.75 hours = 45 minutes

3. We need to subtract the time it takes her to get to work from the time it takes him to catch her. So, the time it takes him to catch her is:

Time = 45 minutes - 30 minutes = 15 minutes

Answer: 15
