Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Hadley walked 2 miles to the grocery store in his boots.
2. Then, he walked 1 less than two miles to the pet store in his boots. 1 less than 2 miles is 2 - 1 = 1 mile.
3. Then, he walked one less than four miles back home in his boots. One less than 4 miles is 4 - 1 = 3 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the three distances: 2 miles (to the grocery store) + 1 mile (to the pet store) + 3 miles (back home) = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 miles.
