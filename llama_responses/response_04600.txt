Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of candy bars Nick needs to sell to reach his goal of $1000 is x.

Each candy bar costs $5, so the total cost of the candy bars will be 5x.

Each chocolate orange costs $10, so the total cost of the chocolate oranges is 10.

Nick wants to raise a total of $1000. So, the total cost of the candy bars and chocolate oranges should be $1000.

The cost of the chocolate oranges is $20 (since there are 20 of them), so we can subtract that from the total cost to get the cost of the candy bars.

$1000 - $20 = $980

The cost of the candy bars is 5x, so we can set up the equation 5x = 980.

We can divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get x = 196.

Answer: 196
