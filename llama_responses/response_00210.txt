Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of cars Bobby has in 1 year. Since the number of cars increases by 50%, we can write an equation to represent the number of cars Bobby has in 1 year as 16 * 1.5, because 50% is the same as 1/2, and multiplying by 1.5 is the same as multiplying by 2 and then dividing by 2, which is the same as multiplying by 1.5.

Now, to find the number of cars Bobby has in 2 years, we can multiply the number of cars he has in 1 year by 1.5 again, since the number of cars increases by 50% every year. This gives us 16 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 24.

To find the number of cars Bobby has in 3 years, we can multiply the number of cars he has in 2 years by 1.5 again, since the number of cars increases by 50% every year. This gives us 24 * 1.5 = 36.

Answer: 36
