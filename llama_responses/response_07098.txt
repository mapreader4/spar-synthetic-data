Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of fleas each chicken has:

* Gertrude has 10 fleas.
* Maud has 5 times the amount of fleas as Olive, so Maud has 5 * 10 = 50 fleas.
* Olive has half the amount of fleas as Gertrude, so Olive has 10 / 2 = 5 fleas.

Now, let's add up the total number of fleas:

10 (Gertrude) + 50 (Maud) + 5 (Olive) = 65

Answer: 65
