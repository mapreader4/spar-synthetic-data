Let's break it down step by step.

A pack of pretzels costs 4 dollars. A pack of chips is 75% more expensive than a pack of pretzels, so a pack of chips is 4 + 0.75 * 4 = 4 + 3 = 7 dollars. Maciek bought 2 packets of chips and 2 packets of pretzels. So, he paid 2 * 7 = 14 dollars for the chips and 2 * 4 = 8 dollars for the pretzels. In total, he paid 14 + 8 = 22 dollars.
