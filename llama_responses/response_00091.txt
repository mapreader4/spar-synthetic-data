Let's break this down step by step.

John makes $80 a day for an 8-hour workday, which means he makes $80/8 = $10 per hour.

If he decides to work an extra 2 hours, his new workday will be 10 hours. To calculate his new daily wage, we need to add the performance bonus of $20 to his original wage:

$80 + $20 = $100

Now, we need to divide the new daily wage by the new workday of 10 hours to find his new hourly wage:

$100 / 10 hours = $10 per hour

So, John makes $10 per hour if he decides to earn the performance bonus.
