Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the capacity of the second bowl is x.

Then, the capacity of the first bowl is 3/4x.

The total number of marbles in both bowls is the sum of the marbles in the first bowl and the marbles in the second bowl. The first bowl has 3/4x marbles, and the second bowl has x marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 3/4x + x.

We are given that the second bowl has 600 marbles, so we can set up an equation:

3/4x + x = 600

To solve for x, we can subtract 3/4 from both sides of the equation:

x = (600 - 3/4x)/3/4

To simplify the right side of the equation, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = (600 - 3x)/3

We can now solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

x = (600 - 3x)/3/3

x = (200)/1

x = 200

Answer: 200
