Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Henry gets $5 to paint the bike. Then, for every bike he sells, he is paid $8 more than he is paid to paint the bike. 

Let's say the number of bikes he sells is x.

Then, we can write an equation to represent this information:

5 + 8x = amount of money he gets paid for selling x bikes.

This is because he gets $5 to paint the bike, and then he gets $8 more for each bike he sells.

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

5 + 8x = 5 + 8x - 5

This simplifies to:

8x - 5 = 0

Then, we can add 5 to both sides to get:

8x = 5

So, the number of bikes he sells is 5. 

Answer: 5
