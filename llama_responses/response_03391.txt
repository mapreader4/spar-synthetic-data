Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kelly spent 1 day traveling on the first day.
2. Then, she spent the next 5 days at her Grandparents' house.
3. The next day, she spent traveling.
4. Then, she spent the next 5 days at her brother's house.
5. Then, she spent 2 days traveling to her sister's house.
6. She spent several days at her sister's house (we don't know the exact number of days yet).
7. Finally, she spent 2 more days traveling home.

Let's add up the days spent at her Grandparents' house, brother's house, and sister's house:

5 days at Grandparents' house + 2 days traveling + 5 days at brother's house + 2 days traveling + several days at sister's house + 2 days traveling =?

The total number of days spent at her sister's house is unknown, so let's call it x.

The total number of days spent traveling is 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.

The total number of days spent at her relatives' houses is 5 + 5 + x + 2 = 12 + x.

The total number of days in the entire vacation is 21.

So, the equation becomes:

12 + x = 21 - 6

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:

x = 5

Answer: 5
