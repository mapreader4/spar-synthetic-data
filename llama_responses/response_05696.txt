Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of days Georgina has had the parrot is x.

Since the parrot knew 3 phrases when Georgina bought it, it has learned 17 - 3 = 14 phrases in total.

Georgina teaches the parrot 2 phrases a week. So, we can set up an equation to represent the number of weeks it has had the parrot: 2 x x = 14.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: 2 x x = 14 / 2 = x = 7.

So, Georgina has had the parrot for 7 days.
