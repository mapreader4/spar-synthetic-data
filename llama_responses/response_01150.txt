Let's break it down step by step.

The driver travels 30 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means the distance covered in this time is 30 * 3 = 90 miles. The driver then travels 25 miles per hour for 4 hours, which is 25 * 4 = 100 miles. The total distance travelled in a week is 90 + 100 = 190 miles.

Answer: 190
