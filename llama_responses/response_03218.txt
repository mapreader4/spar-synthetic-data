Let's start by using the information that Jerry won 7 games. We know that Dave won 3 more games than Jerry, so Dave won 7 + 3 = 10 games. We also know that Ken won 5 more games than Dave, so Ken won 10 + 5 = 15 games.

The total number of games they played is the sum of the games won by each of them, which is 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.
