Let's start by calculating the total cost of the seeds, fertilizers, and labor:

$50 (seeds) + $35 (fertilizers) + $15 (labor) = $100

The total cost is $100.

After harvesting 10 bags of corn, the total revenue is:

10 * (price per bag) = 10x

To make a profit of 10%, the price of each bag should be:

(100 + 10) / 10 = 11

So, the answer is: Answer: 11
