Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: We know that Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg. So, the population of Salem is 58940 * 15 = 883100.

Step 2: 130000 people move out of Salem, which means the population of Salem decreases by 130000.

Step 3: The population of Salem is now 883100 - 130000 = 753100.

Step 4: Half of Salem's population is women. Since the total population is 753100, half of it is 753100 / 2 = 376550.

Answer: 376550
