Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the cost of 24 lighters at the gas station is 24 x $1.75 = $42.00. On the other hand, a pack of 12 lighters costs $5.00. So, to buy 2 packs of 12 lighters, it would cost 2 x $5.00 = $10.00.

To buy 24 lighters online, it would cost $10.00 + $1.75 per lighter = $24.00.

So, Amanda would save $42.00 - $24.00 = $18.00 by buying 24 lighters online instead of at the gas station.
