Let's break it down step by step.

Sally started with 14 fries.
She received one-third of Mark's 36 fries. To find one-third of 36, we can divide 36 by 3: 36 รท 3 = 12. So, Mark gave her 12 fries.

To find out how many fries Sally had in total, we need to add the 14 she started with and the 12 she received: 14 + 12 = 26.

Answer: 26
