Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

Let's start by calculating the total number of seeds from the fruits Steven has set aside:

Apples: 4
Pears: 3
Grapes: 9

Total seeds set aside: 4 + 3 + 9 = 16

Steven needs to collect 60 seeds in total. To find out how many more seeds he needs, we subtract the seeds he has from the total seeds needed:

60 (total seeds needed) - 16 (seeds set aside) = 44

So, Steven needs 44 more seeds to fulfill his assignment.
