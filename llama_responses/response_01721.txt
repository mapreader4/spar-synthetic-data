Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Evan's dog weighs 63 pounds. We also know that Ivan's dog weighs 7 times less than Evan's dog. 

Let's use the information to set up an equation. If Ivan's dog weighs 7 times less than Evan's dog, then Ivan's dog's weight can be represented as 63 - 7x. We know that Ivan's dog's weight is 63 - 7x = 56 pounds. 

Now, we can find the total weight of the dogs. Evan's dog weighs 63 pounds, and Ivan's dog weighs 56 pounds. To find the total weight of the dogs, we add the weights of the two dogs together. 

63 + 56 = 119.

Answer: 119
