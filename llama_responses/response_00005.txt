Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of flowers of each color:

* Yellow flowers: 10
* Purple flowers: 10 x 1.8 = 18 (since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, so 10 x 1.8 = 18)
* Green flowers: 10 x 0.25 = 2.5 (since there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, so 10 x 0.25 = 2.5)

Now, let's add up the number of flowers of each color:

10 + 18 + 2.5 = 28.5

However, this is a fraction. To convert it to an integer, we can round it to the nearest whole number. In this case, the nearest whole number is 29.

Answer: 29
