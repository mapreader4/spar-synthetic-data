Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Find the length of the rectangle. Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 30 inches, and the width is 4 inches, the length of the rectangle is 30 - 2(4) = 26 inches.

Step 2: Find the area of the rectangle. The formula to find the area of a rectangle is length x width, which is 26 x 4 = 104.

Answer: 104.
