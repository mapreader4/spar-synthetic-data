Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The team won 40 games in their last competition. So, let's call this number "x".

2. In the next competition, they won 5/8 times as many games as they won in their first competition. So, we can set up an equation to represent this: 5/8 * x = y. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 8 to get 5x = y.

3. In the third competition, they won the same number of games as the sum of the first and second competition winnings. So, the number of games won in the third competition is x + y.

4. Now, we need to add up the number of games won in all three competitions. So, we add x + 5x + x, which is the same as x + 5x.

Answer: x + 40 + 5x.
