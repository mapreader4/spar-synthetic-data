Let's start by finding the total amount of money the kids have. Each kid gets 4 times the amount of money, so the total amount of money the kids have is 4 x 1.5 = 6. After spending half of that money on dinner, the kids have 3 dollars left. Each bag of corn seeds costs 48 seeds, and each ear of corn requires 2 seeds, so each bag of corn seeds can plant 24 ears of corn. The kids spend 3 dollars on dinner, so they have 3 dollars left. So, they can buy 3/3 of a bag of corn seeds, which is 1 bag of corn seeds.
