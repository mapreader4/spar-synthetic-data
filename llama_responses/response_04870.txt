Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The ticket price for adults is $26. The ticket price for children is half of that, which is $13.

2. The total number of adults is 183. The total number of children is 28.

3. The total revenue from adults is 183 x $26 = 4758.

4. The total revenue from children is 28 x $13 = 364.

5. The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from adults and children: 4758 + 364 = 5122.

Answer: 5122
