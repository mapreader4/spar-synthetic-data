To find the area of the glass that James needs, we need to find the area of the three walls.

The two walls that are 30 feet by 12 feet are 30 * 12 = 360 square feet.

The third wall is 20 feet by 12 feet, so its area is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

The total area of the glass that James needs is the sum of these two areas: 360 + 240 = 600 square feet.

Answer: 600
