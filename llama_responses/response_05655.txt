Let's break it down step by step:

1. During weekdays (Monday to Friday), Lolita can drink 3 boxes of milk.
2. On Saturdays, she can drink twice the number of boxes of milk as on the weekdays, which is 3 * 2 = 6 boxes.
3. On Sundays, she can drink thrice the number of boxes of milk as on the weekdays, which is 3 * 3 = 9 boxes.

To find the total number of boxes of milk Lolita drinks per week, we add up the number of boxes she drinks on each day:

Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 3 boxes
Saturdays: 6 boxes
Sundays: 9 boxes

Total: 3 + 6 + 9 = 18 boxes

Answer: 18
