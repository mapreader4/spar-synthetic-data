Let's start by thinking step by step.

Let's say the width of each level is 7 pieces. Let's call this the base of the tower.

Let's say the tower has n levels. Then, the total number of pieces would be 7 * n.

Since Jade has 100 pieces left, we know that 7 * n = 100. We can solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

7 * n = 100

To do this, we can divide both sides by 7:

n = 100 / 7

n = 14

So, Jade's tower has 14 levels.

Answer: 14
