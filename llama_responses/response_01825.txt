Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the amount of money that Tom's pet insurance will cover.  The insurance covers all but 20% of the surgery cost. 20% of $5000 is 20% * $5000 = $1000.  The insurance will cover $1000.

Next, let's find the cost of the surgery.  The surgery cost $5000.

Now, let's find the amount of money Tom saved by having insurance.  The insurance will save him $5000 - $1000 = $4000.

Answer: 4000.
