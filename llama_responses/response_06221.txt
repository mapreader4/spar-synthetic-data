Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. There are 50 students from Know It All High School.
2. There are 3/5 times as many students from Karen High School as from Know It All High School. To find the number of students from Karen High School, we can multiply 50 by 3/5:

50 x 3/5 = 30

So, there are 30 students from Karen High School.
3. The combined number of students from the first two schools (Know It All High School and Karen High School) is 50 + 30 = 80.
4. Twice the combined number of students from the first two schools is 2 x 80 = 160.
5. The total number of students at the competition is the sum of the students from the three schools: 50 + 30 + 160 = 240.

Answer: 240
