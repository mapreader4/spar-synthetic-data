Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Selma has 50 marbles.

We are told that the two of them together have five fewer marbles than Selma. So, let's say that the two of them together have 50 - 5 = 45 marbles.

Now, we know that Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot. So, we can set up an equation to represent this: M = 2E.

We are given that M is equal to the number of marbles Merill has. And we know that M + E = 45, because the two of them together have 45 marbles.

To solve for M, we can subtract E from both sides of the equation: M = 2E - E = 45. This leaves us with M = 45 - E.

M is equal to 45 - E. We are given that M is equal to the number of marbles Merill has. So, we can conclude that Merill has 45 - 45 = 15 marbles.

Answer: 15
