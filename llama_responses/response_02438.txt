Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that Lily has 3 tennis balls. We also know that Brian has twice as many tennis balls as Frodo, and Frodo has 8 more tennis balls than Lily.

Let's start by finding out how many tennis balls Frodo has. Since Lily has 3 tennis balls, and Frodo has 8 more tennis balls than Lily, we can set up the equation as follows:

Frodo has 3 + 8 tennis balls.

Frodo has 11 tennis balls.

Now, Brian has twice as many tennis balls as Frodo, so Brian has:

11 * 2 =?

To find the answer, we multiply 11 by 2, which gives us:

11 * 2 = 22

Answer: 22
