Let's break this down step by step:

1. Randy drew 5 pictures.
2. Peter drew 3 more pictures than Randy. So, Peter drew 5 + 3 = 8 pictures.
3. Quincy drew 20 more pictures than Peter. So, Quincy drew 8 + 20 = 28 pictures.

To find the total number of pictures they drew, we add the number of pictures drawn by Randy, Peter, and Quincy:

5 + 8 + 28 = 41

Answer: 41
