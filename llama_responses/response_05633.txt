Let's break down the information:

We know that Thomas has 25 drawings in total.
We know that 14 of the drawings were made using colored pencils.
We know that 7 of the drawings were made using blending markers.

To find the number of charcoal drawings, we need to subtract the number of drawings made using colored pencils and drawings made using blending markers from the total number of drawings.

Number of drawings made using colored pencils: 14
Number of drawings made using blending markers: 7

Total number of drawings: 25

Subtracting the number of drawings made using colored pencils and blending markers from the total number of drawings:

25 - 14 - 7 = 4

Answer: 4
