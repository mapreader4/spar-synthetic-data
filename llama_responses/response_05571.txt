Let's start by using the information that Noah ate 8 burgers. Since a burger weighs 5 ounces, Noah ate 8 x 5 = 40 ounces of burgers.

Now, let's think about Jacob's eating. We know that Jacob eats three fewer pies than Noah eats burgers. Since Noah ate 8 burgers, Jacob eats 8 - 3 = 5 pies. Since a pie weighs 10 ounces, Jacob ate 5 x 10 = 50 ounces of pies.

Next, let's think about Mason's eating. We know that Mason eats 3 times as many hot dogs as the number of pies consumed by Jacob. Since Jacob ate 5 pies, Mason ate 3 x 5 = 15 hot dogs. Since a hot dog weighs 2 ounces, Mason ate 15 x 2 = 30 ounces of hot dogs.

Answer: 30
