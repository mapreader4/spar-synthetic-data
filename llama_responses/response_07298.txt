Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total distance the car has traveled, which is 275 km. 

Next, let's calculate the total amount of fuel consumed by the car. The total fuel consumed is 47 liters and the remaining fuel left is 14 liters. 

So, the total fuel consumed is 47 - 14 = 33 liters. 

The distance per 100 km is 275 km, the fuel consumption is 33 liters per 100 km. 

Answer: 33.
