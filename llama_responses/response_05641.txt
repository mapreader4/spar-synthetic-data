Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of words Keenan needs to write.

Keenan needs to write 1200 words.

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours she writes 400 words per hour for the first two hours.

She writes 400 words in 1 hour, so for 2 hours, she writes 400 * 2 = 800 words.

Step 3: Calculate the number of words she writes per hour after the first two hours.

After the first two hours, she writes 200 words per hour.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours she needs to write after the first two hours.

She needs to write 1200 - 800 = 400 words more. To write 200 words per hour, she needs 400 / 200 = 2 more hours.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of hours she needs to start writing.

She needs to start writing 2 hours before the deadline.
