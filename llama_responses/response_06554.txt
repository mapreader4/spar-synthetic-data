Let's break down the information given:

* Michelle uses 5 blue beads.
* She uses 2 times as many red beads as blue beads, so she uses 2 x 5 = 10 red beads.
* She uses the same number of white beads as the blue and red beads combined, so she uses 5 + 10 = 15 white beads.
* The total number of beads used is 40, and the number of blue, red, and white beads is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30. This means the number of silver beads is 40 - 30 = 10.

Answer: 10
