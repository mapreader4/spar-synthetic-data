Let's break it down step by step.

The main meal costs $12.0. There are 3 people, so the cost for the main meal is 3 x $12.0 = $36.00. The 2 appetizers cost $6.00 each, so the total cost for the appetizers is 2 x $6.00 = $12.00. The tip is 20% of the total cost, which is $36.00, so the tip is $7.20. The extra $5.00 to make it a rush order is added to the total cost. So, the total cost is $36.00 + $12.00 + $7.20 + $5.00 = $55.20.

Answer: 55.20
