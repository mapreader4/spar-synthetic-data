Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total cost of the honey Penny has purchased.

Penny has paid $240, and the price of the honey is $5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of honey Penny has bought, we need to divide the total cost by the price per pound.

$240 รท $5 = 48

Penny has bought 48 pounds of honey.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of honey Penny's purchase exceeds the minimum spend of $40.

48 pounds - 40 pounds = 8 pounds

Penny's purchase exceeds the minimum spend by 8 pounds.

Answer: 8
