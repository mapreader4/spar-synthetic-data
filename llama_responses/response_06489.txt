Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. The squirrel had 210 acorns initially and divided it into thirds, so it had 210 รท 3 = 70 acorns for each month.

2. It then took some acorns from each third, leaving 60 acorns for each month. This means it took 70 - 60 = 10 acorns from each third.

3. Since there are three months, it took a total of 10 x 3 = 30 acorns.

4. The squirrel combined the 30 acorns it took from each month, so it has a total of 30 acorns to eat at the beginning of spring.

Answer: 30
