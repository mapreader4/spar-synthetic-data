Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, Dolly wants to ride the Ferris wheel twice. This will require 2 tickets, which are 2 x 2 = 4 tickets.

Next, Dolly wants to ride the roller coaster three times. This will require 3 tickets, which are 3 x 5 = 15 tickets.

Finally, Dolly wants to ride the log ride seven times. This will require 7 tickets, which are 7 x 1 = 7 tickets.

In total, Dolly will need 4 + 15 + 7 = 26 tickets.

Dolly has 20 tickets, and she needs 26 tickets. Therefore, Dolly will need to buy 26 - 20 = 6 more tickets.
