Let's break down the information given. We know that the total height of all 5 siblings is 330 inches, and 2 of them are 66 inches tall. So, the total height of these 2 siblings is 2 x 66 = 132 inches. The remaining 3 siblings are 330 - 132 = 198 inches tall. We know that one of these 3 siblings is 60 inches tall. So, the other 2 siblings are 198 - 60 = 138 inches tall. Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling. So, the height of Eliza is 138 - 2 = 136 inches. 

Answer: 136
