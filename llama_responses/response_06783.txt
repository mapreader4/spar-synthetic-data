Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of friends Lyle has is x.

Lyle has $2.50 and he wants to spend all of it on sandwiches and juice packs for himself and his friends.

A sandwich costs $0.30, and a pack of juice costs $0.2. So, one sandwich and one pack of juice will cost $0.30 + $0.2 = $0.50. So, one sandwich and one pack of juice will cost $0.50.

Since Lyle has $2.50, and he wants to spend all of it, he can buy:

$2.50 / $0.50 = 5

So, Lyle can buy 5 sandwiches and packs of juice.
