Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that they sold mushrooms for a total of $58 on the first day. Since the price per mushroom is $2, we can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 2y = 58

where x is the number of mushrooms they picked on the first day and y is the number of mushrooms they picked on the second day.

We know that y is 12, since we're given that information. So, we can substitute 12 for y in the equation:

2x + 2(12) = 58

Now, we can solve for x:

2x + 24 = 58

Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to get:

2x = 34

Divide both sides by 2 to get:

x = 17

So, they picked 17 mushrooms on the first day.

On the second day, they picked 12 mushrooms, so the total number of mushrooms picked on the second and third days is 12 + 2(12) = 24.

The total number of mushrooms they picked is the sum of the mushrooms picked on the first, second, and third days:

17 + 24 = 41

Answer: 41
