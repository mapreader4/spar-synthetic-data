Let's break this down step by step.

Natalie's sister had 8 small diaries initially. She bought double the number of diaries she had, so that means she bought 8 x 2 = 16 diaries. Then, she lost 1/4 of the diaries she had. 1/4 of 16 is 16/4 = 4. So, she lost 4 diaries. So, she had 16 - 4 = 12 diaries left. So, Natalie's sister has 12 diaries now.
