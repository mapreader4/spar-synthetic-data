Let's break down the information given:

* First class seats can seat 10 people.
* Business class and first class together can seat the same number of people as economy class, which is 50.
* Economy class is half full, which means there are 25 people in economy class.
* Economy class and business class together can seat 50 people, so business class and first class together can seat 25 people.

Since business class and first class together can seat 25 people, and 3 people are in first class, the number of people in business class is 25 - 3 = 22.

Answer: 22
