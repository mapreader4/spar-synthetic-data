Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the second day, 34 cm of rain fell. On the third day, 12 cm less than the second day fell, so on the third day, 34 - 12 = 22 cm of rain fell.

The total rainfall for the first three days is:
26 + 34 + 22 = 82 cm

The average rainfall for the first three days is 140 cm, so the difference between the actual rainfall and the average rainfall is:
140 - 82 = 58 cm

Answer: 58
