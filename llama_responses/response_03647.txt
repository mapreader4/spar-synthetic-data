Let's break this problem down step by step.

The cost of the order is $7.50. Carla has a coupon for $2.50, so she will get a discount of $2.50 from the original price. So, the new price will be $7.50 - $2.50 = $4.50.

Now, she gets an additional 20% discount for being a senior citizen. To find 20% of $4.50, we multiply $4.50 by 0.20 to get $0.90. So, the total discount is $4.50 - $0.90 = $3.60.

So, Carla pays $3.60 for her order.
