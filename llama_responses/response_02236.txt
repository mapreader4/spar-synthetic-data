Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us.

* Evie collects her favorite 10 shells each day.
* At the end of 6 days, she gives 2 shells to her brother.

Let's calculate the total number of shells Evie collects in 6 days:

10 shells per day * 6 days = 60 shells

Now, we need to subtract the 2 shells she gives to her brother.

60 shells - 2 shells = 58 shells

So, Evie has 58 shells left.

Answer: 58
