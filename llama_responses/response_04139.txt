Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Eric has 4 ninja throwing stars.
2. Chad has twice as many ninja throwing stars as Eric, which is 4 x 2 = 8 ninja throwing stars.
3. Jeff bought 2 ninja stars from Chad, so now he has 2 + 6 = 8 ninja throwing stars.
4. To find the total number of ninja throwing stars Eric and Jeff have, we add the number of ninja throwing stars they have, which is 4 + 8 = 12.

Answer: 12
