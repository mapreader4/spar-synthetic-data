Let's break this down step by step.

We know that the bar of chocolate has 60 pieces.

1. Michael takes half of the bar, which is 60 / 2 = 30 pieces.
2. Paige takes half of the remainder, which is 30 / 2 = 15 pieces.
3. Mandy is left with the remainder, which is 60 - 30 - 15 = 15 pieces.

So, Mandy gets 15 pieces of chocolate.

Answer: 15
