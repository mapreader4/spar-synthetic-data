Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that Arwen was able to get 20 tulips, and Elrond was able to get twice as many tulips as Arwen did. Since Arwen got 20 tulips, Elrond got 20 x 2 = 40 tulips.

To find the total number of tulips they were able to get, we need to add the number of tulips Arwen got to the number of tulips Elrond got. So, the total number of tulips they were able to get is:

20 + 40 = 60

Answer: 60
