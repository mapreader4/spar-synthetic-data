Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Gina collected 2 bags of litter, and the rest of the neighborhood collected 82 times as much as Gina did. This means that the total amount of litter collected is 2 + 82 = 84 bags.

Each bag of litter weighs 4 pounds. So, the total weight of the litter collected is 84 x 4 = 336 pounds.

Answer: 336
