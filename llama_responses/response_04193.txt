Let's break this down step by step:

Hayden irons his shirt for 5 minutes a day, and he does this 5 days a week. 5 * 5 = 25 minutes.

He also irons his pants for 3 minutes a day, and he does this 5 days a week. 3 * 5 = 15 minutes.

In total, he irons his clothes for 25 + 15 = 40 minutes a week. 

Now, we want to find the total time he irons over 4 weeks. 4 * 40 = 160 minutes.
