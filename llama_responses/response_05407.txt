Let's break down the problem step by step.

Day 1: Jill studies for 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Day 2: Jill doubles the amount of time she studied the previous day, so she studies 2 * 120 = 240 minutes.

Day 3: Jill studies one hour less than the previous day, so she studies 240 - 60 = 180 minutes.

To find the total amount of time Jill studies, we add the minutes from each day:

120 + 240 + 180 = 540

Answer: 540
