Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of 4-pound rocks Jack needs is x.

We know that Jack weighs 60 pounds and Anna weighs 40 pounds. So, if they want to be equal in weight, their total weight should be the same. 

Let's set up an equation to represent this.

60 + 4x = 40 + 4x

We can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation to get:

60 + 4x - 40 = 4x

We can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation to get:

20 = 4x

We can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get:

20 / 4 = x

x = 5

So, Jack needs 5 four-pound rocks to make their weights equal.
