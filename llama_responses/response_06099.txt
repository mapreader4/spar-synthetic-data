Let's start by letting Rene's sister have x dolls. Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, so Rene has 3x dolls. Their grandmother has 50 dolls. We know that their sister has two more dolls than their grandmother, so she has 50 + 2 = 52 dolls. Rene has 3x dolls, so she has 3 * 52 = 156 dolls. To find the total number of dolls, we add Rene's dolls and her sister's dolls together, so we have 156 + 52 = 208 dolls. Answer: 208.
