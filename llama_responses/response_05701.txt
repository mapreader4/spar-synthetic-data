Let's break this problem down step by step.

Alvin is 30 years old. Simon is 5 years away from being 1/2 the age of Alvin. So, we need to find 1/2 of Alvin's age.

To find 1/2 of Alvin's age, we multiply Alvin's age by 2, which is 2, and divide the result by 1, which is 30 * 2 / 1 = 60.

Since Simon is 5 years away from being this result, we subtract 5 from 60 to get Simon's age. So, Simon is 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Answer: 55
