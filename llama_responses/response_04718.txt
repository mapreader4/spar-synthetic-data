Let's break this down step by step:

1. James writes 5 pages per hour.  So, the time it takes him to write 1 page is 1/5 hours.

2. Since he writes from 1 PM to 4 PM, that is a total of 3 hours.  So, he can write 3 * 5 = 15 pages.

3. 735 pages / 15 pages per hour = 49 hours.

4. The total time it takes James to finish his book is 49 hours.

5. 49 hours / 1 hour = 49.

Answer: 49
