Let's start by calculating the total number of books sold across the three months.

January: 15 books
February: 16 books
Total books sold so far: 15 + 16 = 31 books

The average number of books sold per month is 16, so to find the number of books sold in March, we can set up the equation:

(15 + 16 + x) / 3 = 16

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

3 * 16 = 3 * (15 + 16 + x)

Now, we can subtract 3 * 15 and 3 * 16 from both sides of the equation:

3 * 16 = 48 - 45 = 3

So, the number of books sold in March is 3.
