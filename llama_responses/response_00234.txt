Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Mark pays the cashier $7.00 with a $7.00 bill. So, the cashier will give Mark the change.

Step 2: The change is $0.00, since the bill was paid in full.

Step 3: The cashier only has a 1 quarter and a 1 dime, which is $0.25. Since the change is $0.00, the cashier does not have enough coins to give Mark as change.

Step 4: Mark will receive 0 quarters and 0 dimes.
