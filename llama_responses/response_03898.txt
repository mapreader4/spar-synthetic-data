Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. She sold 24 slices of pizza. Each slice costs $3, so the total cost of the slices is 24 x $3 = $72.
2. She also sold 3 whole pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost of the pizzas is 3 x $15 = $45.
3. To find the total amount of money she earned, we need to add the cost of the slices and the cost of the pizzas. So, the total amount is 72 + 45 = $117.

Answer: 117
