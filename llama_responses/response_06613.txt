Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of hens that lay eggs. We know that 20 hens do not lay eggs, so those 20 hens are not egg-laying hens. The rest of the hens, which are 325 - 20 = 305, do lay eggs.

So, the number of egg-laying hens is 305.

Answer: 305
