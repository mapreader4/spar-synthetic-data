Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total amount of dog food the second dog eats in a day. Since the second dog eats twice as much as the first dog, and the first dog eats 1.5 cups, the second dog eats 1.5 * 2 = 3 cups.

Next, the third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog. So, the third dog eats 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 cups.

Now, to find the total amount of dog food Hannah should prepare, we add the cups eaten by each dog: 1.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 10 cups.

Answer: 10
