Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by adding the number of spelling badges that Hermione and Luna have together. Hermione has 14 and Luna has 17, so we add those numbers together to get 14 + 17 = 31.

Since Celestia has a total of 83 spelling badges, and Hermione and Luna have 31, we can subtract 31 from 83 to find the number of spelling badges Celestia has. 

83 - 31 = 52.

Answer: 52
