Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Jason has three times as many toys as John. Let's call the number of toys John has "x".

We know that John has 6 more toys than Rachel, and Rachel has 1 toy. So, Rachel has x - 1 toys. We know that Jason has 3x toys. So, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x = 3x

We can add 6 to both sides of the equation to get:

x + 6 = 3x + 6

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 3x - 6 + 6

This simplifies to:

x = 9

So, Jason has 9 toys.
