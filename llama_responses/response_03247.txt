Let's break this down step by step:

1. James takes 4 weeks to heal enough to get a skin graft.
2. After the skin graft, it takes him 50% longer to heal from the skin graft.

To find the time it takes to heal from the skin graft, we can multiply the initial healing time by 1.5 (50% longer). 4 weeks * 1.5 = 6 weeks.

So, James took 4 weeks to heal enough to get a skin graft, and 6 weeks to heal from the skin graft. Therefore, the total time it took for James to recover from everything is:

Answer: 10 weeks
