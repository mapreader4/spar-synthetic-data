To find the volume of the birdhouse Sara built, we need to multiply the length, width, and height. The volume of Sara's birdhouse is 1 foot * 2 feet * 2 feet = 4 cubic feet.

To find the volume of the birdhouse Jake built, we need to convert the measurements to feet and then multiply them together. 16 inches is equal to 1 foot, 20 inches is equal to 1.67 feet, and 18 inches is equal to 1.5 feet. So, the volume of Jake's birdhouse is 1 foot * 1.67 feet * 1.5 feet = 1.995 cubic feet.

The difference in volume is the difference between the two volumes, which is 1.995 - 4 = -2.005 cubic feet. The answer is:
