Let's start by identifying the given information.

The information provided is: "Ariel has 45 fish. 2/3 are male."

The given information is about the ratio of male fish, not the total number of fish. So, the total number of fish is 45. The ratio of male fish is 2/3 of the total fish, which means that the total number of female fish is:

2/3 of 45 = 2/3 * 45 = 30

So, Ariel has 30 female fish.
