Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of small, medium, and large ceiling lights. We know that there are 12 medium ceiling lights. Since my wife saw twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights, that means there are 12 * 2 = 24 large ceiling lights. And there are 10 more small lights than medium lights, so there are 12 + 10 = 22 small lights.

Now, let's find the total number of bulbs needed. The small ones require 1 bulb each, so we need 22 small lights * 1 = 22 bulbs. The medium ones require 2 bulbs each, so we need 12 medium lights * 2 = 24 bulbs. And the large ones need 3 bulbs each, so we need 24 large lights * 3 = 72 bulbs.

In total, we need 22 + 24 + 72 = 118 bulbs. Answer: 118.
