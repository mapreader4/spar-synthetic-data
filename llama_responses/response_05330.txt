Let's break it down step by step.

Steve makes 40000$ as a teacher.  He loses 20 percent to taxes.  20 percent of 40000 is 8000$.  So, Steve loses 8000$.  He loses 10 percent to healthcare, which is 4000$.  So, he loses 8000 + 4000 = 12000$.  He loses 800$ to local union dues.  So, he loses 800.  In total, Steve loses 8000 + 4000 + 800 = 12000 + 800 = 120800.  He takes 40000 - 120800 = 27920$.  Steve takes home 27920$.
