Let's break down Kyle's monthly expenses into categories:

1. Rent: $1250
2. Utilities: $150
3. Retirement & savings accounts: $400
4. Groceries/eating out: $300
5. Insurance: $200
6. Miscellaneous expenses: $200

Total monthly expenses: $1250 + $150 + $400 + $300 + $200 + $200 = $1900

Kyle makes $3200 every month, so to find out how much is left for gas and maintenance, we need to subtract his total expenses from his monthly income:

$3200 - $1900 = $1300

So, Kyle has $1300 left for gas and maintenance.
