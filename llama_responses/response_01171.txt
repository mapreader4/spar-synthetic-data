Let's start by determining the number of trophies Jack will have in three years. Michael has 30 trophies now, and the number of his trophies increases by 100 in three years, so he will have 130 trophies in three years.

Now, we can determine the total number of trophies they'll have together. Jack will have 10 times as many trophies as Michael will have in three years. So, Jack will have 10 * 130 = 1300 trophies. Therefore, the total number of trophies they'll have altogether is 1300 + 130 = 1430.

Answer: 1430
