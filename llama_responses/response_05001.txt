Let's break down the problem step by step.

Gretchen sold 24 drawings on Saturday, which is 24 x $20.00 = $480.00.

Gretchen also sold 16 drawings on Sunday, which is 16 x $20.00 = $320.00.

To find the total amount of money she made, we add the money from Saturday and Sunday together. $480.00 + $320.00 = $800.00.

Answer: $800.00
