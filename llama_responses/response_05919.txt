Let's break it down step by step.

Janet spends 8 minutes looking for her keys, and another 3 minutes complaining after she finds them. So, the total time she spends each day is 8 + 3 = 11 minutes.

If she does this every day, we multiply this by 7 (the number of days in a week) to get the total time she spends in a week: 11 * 7 = 77 minutes.

So, Janet will save 77 minutes every week.
