Let's break down the problem step by step.

John gave his fiancee a $4000 ring on their engagement day.

John gave his fiancee a $2000 car on their wedding day.

John gave his fiancee a diamond bracelet twice as expensive as the ring he gave her during the engagement. Let's call the value of the ring given during the engagement "x".

So, the value of the ring is x.

The value of the bracelet is 2x.

So, the total value of the presents John gave to his fiancee is:

$4000 (ring) + $2000 (car) + 2x (bracelet)

We know that x is twice the value of the ring. So, we can substitute x with 4000 to get:

2x = 4000

So, x is 2000.

Now, we can substitute x with 2000:

2(2000) = 4000

The total value of the presents John gave to his fiancee is:

$4000 (ring) + $2000 (car) + 2(2000) (bracelet)

The answer is:

Answer: 8000
