Let's start by using the information given to set up an equation.

Let x be Jayson's mom's age when Jayson was born.

Jayson's dad is 4 times Jayson's age, so we can set up the equation 4x = Jayson's dad's age.

We know Jayson's dad's age is 10. So, we can substitute 10 for x in the equation.

4x = 10

Now, we can solve for x.

x = 10 / 4

x = 2.5

Jayson's mom is 2 years younger than his dad. So, we can find Jayson's mom's age by adding 2 to 2.5.

2.5 + 2 = 4.5

Jayson's mom was 4.5 years old when Jayson was born.
