Let's break this problem down step by step.

The first hibiscus plant has 2 flowers.
The second hibiscus plant has twice as many flowers as the first hibiscus plant, which is 2 * 2 = 4 flowers.
The third hibiscus plant has four times as many flowers as the second hibiscus plant, which is 4 * 4 = 16 flowers.

To find the total number of blossoms, we add the number of flowers from each plant:

2 + 4 + 16 = 22

Answer: 22
