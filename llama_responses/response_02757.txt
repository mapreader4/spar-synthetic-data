Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Kyro owes Fernanda an amount, and Aryan owes Fernanda twice that amount. Let's call the amount Kyro owes Fernanda "x". Then, Aryan owes Fernanda 2x.

We also know that Kyro pays 80% of her debt, which is 0.8x. Aryan pays 60% of her debt, which is 0.6(2x) = 1.2x.

The total amount paid to Fernanda is the sum of the amounts paid by Kyro and Aryan: 0.8x + 1.2x = 2.0x.

We know that the total amount owed to Fernanda is $1200, which is the sum of the amounts owed by Kyro and Aryan: x + 2x = 3x = 1200.

Now, we can find the amount Kyro owes Fernanda: x = 1200/3 = 400.

So, the amount Aryan owes Fernanda is 2x = 2(400) = 800.

Kyro pays 0.8(400) = 320, and Aryan pays 0.6(800) = 480.

The total amount paid to Fernanda is 320 + 480 = 800.

Adding this to the $300 she already had in her savings account, Fernanda now has a total of:

300 + 800 = 1100

Answer: 1100
