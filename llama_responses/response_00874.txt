Let's break this down step by step.

Winston has 14 quarters. A quarter is 25 cents, so 14 quarters is 14 x 25 cents. 14 x 25 cents is 350 cents.

He then spends half a dollar on candy. A half dollar is 50 cents, so he spends 50 cents on candy.

To find the number of cents Winston has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had. 350 cents - 50 cents is 300 cents.

Answer: 300
