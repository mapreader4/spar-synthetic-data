Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The cost of the large pizza is $10.00, which is the base cost.

2. The first topping, pepperoni, costs $2.00, so we add that to the base cost: $10.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

3. The next 2 toppings, sausage and ham, each cost $1.00, so we add that to the total cost: $12.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $14.00.

4. The rest of the toppings, olives, mushrooms, bell peppers, and pineapple, cost $0.50 each, and there are 4 of them, so we add that to the total cost: $14.00 + $0.50 x 4 = $14.00 + $2.00 = $16.00.

5. The total cost of the pizza is $16.00.

6. The pizza is cut into 8 slices, so to find the cost per slice, we divide the total cost by the number of slices: $16.00 รท 8 = $2.00.
