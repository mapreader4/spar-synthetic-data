Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of fish in the first tank. There are 20 fish in the first tank.

The other two tanks have twice as many fish as the first tank. So, if the first tank has 20 fish, the other two tanks have 2 * 20 = 40 fish each.

To find the total number of fish, we add the number of fish from each tank:

20 (from the first tank) + 40 (from the second tank) + 40 (from the third tank) = 100

Answer: 100
