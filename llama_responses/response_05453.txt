Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. Bryan walks 5 minutes to the bus station. This is a total of 5 minutes.

2. Then, he rides the bus for 20 minutes. This is a total of 20 minutes.

3. Then, he walks 5 minutes from the bus station to his job. This is a total of 5 minutes.

So, in total, Bryan spends 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes per day on his daily commute.

To find the number of hours Bryan spends per year, we need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

30 minutes is 0.5 hours.

Since Bryan works every day, we multiply the daily time by 7 (days in a week):

0.5 hours * 7 = 3.5 hours

So, Bryan spends 3.5 hours per year on his daily commute to and from work.
