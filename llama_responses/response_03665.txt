Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of the candy bars, chocolate, and juice:

* Candy bars: 3 candy bars x ¢25 = ¢75
* Chocolate: 2 pieces x ¢75 = ¢150
* Juice: 1 pack x ¢50 = ¢50

The total cost is: ¢75 + ¢150 + ¢50 = ¢275

Now, we need to find how many quarters are needed to pay for this total cost.

Since each quarter is worth ¢25, we can divide the total cost by 25:

¢275 ÷ 25 = 11

Answer: 11
