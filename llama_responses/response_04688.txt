Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's say the price of the coat is x.

The problem states that the shirt is one-third the price of the coat. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

x/3 = price of the shirt

We know that the total cost of the shirt and the coat is $600. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

x + x/3 = 600

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 3 to get:

3x = 1800

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = 1800 / 3

x = 600

Answer: 600
