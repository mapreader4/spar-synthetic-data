Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Jorge is 24 years younger than Simon.

Let's say Simon's current age is x.

Then, Jorge's age is x - 24.

In 2005, Jorge is 16 years old, so Jorge's age in 2005 is 16.

So, Simon's age in 2005 is x - 24 = 16.

We can now set up an equation: x - 24 = 16.

Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 16 + 24.

Answer: 40.
