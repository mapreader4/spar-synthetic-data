Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of apples that they need to order for a month. We know that Chandler can eat 23 apples per week, and Lucy can eat 19 apples per week. So, in a month, they will eat 23 * 4 = 92 apples per month.

So, they will need to order 92 apples for a month.

Answer: 92
