Let's break it down step by step.

There are 10 bags, and each bag has 30 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is 10 x 30 = 300.

We need to subtract the 30 oranges that will be kept for making orange juice. So, we subtract 30 from 300, which gives us 300 - 30 = 270.

The remaining oranges will be sold. So, the number of oranges that will be sold is 270.

Answer: 270
