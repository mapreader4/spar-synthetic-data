Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Jason pepper-sprays some raccoons and 6 times as many squirrels. This means that the number of raccoons is 6 times the number of squirrels.

Let's say the number of squirrels is x. Then, the number of raccoons is 6x. We are given that the total number of animals is 84.

We can set up an equation to represent this: 6x + x = 84.

Now, we can solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to get: x = 84 - 6 = x.

x = 78.

Answer: 78
