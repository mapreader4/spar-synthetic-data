Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of students who like green: half of the class answered green, which is 15 students. 

Next, let's identify the number of students who like pink, which is one-third of the class, which is 10 students.

Finally, let's find the number of students who like yellow, which is the remaining students, which is 5.

To find the number of students who like yellow, we can subtract the number of students who like green and pink from the total number of students, which is 30. 

So, the number of students who like yellow is 30 - 15 - 10 = 5.

Answer: 5
