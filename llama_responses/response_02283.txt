Let's count the number of people in the orchestra step by step.

1. In the brass section, there are:
	* 4 people playing trombone
	* 2 people playing trumpet
	* 1 person playing French horn
	Total: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 people in the brass section
2. In the strings section, there are:
	* 3 violinists
	* 1 cellist
	* 1 contrabassist
	Total: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 people in the strings section
3. In the woodwinds section, there are:
	* 3 people playing clarinets (trio)
	* 4 people playing flutes (quartet)
	Total: 3 + 4 = 7 people in the woodwinds section
4. Sebastian, the drummer, is also part of the orchestra.
5. The maestro, who conducts the orchestra, is also counted.

Adding up the numbers, we get:
	* 7 people in the brass section
	* 5 people in the strings section
	* 7 people in the woodwinds section
	* 1 drummer (Sebastian)
	* 1 maestro
	Total: 7 + 5 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 21 people in the orchestra
