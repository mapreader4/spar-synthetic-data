Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total length of the race, which is 74.5 kilometers.

The first part of the race is 15.5 kilometers long. 

The second and third parts are each 21.5 kilometers long.

We know that the total length of the race is 74.5 kilometers, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

15.5 + 21.5 + x = 74.5

We are trying to find the length of the last part of the race, which is represented by the variable 'x'.

To solve for x, we can subtract the lengths of the first two parts from the total length of the race:

74.5 - 15.5 - 21.5 = x

Now, we can simplify the equation:

74.5 - 37 = x

x = 37

Answer: 37
