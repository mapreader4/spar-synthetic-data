Let's start by breaking down the information given in the problem.

There are 28 garden gnomes, and three-fourths of them have red hats. This means that 28 * 3/4 = 21 gnomes have red hats. This leaves 28 - 21 = 7 gnomes with blue hats.

We are asked to find out how many gnomes with red hats have small noses. However, we are not given this information. We are given that half the gnomes have big noses. This information does not help us solve the problem.

Let's summarize the information we have so far: 21 gnomes have red hats, and we know that 6 gnomes with blue hats have big noses. We are not given the information about the number of gnomes with small noses. We can't conclude that the number of gnomes with red hats and small noses is equal to the number of gnomes with blue hats and big noses.

So, we can't answer the question. The information given is not enough to solve the problem.
