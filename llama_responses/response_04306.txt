Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of deer with 8 antlers. 10% of the deer have 8 antlers, so to find the number of deer with 8 antlers, we multiply 10% by the total number of deer.

The total number of deer is 920. To find 10% of this number, we multiply 10 by 920, which gives us:

10 x 920 = 9200

Now, we are looking for a quarter of this number that also have albino fur. A quarter of 9200 is:

9200 / 4 = 2300

Now, we are looking for a subset of 2300 deer that also have 8 antlers. Since the problem states that 10% of the deer have 8 antlers, we can conclude that the number of albino 8-antlered deer is equal to the number of deer with 8 antlers. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 230
