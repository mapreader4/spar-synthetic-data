Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Lisa took 10 photos of animals.
* She took 3 times as many photos of flowers as animals.
* She took 10 fewer photos of flowers than animals.
* She took 15 fewer photos last weekend.

We can start by finding the number of photos of flowers:

* If she took 10 photos of animals and took 3 times as many photos of flowers, then she took 10 x 3 = 30 photos of flowers.
* Since she took 10 fewer photos of flowers than animals, then she took 30 - 10 = 20 photos of flowers.
* If she took 15 fewer photos last weekend, then she took 15 + 20 = 35 photos.

So, the total number of photos Lisa took last weekend is:

Answer: 35
