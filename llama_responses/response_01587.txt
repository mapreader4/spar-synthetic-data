Let's break down the given information step by step:

Let's start by identifying the number of smoking students in the class: 40% of 300 students.

40% of 300 students = 0.4 x 300 = 120 students

Now, we are given that 70% of these 120 smoking students are hospitalized from smoking-related complications.

70% of 120 students = 0.7 x 120 = 84 students

So, the number of smoking students who have not been hospitalized from smoking-related complications is the difference between the total number of smoking students and the number of hospitalized students.

Total smoking students - Number of hospitalized students = 120 - 84 = 36

Answer: 36
