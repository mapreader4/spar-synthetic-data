Let's break this down step by step.

1. The DVD cost 5 dollars.
2. The friend, Steve, paid twice the cost of the DVD, which is 2 * 5 = 10.
3. The shipping cost 80% of the price, which is 0.8 * 10 = 8.
4. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the DVD and the shipping cost, which is 10 + 8 = 18.

Answer: 18
