Let's break down the information into smaller parts:

* Meghan scored 20 marks less than Jose.
* Jose scored 40 more marks than Alisson.
* The total score of the three in the test is the sum of the scores of Meghan, Jose, and Alisson.

Let's denote Meghan's score as M, Jose's score as J, and Alisson's score as A. We know that:

M = J - 20, and J = A + 40

We can solve for M:

M = J - 20
M = J - 20
M = J - 20 + 40
M = J + 20
M = J + 20
M = J + 20

Now, we know that M = 20. We can find the total score of the three:

M + J + A = 20 + J + A
20 + J + A = 20 + 40 + A

The total score of the three in the test is 60 + A.
