Let's break down the problem step by step.

Emerson rowed for 6 miles initially, so he covered 6 miles.

Then, he continued for 15 miles, so he covered another 15 miles.

Finally, he covered the remaining 18 miles.

So, the total distance covered by Emerson is 6 + 15 + 18 = 39.

Answer: 39
