Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of nickels Val has initially is x.
2. According to the problem, Val has three times as many dimes as nickels, so the number of dimes she has is 3x.
3. She finds twice as many nickels as she has in her older brother's treasure box. Since she has x nickels, she finds 2x nickels, which is 2x.
4. So, the total number of nickels she has now is x + 2x = 3x.
5. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so the total value of the nickels she has is 0.05(3x) = 0.15x.
6. She had 20 nickels initially, which is 0.05(20) = $1.00. After finding the new nickels, she has 0.15x = 0.15(3x) = 0.45x.
7. The total value of the money she has is the sum of the value of the initial nickels and the value of the new nickels, which is 1.00 + 0.45x.

Answer: $1.45
