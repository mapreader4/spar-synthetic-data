Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Ken wants to buy 2 pounds of steak at a price of $7 per pound. So, the total cost of the steak will be 2 x $7 = $14.
2. Ken pays with a $20 bill.
3. He will get back the change from the $20 bill by subtracting the cost of the steak from the $20 bill.

$20 - $14 = $6
