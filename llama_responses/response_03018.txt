Kara drinks 4 ounces of water each time she takes her medication. She takes her medication three times a day. So, in the first week, she drank 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water. In the second week, she forgot to take it twice, so she only took it one time that day. So, in the second week, she took 4 ounces. In total, she drank 12 + 4 = 16 ounces.
