Let's break down Carla's trip step by step:

1. She needs to drive 8 miles to the grocery store.
2. Then, she needs to drive 6 miles to pick up her kids from school.
3. After that, she needs to drive 12 miles to drop her kids off at soccer practice.
4. Finally, she needs to drive twice the distance from the school to soccer practice to get everyone home again. The distance from the school to soccer practice is 12 miles, so twice that distance is 12 x 2 = 24 miles.

Now, let's add up the total distance Carla needs to drive:

8 miles + 6 miles + 12 miles + 24 miles = 50 miles

Since Carla's car gets 25 miles per gallon, she will need:

50 miles / 25 miles/gallon = 2 gallons of gas

Gas costs $2.50 per gallon, so Carla will need to spend:

2 gallons x $2.50/gallon = $5.00
