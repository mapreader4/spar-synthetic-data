Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of dogs Ed has: 2 dogs.

Next, let's identify the number of cats Ed has: 3 cats.

Since Ed has twice as many fish as cats and dogs combined, we know that the number of fish is 2 * (3 + 2) = 6.

Now, to find the total number of pets Ed has, we add the number of dogs, cats, and fish together:

2 + 3 + 6 = 11

Answer: 11
