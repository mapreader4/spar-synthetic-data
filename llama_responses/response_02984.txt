Let's start by identifying the number of bottles that will be placed in a crate. Since Joshua packs 12 bottles in each crate, the number of bottles that will be placed in a crate is 12.

Let's calculate the total number of bottles that will be placed in crates by multiplying the number of crates by the number of bottles per crate:

12 bottles/crate * 10 crates = 12 * 10 = 120

So, the number of bottles that will not be placed in a crate is 130 - 120 = 10.
