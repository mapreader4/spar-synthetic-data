Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total amount of cones sold is $100. That's how much money Dan made. Each cone costs $2, so to find out how many cones he sold, we can divide 100 by 2.

100 / 2 = 50

So, Dan sold 50 cones. Since every 6th customer gets a free cone, he gave away 50 / 6 = 8 cones.

Answer: 8
