Let's start by calculating the total amount of money the family has. The number of pennies is 123, the number of nickels is 85, the number of dimes is 35, and the number of quarters is unknown. The total amount of money is 123 + 85 + 35 = 243. Since each double scoop costs $3, the total cost of the double scoop is 2 x 3 = 6. The amount of money left is 243 - 6 = 237. The amount of quarters is 237 divided by 0.25, which is 237 / 0.25 = 948. The answer is 948.
