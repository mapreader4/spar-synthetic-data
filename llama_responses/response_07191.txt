Let's break this problem down step by step.

On Monday, Sally picks 30 seashells. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells, so she picks 15 seashells.

She can sell each seashell for $1.20, so she can sell 30 seashells for 30 * 1.20 = 36.00. She can sell 15 seashells for 15 * 1.20 = 18.00.

In total, she can make 36.00 + 18.00 = 54.00.

Answer: 54
