Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Let's assume that Kevin has x toads in his shoebox.
2. Each toad is fed 3 worms.
3. It takes 15 minutes to find each worm. 15 minutes is equivalent to 0.25 hours.
4. It takes 6 hours to find enough worms to feed all of his toads. 6 hours is equivalent to 24 times 0.25 hours.
5. Since 24 times 0.25 is 6, it means that 24 worms are needed to feed all of his toads.
6. Since each toad is fed 3 worms, 24 worms are equivalent to 8 toads.
7. Kevin has 8 toads.

Answer: 8
