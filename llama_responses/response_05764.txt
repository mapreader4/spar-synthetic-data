Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The first lady walked twice as far as the second lady.
* The second lady walked 4 miles.

We can represent the first lady's distance as 2x, where x is the distance the second lady walked.

We know that 2x = 4, so x = 2.

So, the first lady walked 2(2) = 4 miles.

The combined distance the two ladies walked is the sum of the distance the first lady walked and the distance the second lady walked, which is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Answer: 8
