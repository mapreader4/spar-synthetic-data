Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what we know.

1. Mr. Salazar has 7 oranges.
2. He reserved 1/4 of the oranges for his friend, so we subtract 1/4 of 7, which is 7/4 = 1.75. So, he has 7 - 1.75 = 5.75 oranges left.
3. Yesterday, he sold 3/7 of the remaining oranges, so we need to find 3/7 of 5.75. To do this, we multiply 5.75 by 3/7, which is 5.75 * 3/7 = 2.625. So, he sold 2.625 oranges.
4. Today, he sees 4 rotten oranges. We need to subtract 4 from the remaining 5.75, which is 5.75 - 4 = 1.75. So, he has 1.75 oranges left to be sold today.

Answer: 1.75
