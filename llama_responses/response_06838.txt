Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of days John was on the first mission.

The first mission took 5 days. Then, he had to go on a second mission which took 3 days. To find the total number of days John was on missions, we add the number of days for the first mission to the number of days for the second mission.

5 + 3 = 8

Answer: 8
