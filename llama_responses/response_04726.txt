Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of books Matias sold on Tuesday.

Matias sold 7 books on Tuesday.

Next, he sold three times as many books on Wednesday. To find the number of books sold on Wednesday, we can multiply the number of books sold on Tuesday by 3.

7 x 3 = 21

So, Matias sold 21 books on Wednesday.

Now, let's find the total number of books sold during the three days.

The total number of books sold during the three days is the sum of the number of books sold on Tuesday and Wednesday.

7 + 21 = 28

Answer: 28
