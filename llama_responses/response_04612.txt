Let's break it down step by step.

1. Samantha buys a crate of 30 eggs for $5. So, she has 30 eggs.
2. She decides to sell each egg for 20 cents. So, the revenue she gets from selling each egg is 20 cents.
3. To find the total revenue she gets from selling all the eggs, we need to multiply the number of eggs by the price she sells each egg for. So, 30 eggs * 0.20 = 6 dollars.
4. She recovers her capital, which is $5. So, she recovers 5 dollars.
5. Now, she has 5 dollars left.

To find the number of eggs she will have left, we need to subtract the revenue she recovers from her capital from the number of eggs she has. 5 - 6 = -1.

So, Samantha will have -1 eggs left.
