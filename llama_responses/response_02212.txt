Let's break it down step by step.

The cost of the first half of the season is $1000 per episode.  Since there are 22 episodes in the season, the total cost of the first half is:

$1000 x 22 = $22,000

The second half of the season is 120% more expensive than the first half.  This means the cost of each episode in the second half is:

$1000 * (1 + 0.2) = $1200

The total cost of the second half is the cost of each episode multiplied by the number of episodes:

$1200 * 22 = $26,400

The total cost of the entire season is the sum of the cost of the first half and the second half:

$22,000 + $26,400 = $48,400

Answer: 48400
