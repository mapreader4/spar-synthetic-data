Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given, which is that John's father is 40 years old. Since John's father is 4 years older than John's mother, that means John's mother is 40 - 4 = 36 years old.

Now, since John is half the age of his father, that means John's age is half of his father's age. Half of 40 is 20. So, John's age is 20 years old.

The age difference between John and his mother is 36 - 20 = 16. So, the answer is:

Answer: 16
