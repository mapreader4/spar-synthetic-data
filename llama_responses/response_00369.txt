Let's break down Monika's expenses step by step.

Monika spent $250 at the mall. Then, she went to the movies and spent 3 times $24 each. That is a total of 3 x $24 = $72. Then, she bought 20 bags of beans at $1.25/bag. The cost of the beans is 20 x $1.25 = $25.

To find the total amount Monika spent, we add up all of her expenses:

$250 + $72 + $25 = $347

Answer: 347
