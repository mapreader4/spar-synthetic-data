Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the question. We know that Kilee is currently 20 years old.

We are asked to find the age of Cornelia in 10 years. To do this, we need to add 10 years to Kilee's current age.

Kilee's current age is 20 years. Adding 10 years to that gives us:

20 + 10 = 30

So, in 10 years, Kilee will be 30 years old. We are also told that Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee. So, we can set up an equation:

Cornelia's age = 3 * Kilee's age

We know that Kilee will be 30 years old in 10 years, so we can substitute 30 for Kilee's age in the equation:

Cornelia's age = 3 * 30

We can solve for Cornelia's age by multiplying 3 with 30:

Cornelia's age = 3 * 30 = 90

So, Cornelia will be 90 years old in 10 years.
