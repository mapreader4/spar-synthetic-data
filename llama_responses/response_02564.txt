Let's break it down step by step.

1. The cost of fixing the racecar is $20,000.
2. John gets a 20% discount, so the cost is 20% less than the original price. 20% of 20,000 is 20,000 * 0.2 = 4,000. So the cost is 20,000 - 4,000 = 16,000.
3. John wins the first race and keeps 90% of the money. 90% of 70,000 is 70,000 * 0.9 = 63,000.
4. So, the amount of money John made from the car is 63,000 - 16,000 = 47,000.

Answer: 47,000.
