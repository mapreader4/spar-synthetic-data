Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of school days in an academic year, which is 180.

Aliyah packs her lunch half the time, so she packs her lunch for 180/2 = 90 days.

Becky packs her lunch half as much as Aliyah. So, Becky packs her lunch half of 90 days, which is 45 days.

So, Becky packs her lunch for 45 days a year.

Answer: 45
