Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how much money Bea earned. Bea sold 10 glasses of lemonade at 25 cents each. So, Bea earned 10 x 25 cents, which is 250 cents.

Next, let's find out how much money Dawn earned. Dawn sold 8 glasses of lemonade at 28 cents each. So, Dawn earned 8 x 28 cents, which is 224 cents.

Now, to find out how much more money Bea earned than Dawn, we need to subtract the amount of money Dawn earned from the amount of money Bea earned. 250 cents (Bea's earnings) - 224 cents (Dawn's earnings) = 26 cents.

Answer: 26
