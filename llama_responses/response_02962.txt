Let's break down Hayden's earnings step by step.

First, let's calculate the gas reimbursement. Hayden put 17 gallons of gas at $3 per gallon, so the total gas reimbursement is:

17 gallons x $3 per gallon = $51

Next, let's calculate Hayden's hourly wage. He drove for 8 hours at $15 per hour, so the total hourly wage is:

8 hours x $15 per hour = $120

Then, let's calculate the additional payment for each ride. Hayden gave rides to three groups, so he gets:

3 groups x $5 per ride = $15

Additionally, Hayden got two good reviews, which earned him a $20 bonus each, so the total bonus is:

2 reviews x $20 per review = $40

Now, let's add up all of Hayden's earnings:

Gas reimbursement: $51
Hourly wage: $120
Additional ride payment: $15
Bonus: $40

Total earnings: $51 + $120 + $15 + $40 = $226

Answer: 226
