Let's start by identifying the cost of the items purchased by each girl:

Kristine buys one set of barrettes and one comb, which costs 3 + 1 = 4 dollars.

Crystal buys three sets of barrettes and one comb, which costs 3 x 3 + 1 = 10 dollars.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the items bought by each girl. So, we add the costs together: 4 + 10 = 14 dollars.

Answer: 14
