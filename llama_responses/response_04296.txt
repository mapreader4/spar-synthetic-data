Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of water James can hold in his bathtub. Since each cubic foot of water is 7.5 gallons, and the bathtub can hold 6 cubic feet of water, we can multiply 6 by 7.5 to get the total amount of gallons:

6 cubic feet * 7.5 gallons/cubic foot = 45 gallons

Since each gallon of water weighs 8 pounds, we can multiply 45 by 8 to get the total amount of pounds of water:

45 gallons * 8 pounds/gallon = 360 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much jello mix James needs. For every pound of water, he needs 1.5 tablespoons of jello mix, so we can multiply the total amount of pounds of water by 1.5:

360 pounds * 1.5 tablespoons/pound = 540 tablespoons

Since each tablespoon of jello mix costs $0.50, we can multiply the total amount of tablespoons by $0.50 to get the total cost:

540 tablespoons * $0.50/tablespoon = $270

Therefore, James spent $270 to fill his tub.

Answer: 270
