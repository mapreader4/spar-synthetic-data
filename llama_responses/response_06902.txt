To find the sum of Misty's and Glory's favorite numbers, I will first find Misty's favorite number. Since Misty's favorite number is 3 times smaller than Glory's favorite number, and Glory's favorite number is 450, I will set up an equation to solve for Misty's favorite number.

Let x be Misty's favorite number. Then, the equation would be:

x = 450 / 3

To solve for x, I will divide 450 by 3:

450 รท 3 = 150

So, Misty's favorite number is 150.

To find the sum of their favorite numbers, I will add Misty's favorite number (150) and Glory's favorite number (450):

150 + 450 = 600

Answer: 600
