Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total number of cows and sheep on the farm. The problem states that Mr. Reyansh has 40 cows and a sheep ranch with 10 times the number of cows, so we can multiply 40 by 10 to get the number of sheep. 40 * 10 = 400. So, there are a total of 440 animals (40 cows + 400 sheep) on the farm.

2. Now, we need to find the total amount of water each animal drinks in a day. The cows drink 80 liters of water each day, so we can multiply 40 by 80 to get the total amount of water the cows drink in a day. 40 * 80 = 3200 liters. The sheep drink 1/4 as much water as a cow does, so we can multiply 3200 by 1/4 to get the total amount of water the sheep drink in a day. 3200 / 4 = 800 liters.

3. Finally, we need to find the total amount of water Mr. Reyansh uses in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we can multiply the daily amount of water the animals drink by 7 to get the total amount of water used in a week. 3200 + 800 * 7 = 22400 liters.

Answer: 22400
