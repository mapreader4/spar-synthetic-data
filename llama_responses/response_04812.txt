Let's break this problem down step by step.

On Monday, the restaurant sells 40 dinners.

On Tuesday, it sells 40 more dinners than it did on Monday, so it sells 40 + 40 = 80 dinners on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, it sells half the amount of dinners it sold on Tuesday, which is 80 / 2 = 40 dinners.

On Thursday, it sells 3 more dinners than it did on Wednesday, which is 40 + 3 = 43 dinners.

To find the total number of dinners sold in those 4 days, I will add the number of dinners sold each day:

40 (Monday) + 80 (Tuesday) + 40 (Wednesday) + 43 (Thursday) = 203

Answer: 203
