Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mr. Smith himself is an adult, so he pays the full price of $30 for his buffet.
2. His wife is also an adult, so she also pays the full price of $30 for her buffet.
3. Mr. Smith's parents are senior citizens, so they get a 10% discount on their buffet. 10% of $30 is $3, so they pay $27 for their buffet.
4. Mr. Smith has 3 children, and they each pay the children's price of $15 for their buffet.
5. To find the total cost, we add up the cost for Mr. Smith and his wife, the cost for his parents with the discount, and the cost for the children: $30 + $30 + $27 + $15 + $15 = $117.
