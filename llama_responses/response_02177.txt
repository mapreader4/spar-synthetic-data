Let's break down the problem step by step.

Part 1: Toby pulls the loaded sled for 180 miles at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the time taken, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 180 miles / 10 miles/hour
Time = 18 hours

So, Toby takes 18 hours to pull the loaded sled for 180 miles.

Part 2: Toby pulls the unloaded sled for 120 miles at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Again, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 120 miles / 20 miles/hour
Time = 6 hours

So, Toby takes 6 hours to pull the unloaded sled for 120 miles.

Part 3: Toby pulls the loaded sled for 80 miles at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Again, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 80 miles / 10 miles/hour
Time = 8 hours

So, Toby takes 8 hours to pull the loaded sled for 80 miles.

Part 4: Toby pulls the unloaded sled for 140 miles at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Again, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 140 miles / 20 miles/hour
Time = 7 hours

So, Toby takes 7 hours to pull the unloaded sled for 140 miles.

Now, let's add up the time taken for each part of the journey:

18 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours + 7 hours = 39 hours

Answer: 39
