Let's break this down step by step!

Bob started with 50 bushels of corn. Terry took 8 bushels, so Bob has:

50 - 8 = 42 bushels left

Then, Jerry took 3 bushels, leaving Bob with:

42 - 3 = 39 bushels

Next, Bob gave 12 bushels to Linda, leaving him with:

39 - 12 = 27 bushels

Finally, Stacy took 21 ears of corn (not bushels, but ears!), which is equivalent to 21 / 14 = 1.5 bushels (since each bushel contains 14 ears). So, Bob gave away 1.5 bushels to Stacy, leaving him with:

27 - 1.5 = 25.5 bushels

To convert this back to ears of corn, we multiply the remaining bushels by 14:

25.5 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 357 ears of corn

Answer: 357
