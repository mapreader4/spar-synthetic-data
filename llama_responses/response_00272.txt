Let's first calculate the total money Oliver has:

Oliver has 10 $20 bills and 3 $5 bills. To find the total, we multiply 10 by 20 and 3 by 5:

10 x 20 = 200
3 x 5 = 15

So Oliver has a total of 200 + 15 = 215 dollars.

William has 15 $10 bills and 4 $5 bills. To find the total, we multiply 15 by 10 and 4 by 5:

15 x 10 = 150
4 x 5 = 20

So William has a total of 150 + 20 = 170 dollars.

Now, let's compare the total money Oliver has with the total money William has:

Oliver has 215 dollars and William has 170 dollars. To find the difference, we subtract 170 from 215:

215 - 170 = 45

So Oliver has 45 dollars more money than William.

Answer: 45
