Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total number of hours Carl needs to drive in a day. He needs to drive for 2 hours every day, so that's 2 hours per day.

To find the total number of hours he needs to drive in a week, we can multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

2 hours per day * 7 days = 14 hours

Now, Carl got promoted and now needs to drive for 6 more hours every week. We can add these extra hours to the total hours he needs to drive in a week:

14 hours (previous total) + 6 hours = 20 hours

So, the total number of hours Carl will drive in two weeks is:

Answer: 20
