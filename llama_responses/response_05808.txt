Let's start by defining the variables.

Let the total time spent cleaning the room be x.

Lilly and Fiona took 8 hours to clean the room. So, the total time spent cleaning the room is 8 hours.

A quarter of the time spent cleaning was by Lilly. So, Lilly spent 8/4 = 2 hours cleaning.

The remaining time spent cleaning was by Fiona. So, the time spent by Fiona cleaning is 8 - 2 = 6 hours.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 6
