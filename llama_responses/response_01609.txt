Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, the bottle has 4 liters of water.

Kimberly drinks a quarter of the water, which is 1 liter.

The bottle now has 4 - 1 = 3 liters of water left.

Then, she drinks 2/3rd of the remaining water. To find this amount, we can multiply the remaining water by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 3 by 2/3.

3 * 2/3 = 2.

So, Kimberly drinks 2 liters of water, leaving 1 liter in the bottle.
