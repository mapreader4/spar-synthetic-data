Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: First, we need to find the total number of teeth Vann will clean for dogs. Vann will clean 5 dogs, so that is 5 x 42 = 210 teeth.

Step 2: Next, we need to find the total number of teeth Vann will clean for cats. Vann will clean 10 cats, so that is 10 x 30 = 300 teeth.

Step 3: Next, we need to find the total number of teeth Vann will clean for pigs. Vann will clean 7 pigs, so that is 7 x 28 = 196 teeth.

Step 4: Now, we need to add up the total number of teeth Vann will clean for dogs, cats, and pigs. 210 + 300 + 196 = 506 teeth.

Answer: 506
