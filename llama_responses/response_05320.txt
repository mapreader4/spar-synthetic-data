Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The bathtub's faucet drips at a rate of 40 ml/minute. So, in an hour, the total amount of water that drips out is 40 x 60 = 2400 ml.

2. The bathtub loses 200 ml of water per hour due to evaporation. So, in 9 hours, the total amount of water lost due to evaporation is 200 x 9 = 1800 ml.

3. After the water is turned off, Jack dumps out 12 liters, which is 12000 ml, from the bathtub. So, the total amount of water in the bathtub is 2400 + 1800 - 12000 = 3600 ml.

Answer: 3600
