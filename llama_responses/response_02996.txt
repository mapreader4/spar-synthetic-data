Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many miles the car will drive in total. Today, the car drives 400 miles. Tomorrow, it will drive 200 more miles than today. So, the total number of miles driven is 400 + 200 = 600 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas the car will consume for these 600 miles. We know that the car consumes 4 gallons of gas per mile, so for 1 mile, it consumes 4 gallons. To find out how many gallons it will consume for 600 miles, we multiply 4 gallons per mile by 600 miles. This gives us:

4 gallons/mile * 600 miles = 2400 gallons

So, the car will consume 2400 gallons of gas.

Answer: 2400
