Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the number of penguins the zoo has. The problem states that the zoo has 21 penguins.

Next, it says that the zoo has twice as many polar bears. To find the number of polar bears, we need to multiply the number of penguins by 2.

21 x 2 = 42

So, the zoo has 42 polar bears.

Now, to find the total number of animals, we need to add the number of penguins and the number of polar bears. We can do this by adding 21 + 42.

21 + 42 = 63

Answer: 63
