Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of chickens on the farm now.
Michael has 550 chickens.

Step 2: Determine how the number of chickens will increase each year.
The number of chickens increases by 150 annually.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years.
The number of years is 9.

Step 4: Calculate the total increase in chickens.
The number of chickens will increase by 150 each year. To find the total increase, multiply the number of years by the number of chickens that increase annually.
150 * 9 = 1350

Step 5: Add the initial number of chickens to the total increase in chickens.
550 + 1350 = 1900

Answer: 1900
