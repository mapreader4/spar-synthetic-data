Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's let the number of koi fish be x.

We know that 14 is less than 2 times x, so we can set up an inequality to represent this:

2x < 14

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the inequality by 2:

x < 14 / 2
x < 7

So, x must be less than 7.

Now, we know that the total number of koi fish is 64. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x = 64

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 64 / 2
x = 32

So, we will find 32 koi fish in the pond.
