Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The class has 18 students in total.
2. The students are split into 3 groups, so each group has 18 / 3 = 6 students.
3. Each student takes 4 minutes to go through the museum, so each group takes 6 students * 4 minutes = 24 minutes to go through the museum.
