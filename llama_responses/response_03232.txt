Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Grey sold the house to Mr. Brown at a profit of 10%. This means that Mr. Brown bought the house for $100,000 and sold it for a price that is 10% more than that. To find the selling price, we can multiply the original price by (1 + 0.1) = 1.1.

100,000 x 1.1 = 110,000

So, Mr. Brown bought the house for $110,000.

2. Mr. Brown sold the house to his friend with a 10% loss. This means that the selling price is 10% less than the buying price. To find the selling price, we can multiply the buying price by (1 - 0.1) = 0.9.

110,000 x 0.9 = 99,000

So, Mr. Brown sold the house for $99,000.

Answer: 99,000
