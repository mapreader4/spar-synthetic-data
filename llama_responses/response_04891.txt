Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Mr. Sean charges $60 to treat a dog, and $40 to care for a cat. So, for a dog, the cost is $60. For a cat, the cost is $40.

Step 2: Mr. Khalil took 20 dogs to the clinic for treatment. So, the total cost for the dogs is 20 x $60 = $1200.

Step 3: Mr. Khalil also took 60 cats to the clinic for treatment. So, the total cost for the cats is 60 x $40 = $2400.

Step 4: To find the total amount Mr. Khalil paid, we add the cost for the dogs and the cost for the cats: $1200 + $2400 = $2520.

Answer: 2520
