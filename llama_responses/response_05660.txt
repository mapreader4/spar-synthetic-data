Let's break this down step by step:

On Monday, Mr. Willson worked for 3/4 of an hour, which is equal to 0.75 hours.

On Tuesday, he worked for half an hour, which is equal to 0.5 hours.

On Wednesday, he worked for 2/3 of an hour, which is equal to 0.67 hours.

On Thursday, he worked for 5/6 of an hour, which is equal to 0.83 hours.

On Friday, he worked for 75 minutes, which is equal to 1.25 hours.

To find the total number of hours he worked from Monday to Friday, we add up the hours:

0.75 + 0.5 + 0.67 + 0.83 + 1.25 = 3.55 hours
