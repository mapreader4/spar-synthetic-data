Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the first week. They packed 40 apples in each box, and they made 50 boxes. So, the total number of apples packed in the first week is:

40 apples per box * 50 boxes = 2000 apples

Now, let's look at the second week. They packed 500 fewer apples per day, which is 40 - 500 = 540 apples per box. So, they made:

40 apples per box * 540 boxes = 21600 apples

The total number of apples packed in the two weeks is the sum of the apples packed in each week:

2000 apples + 21600 apples = 21600 apples

Answer: 21600
