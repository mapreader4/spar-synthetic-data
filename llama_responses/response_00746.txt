Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first identify the ratio: 2:1:3. This means that for every 2 parts, there are 3 parts.

Let's say Sandra's share is x.

So, the total amount of money is 50, and Amy got 50. We know that Amy's share is 1 part, since the ratio is 1:1:3.

So, Sandra's share is 2 parts. We can represent this with the equation:

2x = 50

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 1:

x = 25

So, Sandra got 25.

Answer: 25
