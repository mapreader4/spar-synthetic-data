To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total distance that Jessica's family will travel. Since they are traveling at a rate of 50 km/h, and they are 300 km away from New York, it will take them:

300 km / 50 km/h = 6 hours

Since they will stop to rest for 30 minutes every 2 hours, they will stop 3 times during their journey. Therefore, the total time it will take them to reach New York is:

6 hours + (3 x 0.5 hours) = 6 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours
