Let's break this problem down step by step.

The winner runs 24 laps around the school. One lap is 100 meters. So the total distance is 24 * 100 = 2400 meters. The winner earns $3.5 for every 100 meters, so the total earnings are 2400 * 3.5 = 8400. The total earnings are divided by the 12 minutes. So the average earnings per minute are 8400 / 12 = 700. The answer is: Answer: 700.
