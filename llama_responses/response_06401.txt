Let's think step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of fish caught by Leo. Leo caught 40 fish.

Next, let's find the number of fish caught by Agrey. Agrey caught 20 more fish than Leo. So, the number of fish caught by Agrey is 40 + 20 = 60.

To find the total number of fish they caught together, we add the number of fish caught by Leo and Agrey. 40 + 60 = 100.

Answer: 100
