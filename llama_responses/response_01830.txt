Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of ice Chad will need in total. Since there will be 15 people, and he needs 2 pounds of ice per person, he will need a total of:

15 people x 2 pounds per person = 30 pounds of ice.

Next, we need to find out how many packs of ice he will need. Since one pound bags of ice are sold for $3.00 for a pack of 10, we can find the cost per pound of ice as follows:

$3.00 per pack of 10 pounds = $0.30 per pound.

Now, we can find the total cost of the ice by multiplying the total pounds needed by the cost per pound:

30 pounds of ice x $0.30 per pound = $9.00.
