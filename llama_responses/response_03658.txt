Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the 20 tickets that were pre-bought. Since each ticket cost $155, the total cost is:

20 x $155 = $3100

Now, let's find the total cost of the 30 tickets that were bought at the gate. Since each ticket cost $200, the total cost is:

30 x $200 = $6000

To find the difference between the two costs, we subtract the cost of the pre-bought tickets from the cost of the tickets bought at the gate:

$6000 - $3100 = $2900

So, the people who bought their tickets at the gate paid $2900 more than those who pre-bought their tickets.

Answer: 2900
