Let's start by identifying the total number of people participating in the Easter egg hunt. There are 2 kids and their 10 friends, so there are a total of 2 + 10 = 12 children. There are also 7 adults, including Shonda. So, there are 12 children and 1 adult, making a total of 12 + 1 = 13 people participating in the Easter egg hunt.

Next, we need to find the total number of Easter eggs available. There are 15 Easter egg baskets and each basket holds 12 Easter eggs. To find the total number of Easter eggs, we multiply the number of baskets by the number of eggs per basket: 15 x 12 = 180 Easter eggs.

Now, we need to divide the total number of Easter eggs by the number of people participating in the Easter egg hunt. We can do this by dividing 180 by 13: 180 รท 13 = 13.8. However, since we cannot divide Easter eggs into fractions, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 13.

Answer: 13
