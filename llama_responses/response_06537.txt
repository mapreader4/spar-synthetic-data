Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Alice purchased 3600 acorns.
* Bob paid nine times the price for the acorns, so we can represent this as 9x.
* Bob paid $6000 for his acorns.

We can set up an equation using the information given:

9x = 6000

We can solve for x, the price of one acorn, by dividing both sides by 9:

x = 6000 / 9

x = 666

Answer: 666
