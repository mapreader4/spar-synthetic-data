Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of people who took each drink:

1. 26 people took wine.
2. 22 people took soda.
3. 17 people took both wine and soda.

We can combine these numbers to find the total number of people at the gathering:

26 + 22 + 17 = 65

So, the answer is:

Answer: 65
