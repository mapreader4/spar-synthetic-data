Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of 10 books. The cost of each book is $5, so the total cost of 10 books is 10 x 5 = 50.

Next, we need to find the discount. The discount is $0.5 per book, and there are 10 books, so the total discount is 10 x 0.5 = 5.

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost of the books. 50 - 5 = 45.

Answer: 45
