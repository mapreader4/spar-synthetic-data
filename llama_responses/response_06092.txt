Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many rolls Stella buys in a week. Since Stella buys 1 roll a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of rolls she buys in a week is:

1 roll/day x 7 days = 7 rolls

Next, we need to find out how many packs she buys. Since each pack contains 1 dozen rolls, and there are 12 rolls in a dozen, we can set up a proportion to find the number of packs:

1 pack = 12 rolls
1 roll = 1/12 of a pack

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the number of packs:

12 rolls / 1 roll = 12/1

Since Stella buys 7 rolls in a week, we can multiply this proportion by 7:

12/1 x 7 = 84

So Stella buys 84 rolls in a week.

Now, we need to find out how many packs she buys. Since each pack contains 12 rolls, we can divide the total number of rolls by 12:

84 rolls / 12 = 7

Stella buys 7 packs of toilet paper.
