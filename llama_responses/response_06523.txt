Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the dinner plates. The problem states that the dinner plates cost 50% as much as the silverware. So, if the silverware costs $20, then the dinner plates cost $20 x 0.5 = $10.

The total cost of the dinner plates is $10.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the silverware and dinner plates. The silverware costs $20, and the dinner plates cost $10. To find the total cost, we can simply add the cost of the silverware and dinner plates: $20 + $10 = $30.

So, John paid $30 for everything.
