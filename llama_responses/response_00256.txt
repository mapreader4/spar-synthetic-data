Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. We know that 1 inch represents 8 miles, so we can set up a conversion factor:

1 inch = 8 miles

2. We know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map, which means we need to convert 3 3/8 to miles:

3 3/8 = 3/8 Ã— 8 = 3/1 = 3 miles

So, the actual distance between the towns is 3 miles.
