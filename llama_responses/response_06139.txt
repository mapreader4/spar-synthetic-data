Let's break down the costs of the items Rose wants to buy:

* Paintbrush: $2.40
* Set of paints: $9.20
* Easel: $6.50

Total cost of items: $2.40 + $9.20 + $6.50 = $18.10

Rose has $7.10. To find out how much more money Rose needs, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she has:

$18.10 - $7.10 = $11.00

Rose needs $11.00 more.
