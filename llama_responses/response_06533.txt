Let's start by letting x be the amount of water Tony drank two days ago. We know that Tony drank 4% less than that amount yesterday, so the amount he drank yesterday is 4% of x less than x, which is x - 0.04x. We know that Tony drank 48 ounces of water yesterday, so we can set up an equation:

x - 0.04x = 48

We can add 0.04x to both sides of the equation to get:

x = 48 / 0.96

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.96:

x = 50

So, Tony drank 50 ounces of water two days ago.
