To find the number of minutes spent calling clients, we need to subtract the number of minutes spent on accounting from the total number of minutes worked.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's start with the total number of minutes worked: 560 minutes.
2. Since Maryann spends 7 times as long on accounting, that means she spent 7 times 7 minutes on accounting. So, the time spent on accounting is 7 x 7 = 49 minutes.
3. To find the time spent calling clients, we subtract the time spent on accounting from the total time worked: 560 - 49 = 511.

Answer: 511
