Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The new apartment is 40% more expensive than John's old apartment, which costs $1200 per month. This means the new apartment costs 1200 * (1 + 0.4) = 1680 per month.

2. To find out how much John saves per year, we need to subtract the cost of the old apartment from the cost of the new apartment. The difference is 1680 - 1200 = 480.

3. Since John is splitting the cost with his two brothers, the amount he saves per year is 480 / 3 = 160.

Answer: 160
