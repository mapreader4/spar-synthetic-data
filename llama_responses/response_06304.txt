Let's break this problem down step by step.

Joshua collected 80 rocks.
Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua, which means Jose collected 80 - 14 = 66 rocks.
Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose. So Albert collected 66 + 20 = 86 rocks.

Albert collected 86 - 80 = 6 more rocks than Joshua.
