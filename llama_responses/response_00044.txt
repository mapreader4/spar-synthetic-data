Let's break down James' budget step by step.

James has a budget of $1000. He spends 30% of his money on food, which is 0.3 x 1000 = $300. He spends 15% on accommodation, which is 0.15 x 1000 = $150. He spends 25% on entertainment, which is 0.25 x 1000 = $250. 

So, James has $1000 - $300 - $150 - $250 left, which is $500. This is the amount he spends on coursework materials.
