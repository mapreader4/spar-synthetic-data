Let's start by using the information that Issac bought 12 more than 5 times the number of pencils than pens. This means that if we let the number of pencils be x, then the number of pens is x - 5. So, we can write an equation to solve for x.

Let's start with the information that the total number of writing utensils is 108. Since there are 12 more pencils than pens, we can write:

x - 5 + x = 108

We can solve for x by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

x - 5 + x = 108
x - 5 - 5 = 108 - 5
x = 103

So, Issac bought 103 pens.
