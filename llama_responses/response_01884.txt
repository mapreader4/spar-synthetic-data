Let's start by finding the weight of the filling material.

The sand is 40% heavier than sand, so the filling material is 1.4 times heavier than sand. The weight of the filling material is 0.4 times the weight of the sand.

The weight of the sand is 250 pounds, so the weight of the filling material is 0.4 x 250 = 100 pounds.

The bag is 80% full, so the total weight of the bag is 0.8 times the weight of the filling material. 0.8 x 100 = 80 pounds.

Answer: 80
