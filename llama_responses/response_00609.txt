Let's break it down step by step.

Angie has a monthly income of $80. She contributes $42 for necessities. So, she has $38 left over for the month. She pays a share of the household taxes. So, if the total household taxes are $x, then she must have paid $38 - $x. We know that $38 is left over, so we can set up the equation: $38 = $38 - $x. To solve for x, we subtract 38 from both sides of the equation, which gives us $0 = $38 - $x. We can subtract 38 from both sides of the equation to get $x = 38. So, Angie paid $38 in taxes this month.
