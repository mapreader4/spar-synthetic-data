Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that there were 100 cars in the front parking lot. We also know that there were two times more cars at the back than in the front parking lot. So, we can write that as an equation:

100 + 2x = 700

We know that 100 + 2x = 700, so we can solve for x.

100 + 2x = 700

We can subtract 100 from both sides of the equation:

100 + 2x = 600

We can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

(100 + 2x)/2 = 600/2

We can simplify the right side of the equation:

x = 300

So, the answer is:

Answer: 300
