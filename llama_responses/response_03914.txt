Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the time it took Tony to solve the first puzzle is x minutes. Since it took him 10 minutes to solve the first puzzle, the time it took to solve the first puzzle is 10 minutes.

The second puzzle took 3 times as long, so the time it took to solve the second puzzle is 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

The third puzzle took the same amount of time as the second puzzle, so the time it took to solve the third puzzle is also 30 minutes.

The total time it took Tony to solve the puzzles is the sum of the time it took to solve each puzzle, which is 10 + 30 + 30 = 70 minutes.
