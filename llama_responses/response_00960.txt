Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with Cindy, who is 5 years old.

Her sister Jan is 2 years older than Cindy, so Jan is 5 + 2 = 7 years old.

Marcia is twice as old as Jan, so Marcia is 7 x 2 = 14 years old.

Greg is 2 years older than Marcia, so Greg is 14 + 2 = 16 years old.

Answer: 16
