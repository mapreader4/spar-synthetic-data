Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information given: Ben spends 20% of his after-tax income on his car. This means that 20% of his after-tax income is 400, so we can write an equation:

0.20x = 400

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.20:

x = 400 / 0.20
x = 2000

So Ben's after-tax income is 2000. Now, we need to find his gross income. We know that he pays 1/3 of his gross income in taxes. So, his tax amount is 1/3 of his gross income. Let's call his gross income y. Then, we can set up an equation:

1/3y = 2000

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 3:

y = 2000 * 3
y = 6000

So, Ben's gross income is 6000.
