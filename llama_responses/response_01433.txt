Let's break down the information given:

Hank Aaron has 755 home runs, and Dave Winfield has 2 times as many home runs as Hank Aaron. So, we can set up an equation:

755 = 2 * X

To solve for X, we can divide both sides by 2:

X = 755 / 2
X = 377.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a home run, we know that Dave Winfield hit 376 home runs.

Answer: 376
