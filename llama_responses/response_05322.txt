Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information given to create an equation. We know that Joe has 8 times as many fish as Sam, and Sam has 7 fish. So, we can write an equation for the number of fish Joe has:

Joe's fish = 8 * Sam's fish
Joe's fish = 8 * 7
Joe's fish = 56

We know that Harry has 4 times as many fish as Joe, so we can use this information to find the number of fish Harry has:

Harry's fish = 4 * Joe's fish
Harry's fish = 4 * 56
Harry's fish = 224

Answer: 224
