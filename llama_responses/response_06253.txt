Let's start by listing the number of licks each person takes to get to the center of a lollipop:

* Dan takes 58 licks
* Michael takes 63 licks
* Sam and David each take 70 licks
* Lance takes 39 licks

To find the average, we need to add up the number of licks and divide by the number of people:

58 + 63 + 70 + 70 + 39 = 241

There are 4 people in total. To find the average, we divide the sum by 4:

241 รท 4 = 60.25

So, the average number of licks it takes to get to the center of a lollipop is 60.25.
