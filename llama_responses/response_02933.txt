Let's break this down step by step.

There are 235 books initially. On Tuesday, 227 books are taken out, so we subtract 227 from 235 to get:

235 - 227 = 8

So, there are 8 books left.

On Thursday, 56 books are brought back, so we add 56 to the 8 books we have:

8 + 56 = 64

So, there are now 64 books.

On Friday, 35 books are taken out again. So, we subtract 35 from 64 to get:

64 - 35 = 29

So, there are now 29 books.

Answer: 29
