Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the discount on the 8 chairs. The chairs are 25% off, so we need to find 25% of the original price of the 8 chairs. 25% of 8 is 2.

Next, we need to find the discounted price of the 8 chairs. The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, which is 20 - 2 = 18.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the chairs. The 5 chairs after the 5th chair are discounted by 1/3. The price of the 6th chair is 18 - 1/3 * 2 = 18 - 2/3 = 12. The price of the 7th and 8th chairs are the same, so we can just multiply 12 by 2 to get the total price of the last 2 chairs, which is 24.

To find the total cost, we add up the prices of the 6 chairs, which is 18, and the 2 chairs, which is 24. The total cost is 18 + 24 = 42.

Answer: 42
