Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: The cans of soda have 12 ounces of soda. Since there are 6 cans, the total weight of the soda is 6 x 12 = 72 ounces.

Step 2: The cans weigh 2 ounces empty. So, the weight of the 6 cans when they are empty is 6 x 2 = 12 ounces.

Step 3: He adds 2 more empty cans. The weight of these cans is 2 x 2 = 4 ounces.

Step 4: The total weight of the bridge must support is the weight of the soda plus the weight of the additional cans. The total weight is 72 (from the soda) + 4 (from the additional cans) = 76 ounces.

Answer: 76
