Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total cost of the shirts. John buys 3 shirts for $20 each, so the total cost is 3 x 20 = 60.

Next, we need to calculate the tax. The tax is 10% of the total cost, which is 10% of 60. 10% of 60 is 6.

The total cost, including the cost of the shirts and the tax, is 60 + 6 = 66.

Answer: 66
