Let's break this down step by step.

1. Mark bought a puppy for $10.
2. He bought enough food for 3 weeks, which means he bought 3 x 7 = 21 cups of food.
3. The puppy eats 1/3 cup of food a day, so for 21 cups of food, he needs 21 / 3 = 7 days worth of food.
4. A bag of food with 3.5 cups costs $2, so the cost per cup is $2 / 3.5 = $0.57.
5. The total cost of the puppy and food is $10 for the puppy + 7 x $0.57 for the food = $10 + 4.03 = $14.03.
