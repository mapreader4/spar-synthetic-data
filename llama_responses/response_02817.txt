Let's break down the time spent in the studio:

* Elvis spends 5 hours in the studio, which is equal to 300 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
* He records each song for 12 minutes, so he records 10 songs for a total of 10 x 12 = 120 minutes.
* He edits all his songs for 30 minutes, which is a one-time task, so that's just 30 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent recording and editing from the total time in the studio:

300 - (120 + 30) = 150 minutes

Since Elvis spent 150 minutes in the studio on writing, and he wrote 10 songs, we can divide the time spent writing by the number of songs to find the time it took to write each song:

150 minutes รท 10 songs = 15 minutes per song

So, it took Elvis 15 minutes to write each song.
