To solve this problem, I will first find the total number of apples that Adam picked in a month. Since Adam picks 4 apples every day for 30 days, he will pick 4 * 30 = 120 apples in a month.

To find the total number of apples Adam has collected in a month, I will multiply the number of apples he picks in a day by the number of days in a month. Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of apples Adam has collected is 4 * 30 = 120.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 120
