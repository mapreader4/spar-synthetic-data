Let's break it down step by step.

Adam earns $40 per day. 10% of his money is deducted as taxes. So, 10% of $40 is $4. After 30 days of work, he will have earned a total of $40 * 30 = $1200. After deducting 10% of the money as taxes, he will have $1200 - $12 = $1080. Therefore, Adam will have $1080 after 30 days of work.
