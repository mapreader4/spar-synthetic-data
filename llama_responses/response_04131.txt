Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

1. Bill's take-home salary is $40,000.
2. He pays $2,000 in property taxes.
3. He pays $3,000 in sales taxes.
4. 10% of his gross salary in income taxes.

To find the gross salary, we need to add the income taxes back to the take-home salary.

Step 1: Calculate the income taxes.
10% of $40,000 is 0.1 x $40,000 = $4,000.

Step 2: Add the income taxes to the take-home salary.
$40,000 + $4,000 = $44,000.

Answer: $44,000
