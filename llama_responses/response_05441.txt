Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the computer costs x dollars.

The TV costs $600.
The fridge costs $500 more than the computer, so the fridge costs $1000.

The total cost of the TV and the fridge is $1600.

So, we know the total cost of the TV and the fridge is $1600. The total cost of the TV and the fridge and the computer is $1600. This means that the cost of the computer is the difference between $1600 and $1000, which is $600.

Answer: 600
