Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how much money Rudy contributed. Since Robi contributed $4000 and Rudy contributed 1/4 more money than Robi, we can set up an equation to represent the amount of money Rudy contributed:

Rudy's contribution = Robi's contribution + 1/4 of Robi's contribution

We know Robi's contribution is $4000, so we can substitute that in:

Rudy's contribution = 4000 + 4000 / 4
Rudy's contribution = 4000 + 1000
Rudy's contribution = 5000

So Rudy contributed $5000.

The total amount of money they have is the sum of Robi's contribution and Rudy's contribution:

Total money = Robi's contribution + Rudy's contribution
Total money = 4000 + 5000
Total money = 9000

They made a profit of 20% of the total amount, so we can set up an equation to represent the profit:

Profit = 20% of total money
Profit = 0.2 x 9000
Profit = 1800

They decided to share the profits equally, so we can divide the profit by 2:

Profit / 2 = 1800 / 2
Profit per person = 900

Answer: 900
