Let's break down the information given into steps.

1. Mike received a total of $160 in wages this week.
2. He received the wages for his first job, so we can let that be represented by x.
3. He received the wages from his second job where he works 12 hours a week.
4. The second job pays $9 per hour, so for 12 hours, he would earn 12 * 9 = 108 dollars.
5. His total wages are $160, so the wages from the first job is $160 - 108 = 52.

Answer: 52
