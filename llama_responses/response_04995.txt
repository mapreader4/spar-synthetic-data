Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: John buys 20 hours of music a month. 20 hours / 60 minutes = 1/3 hours per day, which is 1/3 songs per day.

Step 2: Each song is 3 minutes long. So, 1/3 songs per day * 3 minutes per song = 3 minutes per day.

Step 3: There are 12 months in a year. 3 minutes per day * 12 months = 36 minutes per year.

Step 4: John buys each song for $.50. 36 minutes * $.50 = $18.
