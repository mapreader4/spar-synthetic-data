To find the number of calories remaining in the block, we need to subtract the number of calories already eaten from the total number of calories in the block.

Total calories in a block: 16 servings * 110 calories per serving = 1760 calories
Calories eaten: 5 servings * 110 calories per serving = 550 calories

To find the calories remaining, we subtract 550 from 1760:

Answer: 1760 - 550 = 1210
