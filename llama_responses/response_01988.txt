Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the initial value of Brandon's investment: 500 x 0.2 = 100.

Now, let's calculate the final value of Jackson's investment: 500 x 4 = 2000.

Now, let's find the difference between the two values: 2000 - 100 = 1900.

So, Jackson has 1900 more dollars than Brandon.
