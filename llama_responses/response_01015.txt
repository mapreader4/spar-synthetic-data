Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many oranges Timmy needs to buy to get 400 calories.

We know that each orange has 80 calories, so to get 400 calories, Timmy would need:

400 calories / 80 calories per orange = 5 oranges

So, Timmy needs to buy 5 oranges.

The cost of 5 oranges is:

5 x $1.20 = $6.00

Timmy has $10 initially, so he will be left with:

$10 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, after buying the oranges, Timmy will have $4.00 left.

Answer: 4.00
