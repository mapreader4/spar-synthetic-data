Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Mrs. Snyder's monthly income is x.

Since she spends 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities, the amount she spends on rent and utilities is 0.4x.

After her salary increased by $600, her rent and utilities now only amount to 25% of her monthly income. So, the new amount she spends on rent and utilities is 0.25x.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

0.25x = 0.4x + 600

Now, we can solve for x.

First, we can subtract 0.4x from both sides of the equation:

0.25x - 0.4x = 600

This gives us:

0.05x = 600

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100 to get:

x = 600 / 0.05

x = 12,000

So, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $12,000.
