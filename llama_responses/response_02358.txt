Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the cost of the pencils. A pencil costs $0.5 each, and we need 2 dozen pencils. So, the cost of the pencils is:

0.5 * 2 = 1.0

Now, let's calculate the cost of the folders. A folder costs $0.9 each, and we need 20 folders. So, the cost of the folders is:

0.9 * 20 = 18.0

Now, let's add the cost of the pencils and folders together:

1.0 + 18.0 = 19.0

So, it would cost 19.0 to buy the office supplies.
