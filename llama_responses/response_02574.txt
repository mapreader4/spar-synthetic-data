Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with Yvonne, who swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  We know that 10 laps in 5 minutes is the same as 2 laps per minute.  So, Yvonne can swim 2 laps per minute.

Now, the younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  So, she can swim 1 lap per minute, or 0.5 laps per minute.

Joel is the brother, and he can swim three times the number of laps as the younger sister.  So, he can swim 1.5 laps per minute, or 3 times the number of laps as the younger sister.

To find out how many laps Joel can swim in 5 minutes, we can multiply 3 times the number of laps the younger sister can swim per minute by 5 minutes.

So, 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 laps per minute * 5 minutes = 7.5 laps.

Answer: 7.5
