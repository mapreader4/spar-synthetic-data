Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Amanda has taken 4 quizzes and has averaged a 92% score on them. This means that the sum of her scores is 4 x 92 = 368.

The final quiz is worth the same as each previous quiz, so the total score for all 5 quizzes is 5 x? = 368. We can set up an equation to represent this: 5x = 368.

To get an A in the class, Amanda needs to average 93% over the 5 quizzes. This means that the average score needs to be 5 x 93 = 465.

We can set up an equation to represent this: 5x = 465. To solve for x, we can subtract 368 from both sides of the equation: 5x - 368 = 465 - 368.

This simplifies to x = 97. Amanda needs a score of 97 on the final quiz to get an A in the class.
