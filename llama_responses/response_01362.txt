Let's start by identifying the total number of gumballs they had initially: 40 + 60 = 100 gumballs.

Then, they purchased 4 times the number of gumballs they had initially, so they purchased 4 x 100 = 400 gumballs.

Now, they added these to their dishes, so they now have a total of 100 + 400 = 500 gumballs.

Since they decided to share them equally, they will divide the total number of gumballs by 2, so each will get 500 / 2 = 250 gumballs.
