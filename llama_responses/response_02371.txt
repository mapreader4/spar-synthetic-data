Let's break this problem down step by step.

Tommy's mother lets him ride his bike:

2 blocks north = 2 blocks
3 blocks east = 3 blocks
2 blocks west = -2 blocks (because he is going in the opposite direction)
2 blocks south = -2 blocks (because he is going in the opposite direction)

So, Tommy's total distance is 2 + 3 - 2 - 2 = 1 block.

His friend's father lets his friend ride his bike 80 square blocks.

To find the area, we need to multiply the number of blocks by the number of blocks per side. So, it's 80 * 80 = 6400 square blocks.

To find the difference between the two, we need to subtract 1 block from 6400. So, it's 6400 - 1 = 6399.

Answer: 6399
