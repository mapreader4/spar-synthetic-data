Let's start by identifying the given information.

* Jason was paid 60 more coins than Jayden.
* Jayden received 300 coins.

We can translate the sentence to an equation.

Jason received x + 60 more coins than Jayden, so Jayden received x coins. 

Since Jason received 60 more coins than Jayden, that means that Jason received 60 + x coins. 

Now, we know that Jason received 60 + x coins, and Jayden received x coins. 

We know that the total number of coins given by Mrs. Jane to the boys is the sum of the coins received by Jason and Jayden.

The equation for the total number of coins given by Mrs. Jane is x + 300.

Since we know that Jason received 60 + x coins, we can write an equation for the total number of coins given:

x + 300 = 60 + x

We can solve the equation by subtracting 60 from both sides.

x + 300 - 60 = x

x = 240

So, Mrs. Jane gave the boys a total of 240 coins.
