Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that if Beth had $35 more, she would have $105. This means that Beth has $105 - $35 = $70.

Next, we know that if Jan had $10 less, he would have the same money as Beth has. This means that Jan has $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Beth and Jan have altogether. We can do this by adding the money they each have:

Beth has $70 and Jan has $60. To find the total amount of money they have, we add $70 + $60 = $130.

Answer: 130
