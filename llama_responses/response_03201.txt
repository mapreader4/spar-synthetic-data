Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Each member baked 10 sheets of cookies.
2. Each sheet has 16 cookies.
3. To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of sheets by the number of cookies per sheet.

So, we multiply 10 sheets by 16 cookies per sheet:

10 * 16 = 160

Answer: 160
