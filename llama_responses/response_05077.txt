Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many pages Lance has left to read. He has 100 pages to read initially, and he has already read 35 pages. So, he has 100 - 35 = 65 pages left to read.

Yesterday, he read 5 fewer pages than the day before. This means that yesterday, he read 35 + 5 = 40 pages. So, he has 65 - 40 = 25 pages left to read.

To finish the book in 2 days, Lance needs to read 25 pages a day. So, he should read 25 pages tomorrow.
