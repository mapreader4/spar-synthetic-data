Let's break this problem down step by step.

Bob bought 2 dogs for $250.00 each, so the total cost is 2 x 250.00 = $500.00.

He has a litter of 6 puppies, and he sells each puppy for $350.00. So, the total revenue from selling the puppies is 6 x 350.00 = $2100.00.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue. So, the profit is 2100.00 - 500.00 = $1600.00.

Answer: 1600.00
