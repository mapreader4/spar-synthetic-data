Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find out how many marshmallows Joe's dad has. He has 21 marshmallows, and Joe has four times as much as his dad, so Joe has 21 * 4 = 84 marshmallows.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows they roasted. Joe's dad roasted a third of his marshmallows, which is 21 / 3 = 7 marshmallows. Joe roasted half of his marshmallows, which is 84 / 2 = 42 marshmallows.

To find the total number of marshmallows they roasted, we add the number of marshmallows roasted by Joe's dad and Joe. 7 + 42 = 49.

Answer: 49
