Let's start by listing the number of stuffed animals Willy has initially: 10. Then, his mom gives him 2 more. So, he has 10 + 2 = 12 stuffed animals. After that, his dad gives him 3 times more stuffed animals than he has. So, his dad gives him 3 x 12 = 36 stuffed animals. Therefore, the total number of stuffed animals Willy has after his dad gives him the additional stuffed animals is 12 + 36 = 48. So, the answer is: Answer: 48.
