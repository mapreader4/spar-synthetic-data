Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with what we know: the area of the rectangle is 100 m2. We know that the area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width. So, if the area is 100 m2, we can set up an equation:

Area = Length * Width

We know that the area is 100, so we can rewrite the equation like this:

100 = Length * Width

Now, we want to solve for the length. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the width, like this:

100 / Width = Length

This will give us the length of the rectangle.

Answer: 10
