Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the price of the first house is x. Since the second house is twice as expensive as the first one, the price of the second house is 2x.

The problem states that the total price of both houses together is $600,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 600,000

Combine like terms:

3x = 600,000

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 200,000

So, the price of the first house is $200,000.

Answer: 200000
