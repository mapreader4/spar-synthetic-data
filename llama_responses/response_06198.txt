Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Keith scored 3 points.
* Larry scored 3 times as many marks as Keith, which means Larry scored 3 * 3 = 9 marks.
* Danny scored 5 more marks than Larry, which means Danny scored 9 + 5 = 14 marks.

To find the total amount of marks scored by the three students, we need to add up their scores:

Keith: 3
Larry: 9
Danny: 14

Adding these up, we get:
3 + 9 + 14 = 26

Answer: 26
