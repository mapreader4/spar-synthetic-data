To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of pitches that Macy and Piper got. Macy got 15 pitches, and Piper got 15 pitches. So the total number of pitches they got is 15 + 15 = 30. Then, I will calculate the total number of times they hit the ball. Macy hit the ball 50 times, and Piper hit the ball 55 times. So the total number of times they hit the ball is 50 + 55 = 105. Now, to find the number of pitches they missed, I will subtract the total number of times they hit the ball from the total number of pitches they got. 30 - 105 = 75. Macy and Piper missed 75 pitches altogether.
