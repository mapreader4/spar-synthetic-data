Let's break this down step by step.

Peggy initially has 6 dolls.

Her grandmother gives her 30 dolls, so she now has 6 + 30 = 36 dolls.

Over the year, she receives half that amount of dolls between her birthday and Christmas. That's half of 30, which is 15 dolls. So, she receives 15 more dolls.

Now, we need to add the 15 dolls she received to the 36 dolls she already has. 36 + 15 = 51.

Answer: 51
