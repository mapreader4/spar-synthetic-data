Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of male students who like to play basketball. Since 2/3 of the students like to play basketball, that is the same as saying that 2/3 of the students are male students. We know that the ratio of male to female students is 3:2, which means that the number of male students is 3x, and the number of female students is 2x. The total number of students is 3x + 2x = 5x. We know that the total number of students is 1000, so we can set up the equation 3x + 2x = 1000. To solve for x, we can subtract 2x from both sides of the equation to get 3x = 1000 - 2x. Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get x = 1000/3 - 2x/3. Since 2x is equal to 2/3 of the students, we know that 2x is 2/3 of 1000/3, so 2x is 400. So, 2x is 400. We can substitute this value into our equation to get x = 1000/3 - 2x/3 = 1000/3 - 400/3 = 200. So, the number of students who do not like to play basketball is the remaining students, which is 1000 - 200 = 800. To find the percent of the population that do not like to play basketball, we can divide the number of students who do not like to play basketball by the total number of students, which is 1000, to get 800/1000 = 80%. So, the answer is:

Answer: 80
