Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Nancy sliced the pie into 8 pieces.

Step 2: She gave 1/2 to Joe and Darcy. That means she gave away 4 slices.

Step 3: She gave 1/4 to Carl. That means she gave away 2 slices.

Step 4: So, in total, Nancy gave away 4 + 2 = 6 slices.

Step 5: Since there were 8 slices originally, Nancy has 8 - 6 = 2 slices left.

Answer: 2
