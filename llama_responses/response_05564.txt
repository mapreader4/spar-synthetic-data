Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Mrs. Johnson's class raised $2300. Since Mrs. Sutton's class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin's class, we can set up an equation to represent the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton's class:

Mrs. Sutton's class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin's class, so Mrs. Sutton's class raised 1/8 of the amount raised by Miss Rollin's class. Let's call the amount raised by Miss Rollin's class x. Then, Mrs. Sutton's class raised x/8.

We know that Mrs. Johnson's class raised twice the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton's class, so we can set up another equation:

Mrs. Johnson's class raised 2 x (x/8) = 2300

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 8:

2x = 2300 x 8
2x = 18400
x = 9200

So Miss Rollin's class raised $9200.

Now, we know that Miss Rollin's class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. The total amount raised by the school is the sum of the amounts raised by each class:

Total amount raised = Mrs. Johnson's class + Mrs. Sutton's class + Miss Rollin's class
Total amount raised = 2300 + (x/8) + x
Total amount raised = 2300 + 9200

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

Total amount raised = 11500

Finally, 2% will be deducted for administration fees. To find the amount after deduction, we multiply the total amount raised by 0.98 (100% - 2%):

Amount after deduction = 11500 x 0.98
Amount after deduction = 11330

Answer: 11330
