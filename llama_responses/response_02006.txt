The membership fee increases by 10 dollars each year. If he pays 80 dollars in the first year, then in the second year, he would pay 80 + 10 = 90 dollars. In the third year, he would pay 90 + 10 = 100 dollars. In the fourth year, he would pay 100 + 10 = 110 dollars. In the fifth year, he would pay 110 + 10 = 120 dollars. In the sixth year, he would pay 120 + 10 = 130 dollars. So, his membership cost in the sixth year is 130.
