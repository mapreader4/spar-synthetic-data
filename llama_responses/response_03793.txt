Let's break down the total cost of the trip.

The total cost of the Airbnb rental is $3200. The cost of the car rental is $800. To find the total cost of the trip, we add the two costs together:

$3200 + $800 = $4000

Since there are 8 people, to find each person's share, we divide the total cost by 8:

$4000 รท 8 = $500

So each person's share would be $500.
