Let's break it down step by step:

Jerry has 6 hawk feathers. He has 17 times as many eagle feathers as hawk feathers, so he has 17 x 6 = 102 eagle feathers.

He gives 10 feathers to his sister. He has 102 - 10 = 92 feathers left.

He sells half the remaining feathers, which is 92 / 2 = 46 feathers.

So, Jerry has 46 feathers left.
