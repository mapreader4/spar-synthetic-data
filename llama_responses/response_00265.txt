Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find Larry's full height. Since his shoulder height is 20% less than his full height, and he is 5 feet tall, we can set up an equation to solve for his full height:

Let x be Larry's full height. Then, we can write the equation:

x - 0.2x = 5

To solve for x, we can add 0.2x to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / 0.8

x = 5 / 0.8
x = 6.25

So, Larry's full height is 6.25 feet.

Now, since Barry can reach apples that are 5 feet high, and Larry can reach apples that are 6.25 feet high when he stands on Barry's shoulders, we can set up an equation to find the combined height:

6.25 + 5 =?

To solve for the combined height, we can add 6.25 and 5:

6.25 + 5 = 11.25

Answer: 11
