Let's break it down step by step.

The appetizer costs $10, and there are 4 entrees that are $20 each. So, the total cost of the entrees is 4 x 20 = $80. The total cost is the sum of the appetizer and the entrees, which is 10 + 80 = $90. To calculate the 20% tip, we need to multiply the total cost by 0.2. So, 90 * 0.2 = 18. The total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant is the total cost plus the tip, which is 90 + 18 = $108.

Answer: 108
