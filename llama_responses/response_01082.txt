Let's break it down step by step.

Alfred starts with 12 tonnes of maize (1 tonne per month for 12 months). Then, 5 tonnes are stolen, so he has 12 - 5 = 7 tonnes left.

Then, he receives an additional 8 tonnes as a donation, so he now has 7 + 8 = 15 tonnes.

At the end of the 2 years, Alfred will have 15 tonnes.
