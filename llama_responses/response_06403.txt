Let's break this down step by step.

The archer intends to shoot 200 shots per week, and he recovers 20% of his arrows. This means that he gets 20/100 = 0.2 or 20% of his arrows back.

The cost of an arrow is $5.5, so the cost of all the arrows is 200 x $5.5 = $1100.

The archer's team agrees to pay for 70% of the cost of the arrows. 70% of $1100 is 0.7 x $1100 = $770.

So, the archer will spend $770 for arrows in a week.
