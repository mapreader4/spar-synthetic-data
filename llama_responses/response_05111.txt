Let's break this down step by step.

The eldest sibling is 20 years old. This means that the middle child is 15 years old (20 - 5) and the youngest is 10 years old (20 - 5 - 5). 

In 10 years, the eldest will be 30 years old, the middle child will be 25 years old, and the youngest will be 20 years old. 

The total of the ages of the three siblings in 10 years will be 30 + 25 + 20 = 75. 

Answer: 75
