Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of English books: 80% of 2300 books is 0.8 x 2300 = 1840 books.

Now, out of these 1840 books, 60% are published outside the country. 60% of 1840 is 0.6 x 1840 = 110.4.

So, 110.4 is the number of English-language books that were published outside the country.
