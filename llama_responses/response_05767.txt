To solve this problem, I will first find the total number of bananas Jefferson and Walter have. Jefferson has 56 bananas, and Walter has 1/4 of those, so 1/4 * 56 = 14. Therefore, together they have 56 + 14 = 70 bananas. Then, they decide to share the bananas equally. Since they have 70 bananas, and they are going to share them equally, they will each get 70 / 2 = 35 bananas.
