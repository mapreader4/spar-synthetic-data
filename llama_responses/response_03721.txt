Let's start by identifying the cost of each item:

1. 10 packs of gummy bears cost 10 * 2 = 20 dollars
2. 20 bags of chocolate chips cost 20 * 5 = 100 dollars

The total cost of all the items is 20 + 100 = 120 dollars.

The total cost of all the items is 150 dollars, so the cost of 1 chocolate bar must be 150 - 120 = 30 dollars.

Answer: 30
