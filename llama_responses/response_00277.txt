Let's break it down step by step:

Let's say the cost of each of the two other puppies is x.

The total cost of the three puppies that are on sale is 3 x $150 = $450.

The total cost of all five puppies is $800. So, the cost of the two puppies that are not on sale is 800 - 450 = 350.

Since the cost of the two puppies is the same, we can divide 350 by 2 to get the cost of one puppy. 350 รท 2 = 175.

So, each of the two other puppies cost $175.
