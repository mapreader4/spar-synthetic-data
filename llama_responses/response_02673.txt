Let's break this down step by step:

1. Alice saved 10 dollars the first month. So, she had 10 dollars at the end of the first month.
2. She saved 30 more dollars each month. So, in the second month, she added 30 to her savings, making it 10 + 30 = 40 dollars. At the end of the second month, she had 40 dollars.
3. In the third month, she saved 30 more dollars. So, she added 30 to her savings, making it 40 + 30 = 70 dollars. At the end of the third month, she had 70 dollars.

So, the answer is: Answer: 70
