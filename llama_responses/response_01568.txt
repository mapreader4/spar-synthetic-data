Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with Sasha's muffins. Sasha made 30 muffins. Melissa made 4 times as many muffins as Sasha, so Melissa made 4 x 30 = 120 muffins. Tiffany made half of Sasha and Melissa's total number of muffins, which is (30 + 120) / 2 = 75 muffins.

The total number of muffins made by Sasha, Melissa, and Tiffany is 30 + 120 + 75 = 225 muffins. If one muffin sells for $4, then the total amount of money they contribute is 225 x $4 = 900.
