Let's break this problem down step by step.

In the first season, the apple tree produced 200 apples.

In the second season, the tree made 20% fewer fruits than in the first season. So, the number of fruits in the second season is 200 - 20% * 200 = 160.

In the third season, the tree's production doubled. So, the number of fruits in the third season is 160 * 2 = 320.

To find the total number of fruits the apple tree grew in the three seasons, we add the number of fruits in each season:

200 + 160 + 320 = 580

Answer: 580
