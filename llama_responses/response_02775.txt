Let's start by finding the circumference of Charlie's head. We know that Jack's head is 12 inches in circumference, and Charlie's head is 9 inches more than half of Jack's head. So, half of Jack's head is 6 inches, and Charlie's head is 6 + 9 = 15 inches.

Now, we know that Bill's head is 2/3 the circumference of Charlie's head. So, we can find the circumference of Bill's head by multiplying Charlie's circumference by 2/3. 15 * 2/3 = 10. The answer is: Answer: 10
