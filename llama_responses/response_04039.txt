To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to find the time taken for the first 200 miles and the time taken for the last 100 miles.

The time taken for the first 200 miles by Jenna is 200 miles / 50 mph = 4 hours.

The time taken for the last 100 miles by her friend is 100 miles / 20 mph = 5 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of these two times. 4 hours + 5 hours = 9 hours.

Answer: 9
