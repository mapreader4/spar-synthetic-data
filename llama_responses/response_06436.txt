Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's assume that Layla scored x points and Nahima scored y points. The total number of points scored was 112.

We know that the total number of points scored is the sum of the points scored by Layla and Nahima. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x + y = 112.

We know that Layla scored 70 points. So, we can substitute x = 70 into the equation. Then we get:

70 + y = 112

Now, we need to solve for y. We can subtract 70 from both sides of the equation to get:

y = 112 - 70
y = 42

So, Layla scored 42 points more than Nahima.
