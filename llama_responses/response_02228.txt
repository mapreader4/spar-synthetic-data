Let's break it down step by step.

Billy has 4 horses. Each horse eats 4 pounds of oats, twice a day. So each horse eats 8 pounds of oats a day. Since there are 4 horses, the total amount of oats needed for 1 day is 4 * 8 = 32 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats needed for 3 days, we multiply 32 by 3. 32 * 3 = 96 pounds.

Answer: 96
