Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's find the number of oranges in each box first. For the first box, 3/4 of the capacity of 80 is 60 (since 3/4 of 80 is the same as 3 * 20). So, the first box is 60/3 = 20 oranges. For the second box, 3/5 of the capacity of 50 is 30 (since 3/5 of 50 is the same as 3 * 10). So, the second box has 30 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of oranges in both boxes. We can add the number of oranges in each box to get the total: 20 + 30 = 50. So, the total number of oranges the boxes have is 50.
