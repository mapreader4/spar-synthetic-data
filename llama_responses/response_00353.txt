Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the furniture. The cost of a piece of furniture is $134. Since there are 150 pieces of furniture, the total cost is:

150 x 134 = 20,700

The total cost is $20,700.

Since the company's accountant discovered that a new intern in the sales department had overcharged Remy, we need to subtract the overcharge from the total cost. The overcharge is the difference between the total cost and the total cost of the furniture, which is:

20,700 - 20,700 = 0

There is no overcharge. Remy is not owed anything.

Answer: 0
