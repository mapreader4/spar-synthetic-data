Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of students in the class. There are 11 boys and 13 girls, which makes the total number of students 11 + 13 = 24.

Now, if 1 boy is added to the class, the total number of students will be 24 + 1 = 25.

To find the percentage of girls, we can divide the number of girls by the total number of students. 13 girls out of 25 students is equal to 13 / 25 = 0.52.

Answer: 52
