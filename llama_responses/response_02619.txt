Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of people who attended class across all 5 days. We know that 10 people attended on Monday, 15 on Tuesday, and 10 on each day from Wednesday through Friday. So, the total number of people who attended class is:

10 + 15 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 65

Next, we need to find the average. To do this, we divide the total number of people who attended class by the number of days:

65 รท 5 = 13

Answer: 13
