Let's break it down step by step:

Let's start with the information given: Ellen will be 10 years old in 6 years.

To find Martha's age, we need to subtract 6 years from Ellen's future age to get her age now.

Ellen will be 10 years old in 6 years, so her age now is 10 + 6 = 16.

So, Martha's age is 16.

Answer: 16
