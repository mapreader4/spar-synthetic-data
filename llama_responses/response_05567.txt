Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of jelly beans taken by each group of people.

The first 6 people took twice as many jelly beans as the last 4 people. Since the last 4 people took 400 jelly beans, the first 6 people took 2 x 400 = 800 jelly beans.

So, the total number of jelly beans taken by the first 6 people is 800.

Now, we need to subtract the total number of jelly beans taken by the first 6 people from the total initial number of jelly beans, which is 8000.

8000 - 800 = 7200

Answer: 7200
