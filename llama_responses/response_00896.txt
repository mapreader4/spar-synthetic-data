Let's break this down step by step.

Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy round, so she got 6 x 2 = 12 points for the easy round.

Kim got 2 correct answers in the average round, so she got 2 x 3 = 6 points for the average round.

Kim got 4 correct answers in the hard round, so she got 4 x 5 = 20 points for the hard round.

To find Kim's total points, we add up the points from each round: 12 + 6 + 20 = 38.

Answer: 38
