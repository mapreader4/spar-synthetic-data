Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many joggers Alexander bought.

Alexander bought 22 more joggers than Tyson. So, we can set up an equation:

Alexander joggers = Tyson joggers + 22

Let's now find out how many joggers Tyson bought. We know that Christopher bought 80 joggers, so:

Tyson joggers = 80

Now we can substitute this into the equation:

Alexander joggers = 80 + 22

Alexander joggers = 102

Now, we can find out how many joggers Christopher bought more than Alexander:

Christopher joggers - Alexander joggers =?

Christopher joggers - Alexander joggers = 80 - 102 = -22

Christopher bought 22 less joggers than Alexander.

Answer: 22
