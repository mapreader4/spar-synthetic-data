Let's break this down step by step.

There were originally 25 peaches in each basket, and there were 5 baskets. So, there were a total of 25 * 5 = 125 peaches.

The farmers have eaten 5 peaches. So, there are 125 - 5 = 120 peaches left.

The remaining peaches are packed into smaller boxes of 15 each. To find out how many boxes, we need to divide 120 peaches by 15.

120 รท 15 = 8

Answer: 8
