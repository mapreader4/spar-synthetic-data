Let's start by letting $x$ be the current age of the speaker, and let $y$ be the age of the speaker's brother. 

We are told that in 10 years, the speaker will be twice the brother's age, so the speaker will be $x + 10 = 2y$.

The sum of the speaker's age and the brother's age will be 45, so we can set up the equation $x + y = 45$.

We are given that in 10 years, the speaker will be twice the brother's age, so $x + 10 = 2y$. We can substitute this into the equation $x + y = 45$:

$$(x + 10) + y = 45$$

We can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get $x + y = 35$.

Now we know that $x + y = 35$ and $x + 10 = 2y$. We can substitute $x$ with $x + 10$ to get $2y = 35$.

$$(2x) = 35$$

We can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get $x = 17.5$.

So the speaker is 17.5 years old now.
