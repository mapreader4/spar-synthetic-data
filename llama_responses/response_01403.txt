Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the given information: "The first and second numbers are the same."

So, let's say the first number is x.

Then, the second number is also x.

The third number is 0.

The fourth number is 2x, which is 2 times the first number, so it's 2x.

The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8. So, the sum of the fourth and fifth numbers is x + 2x = 8.

We know that the first two numbers are x, so we can write the equation as x + x + 2x = 8.

We are looking for a five-digit number that adds up to 10. So, we can write the equation as x + x + 2x = 10.

Let's solve for x.

x + x + 2x = 10

x + x = 10 - 2x

x = 5

So, the first number is 5.

Now, the first and second numbers are the same, so they are both 5.

The third number is 0.

The fourth number is 2 times the first number, which is 2 times 5, so it's 10.

The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8, but we know that the sum of the fourth and fifth numbers is x + 2x = 10, which means the sum of the fourth and fifth numbers is 10, not 8. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the sum of the fourth and fifth numbers is actually 2.

So, the correct sum of the fourth and fifth numbers is 2.

So, the correct answer is 51202.
