Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The sewers in Middleton can handle 240,000 gallons of runoff.
* Each hour of rain produces 1000 gallons of runoff.

To find the number of days of rain that the sewers can handle, we need to divide the total gallons of runoff (240,000) by the gallons of runoff per hour (1000).

Let's do the division:

240,000 gallons of runoff รท 1000 gallons per hour = 240 hours

So, the answer is:

Answer: 240
