Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The Laker cement factory provided 500 bags of cement to Mr. Zander, and each bag costs $10. So, the total cost of the cement is:

500 bags * $10 per bag = 500 * 10 = $5000

2. Mr. Zander also received twenty lorries of construction sand, and each lorry carries 10 tons of sand. So, the total amount of sand is:

20 lorries * 10 tons per lorry = 200 tons of sand

3. The sand is sold at $40 per ton, so the total cost of the sand is:

200 tons * $40 per ton = 200 * 40 = $8000

4. To find the total amount Mr. Zander paid, we add the cost of the cement and the cost of the sand:

$5000 (cement) + $8000 (sand) = $13000

Answer: 13000
