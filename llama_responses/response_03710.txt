Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the average completion time of the last three students is 35 seconds. We also know that the average completion time of all four runners is 30 seconds. We are asked to find the time it took for the student who came first to finish the race.

Let's use the information given to set up an equation. Let's assume that the time it took for the student who came first to finish the race is represented by x. Since the average time of the last three students is 35 seconds, the average of those three students is the sum of their times divided by 3:

35 = (t1 + t2 + t3) / 3

We are given that the average time of all four runners is 30 seconds. This means that the sum of the times of the four students is 4 * 30 = 120. We can set up an equation:

120 = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4

We know that t1 is the time it took for the student who came first to finish the race. We can subtract the time of the last three students (35) from the sum of the times of all four students (120) to find the time it took for the student who came first to finish the race:

120 - 35 = t1

t1 = 85

So, the time it took for the student who came first to finish the race is 85 seconds.
