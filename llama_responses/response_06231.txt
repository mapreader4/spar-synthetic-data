To solve this problem, I will first find the distance Ms. Warren ran, then add that to the distance she walked.

Ms. Warren ran for 20 minutes at 6 mph. To convert minutes to hours, we multiply by 1/60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, she ran for (20 * 1/60) = 1/3 hours. 6 mph is the speed in miles per hour, so she ran 1/3 * 6 = 2 miles. So, she ran 2 miles.

Then, Ms. Warren walked at 2 mph for 30 minutes, which is 1/2 hours. 2 mph is the speed in miles per hour, so she walked 1/2 * 2 = 1 miles. So, she walked 1 mile.

In total, Ms. Warren ran 2 miles and walked 1 mile, so the total distance is 2 + 1 = 3 miles.
