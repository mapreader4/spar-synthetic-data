Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the cost of the video streaming subscription is $14 per month. If you're splitting the cost with your friend, that means you're splitting the cost 50/50.

The cost for the first year would be $14 per month. To find the total cost for the first year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12, since there are 12 months in a year.

$14 * 12 = 168

So, the total cost for the first year is $168.
