Let's break it down step by step.

Kristine drove a train for 300 km. So, she has traveled 300 km by train.

She then took a bus for half that distance. So, she has traveled 300 / 2 = 150 km by bus.

After that, she took a cab. She drove 3 times fewer kilometers than she rode the bus. The distance she rode the bus is 150 km, so she drove the cab for 150 - 3 * 50 = 150 - 150 = 150 - 150 = 0 km.

So, in total, Kristine has traveled 300 + 150 = 450 km.
