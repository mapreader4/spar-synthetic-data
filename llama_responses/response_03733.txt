Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the number of acres of good soil and clay-rich soil. Since one-third of Jorge's 60 acres is clay-rich soil, that means we can set up an equation to find the number of acres of clay-rich soil:

1/3 x 60 = x

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

3 x = 60

x = 20

So, Jorge has 20 acres of clay-rich soil. The rest of the land, which is 60 - 20 = 40 acres, is good soil.

Now, let's calculate the total yield from the good soil:

40 x 400 = 16000

Now, let's calculate the total yield from the clay-rich soil:

20 x 200 = 4000

Now, let's add the two yields together:

16000 + 4000 = 20800

So, Jorge's land yielded a total of 20800 bushels of corn.

Answer: 20800
