Let's start by using the information that Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker. Peter Parker's age is not given, but we can let's assume he is 1 year old. So Captain America is 7 times 1, which is 7 years old. Thor is 13 times older than Captain America, so Thor is 7 + 13 = 20 years old.

Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker. Peter Parker is 1 year old, so Ironman is 1 + 32 = 33 years old.

So, Ironman is 33 years old.
