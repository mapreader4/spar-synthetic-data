Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of fish in each of their aquariums.

Micah has 7 fish.
Kenneth has 3 times as many fish as Micah, so Kenneth has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
Matthias has 15 less fish than Kenneth, so Matthias has 21 - 15 = 6 fish.

Now, let's add the number of fish each of the boys has to get the total number of fish.

Micah has 7 fish.
Kenneth has 21 fish.
Matthias has 6 fish.

The boys have a total of 7 + 21 + 6 = 34 fish.

Answer: 34
