Let's break this down step by step.

1. The first child was born 15 years ago.
2. The second child was born one year after the first child, so the second child was born 14 years ago.
3. The third child was born on the fourth birthday of the second child, which means the second child was 4 years old at that time, so the third child was born 10 years ago.
4. Two years after the birth of the third child, the fourth child was born.

So, the fourth child was born 8 years ago.

Answer: 8
