Let's break this problem down step by step.

Mark had 10 pieces of fruit initially. He decides to keep 2 pieces for next week, so we subtract 2 from 10 to get the number of pieces of fruit he had left for this week:

10 - 2 = 8

So, Mark has 8 pieces of fruit left for this week.

He brings 3 pieces of fruit to school on the first day, so we subtract 3 from 8 to get the number of pieces of fruit he ate:

8 - 3 = 5

Mark ate 5 pieces of fruit in the first four days of the week.

Answer: 5
