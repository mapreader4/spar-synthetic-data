Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Steve has 2 boxes of pencils with 12 pencils in each box. So, Steve has a total of 2 x 12 = 24 pencils.

Step 2: He gave Matt 3 more pencils than he gave to Lauren. So, he gave Matt 3 pencils and gave Lauren 3 pencils. 

Step 3: Steve gave away 6 pencils to Lauren, which means he gave away 6 pencils in total. 

Step 4: Now, we need to subtract the number of pencils Steve gave away from the total number of pencils he had. 

24 - 6 = 18

Answer: 18
