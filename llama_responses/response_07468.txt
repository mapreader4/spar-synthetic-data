Let's break down the information given:

* The base price is $3.
* The cost for every mile is $4.
* Elise paid a total of $23.

Let's start by letting x be the distance from Elise's house to the hospital. The total cost can be calculated as:

Cost = Base price + (Distance * Cost per mile)

We know the base price is $3, so let's write that as 3. We know the total cost is $23, so let's subtract the base price to find the total distance:

23 - 3 = 20

Now, let's divide the total cost by the cost per mile:

20 รท 4 = 5

So, the distance from Elise's house to the hospital is 5 miles.
