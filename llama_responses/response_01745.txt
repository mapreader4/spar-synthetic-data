Let's start by finding out how much Agnes makes in a month. Since Agnes works 8 hours a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, she works 8 x 4 = 32 hours a month.

Now, we know that Agnes makes $15 an hour, so she makes 15 x 32 = $480 in a month.

Now, we want to find out how many hours Mila needs to work to earn as much as Agnes. We can set up an equation to represent this.

Let's let h be the number of hours Mila works in a month. We can set up the equation as follows:

15h = 480

We can solve for h by dividing both sides by 15:

h = 480 / 15
h = 32

So, Mila needs to work 32 hours in a month to earn as much as Agnes.
