Let's break down the costs:

* Two salads: 2 x $3 = $6
* 2 kilograms of beef: 2 kilograms x (2 x $3) = 2 x $6 = $12
* 1 kilogram of potatoes: $3 / 3 = $1
* Two liters of juice: 2 x $1.5 = $3

Now, let's add up the costs:

$6 + $12 + $1 + $3 = $22

So, Laura needs to pay $22 for all the products she bought.
