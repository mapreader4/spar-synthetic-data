Let's break this down step by step.

James initially weighs 120 kg.

He gains 20% of his body weight in muscle and 1 quarter that much in fat. To find the amount of weight he gains, we multiply his body weight by 20%: 120 kg x 0.2 = 24 kg (muscle) + 24 kg (fat).

He gains 24 kg of muscle and 6 kg of fat. So, he now weighs 120 kg + 24 kg + 6 kg = 130 kg.

Answer: 130
