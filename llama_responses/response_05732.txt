Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The first ten students scored 90 marks, so the average of those students is 90 marks.
2. The next 15 students scored 10 marks fewer than the first ten students, which means they scored 80 marks each (90 - 10 = 80).
3. The rest of the students scored 60 marks each. There are 50 - 10 = 40 students who scored 60 marks each.
4. To find the average marks for the whole class, we add up all the marks and divide by the number of students. So, we have: 90 + 15 * 80 + 40 * 60 = 90 + 1200 = 2100.
5. We divide 2100 by 50 students: 2100 / 50 = 42.

Answer: 42
