Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate Brendan's total income for the week.

Brendan makes $6/hour as a waiter, and he works 2 8-hour shifts and 1 12-hour shift. The total number of hours he works is:

2 x 8 + 1 x 12 = 16 hours

His total income is:

16 hours x $6/hour = $96

He also makes an average of $12 in tips each hour, so his total tips are:

16 hours x $12/hour = $192

His total income is the sum of his regular pay and his tips:

$96 + $192 = $288

Step 2: Calculate Brendan's taxes.

Brendan is supposed to pay 20% of his income in taxes. To calculate this, we need to multiply his total income by 0.20:

$288 x 0.20 = $57.60

Step 3: Calculate Brendan's reported tips.

Brendan is supposed to report 1/3rd of his tips to the IRS. To calculate this, we need to multiply his total tips by 0.33:

$192 x 0.33 = $63.36

Step 4: Calculate Brendan's total taxes.

Brendan's total taxes are the sum of his reported tips and his total income:

$57.60 + $63.36 = $120.96

Answer: $120.96
