Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of puppies Yuri adopted in each week.

In the first week, Yuri adopted 20 puppies.
In the second week, Yuri adopted 2/5 times as many puppies as the first week, which is 2 x 20 = 40 puppies.
In the third week, Yuri adopted twice the number of puppies as the second week, which is 2 x 40 = 80 puppies.
In the fourth week, Yuri adopted 10 more puppies than he adopted on the first week, which is 20 + 10 = 30 puppies.

Now, let's add up the number of puppies Yuri adopted in all the weeks.

20 + 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

So, Yuri has 150 puppies now.

Answer: 150
