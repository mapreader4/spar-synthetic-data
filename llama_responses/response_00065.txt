Let's break it down step by step:

1. Lee mowed one lawn and charges $33. So, he earned $33 from the one lawn.
2. Last week, he mowed 16 lawns. So, he mowed a total of 17 lawns (1 + 16).
3. Three customers each gave him a $10 tip. So, the total amount of tips is $30.
4. The total amount he earned is the sum of the amount he earned from the lawns he mowed and the tips he got. So, the total amount he earned is $33 + $30 = $63.

Answer: 63
