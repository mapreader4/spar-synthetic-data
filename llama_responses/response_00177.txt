Let's break this down step by step.

James sold his $20,000 car for 80% of its value, so the amount he got from the sale of the car is 0.8 x 20000 = $16,000.

The car he bought the new car for 90% of its value.  The value of the new car is $30,000, so the amount he paid for the car is 0.9 x 30000 = $27,000.

The amount James is out of pocket is the difference between the amount he got from selling his old car and the amount he paid for the new car.  This is $27,000 - $16,000 = $11,000.

Answer: 11000
