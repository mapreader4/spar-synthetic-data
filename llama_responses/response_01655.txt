Let's break down the given information step by step:

1. Abe's budget is $3000.
2. He spends a third of his budget on food, so that is (1/3) x 3000 = $1000.
3. He spends a quarter of his budget on restaurant supplies, so that is (1/4) x 3000 = $750.
4. The rest of his budget on employee wages, so that is 3000 - 1000 - 750 = $1250.

So, he is spending $1250 on employee wages.
