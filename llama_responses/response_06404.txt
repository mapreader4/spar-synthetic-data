Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find out how much money Jimmy has. He buys 2 candy bars for $.75 each, so that's a total of 2 x $.75 = $1.50. Then he buys 4 lollipops for $.25 each, so that's a total of 4 x $.25 = $1.00. So, Jimmy has a total of $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50. Then, he earned $1.50 from shoveling snow, and he spent it all. Let's say he shoveled x driveways. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 1.5 = 2.5x.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5 to get x by itself: x = 1.5 รท 1.5 = 1. So, Jimmy shoveled 1 driveway.
