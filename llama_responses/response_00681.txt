Let's break this problem down step by step.

Fernanda purchased 6 audiobooks, each 30 hours long, so the total number of hours of audiobooks is 6 * 30 = 180 hours.

She listened to 2 hours of an audiobook each day, so the total number of hours she listened to per day is 2.

To find the total time it took her to finish the 6 audiobooks, we need to divide the total number of hours of audiobooks (180) by the number of hours she listened to per day (2). 

180 รท 2 = 90

Answer: 90
