Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find out how much Dawn will earn for 1 painting.  If she earns $3,600.00 for 12 paintings, then for 1 painting, she will earn $3,600.00 / 12 = $300.00.

Then, if she takes 2 hours to paint 1 watercolor painting, then she earns $300.00 / 2 = $150.00 per hour.

So, the answer is: Answer: 150.
