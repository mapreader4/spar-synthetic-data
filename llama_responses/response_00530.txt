Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of desserts. There are 42 cookies and 63 pieces of candy. Since these are different types of desserts, we can add them together to get the total number of desserts. 42 + 63 = 105.

Since there are 7 people in Pat's family, and each person will get the same number of desserts, we need to divide the total number of desserts by 7.

105 รท 7 = 15.

So, each person will get 15 desserts.
