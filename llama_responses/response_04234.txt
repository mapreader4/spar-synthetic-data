Let's start by identifying the number of cats in King Henry's kingdom. If there are 75 hogs as many as cats, then we know that the number of cats is 75.

We need to find 5 less than 60% of the number of cats. 60% of 75 is 0.6 times 75, which is 45. So, 5 less than that is 45 - 5 = 40.

Answer: 40
