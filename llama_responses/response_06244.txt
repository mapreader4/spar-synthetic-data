Let's break down the total square footage of the house into its components:

* Master bedroom and bath: 500 sq ft
* 2 guest bedrooms: 2 x 200 = 400 sq ft
* Kitchen, guest bath, and living area: 600 sq ft

The total square footage of the house is the sum of these three parts:

500 + 400 + 600 = 1500 sq ft

Tony spends $3,000 a month on rent. To find out how much he is spending per sq ft, we need to divide the total rent by the total square footage:

$3,000 / 1500 sq ft = 2
