Let's break down the cost of the items Phil bought.

The slice of pizza cost $2.75, the soda cost $1.50, and the jeans cost $11.50.

The total cost of the items is $2.75 + $1.50 + $11.50 = $15.25.

Phil started with $40. After spending $15.25, he will have:

$40 - $15.25 = $24.75

He has $24.75 left.

Phil has $24.75, and he has quarters. Since $24.75 = 24 quarters.
