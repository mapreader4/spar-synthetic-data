Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the ring he bought is worth $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, so his wife's ring is worth $20,000.  He sells the first ring for half its value, which is $5,000.

He is out of pocket for the difference between the cost of the ring and the amount he got for it.  To find this out, we subtract the amount he got for the ring from the cost of the ring.  So, we have:

$10,000 (cost of the ring) - $5,000 (amount he got for the ring) = $5,000.

So, he is out of pocket for $5,000.
