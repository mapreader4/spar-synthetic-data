Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the number of lemons that a normal lemon tree produces in a year.  We are told that a normal lemon tree produces 60 lemons per year.  We are also told that Jim has specially engineered lemon trees that produce 50% more lemons per year.  So, the total number of lemons produced by Jim's lemon trees is 60 + 50 = 110 lemons per year.

Next, we need to find the total number of lemons that Jim's lemon trees produce in 5 years.  We know that the total number of lemons produced by Jim's lemon trees is 110 per year, and we want to find the total number of lemons produced in 5 years.  We can do this by multiplying the number of lemons produced per year by the number of years.  So, 110 lemons per year times 5 years is:

110 * 5 = 550 lemons.

Answer: 550
