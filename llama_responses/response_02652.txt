Let's think step by step.

Let's first calculate the total amount of money they have earned so far:

$10 x 3 = $30

$5 x 15 = $75

Total amount earned so far: $30 + $75 = $105

The goal is to collect $150. To find out how much more they need, we subtract the amount earned from the goal:

$150 - $105 = $45

So, they need $45 more to reach their goal.

Answer: 45
