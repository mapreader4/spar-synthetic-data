Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that James buys 20 toy cars. Since he buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, we can say that the number of toy soldiers is half of the number of toy cars.

Let's write this as an equation: 20 = 2x. Since the number of toy soldiers is half of the number of toy cars, we can divide 20 by 2 to get the number of toy soldiers. 20 / 2 = 10.

Answer: 10
