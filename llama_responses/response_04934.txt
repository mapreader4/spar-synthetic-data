Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the return on investment (ROI) for Emma. Emma's ROI is 15%, so if she invested $300, she will earn 15% of that, which is:

$300 * 0.15 = $45

So, Emma's ROI is $45.

Next, let's find the ROI for Briana. Briana's ROI is 10%, so if she invested $500, she will earn 10% of that, which is:

$500 * 0.10 = $50

So, Briana's ROI is $50.

Now, to find the difference between their ROIs, we need to subtract Emma's ROI from Briana's ROI:

$50 - $45 = $5

So, the difference between their return-on-investment after 2 years is $5.
