Let's break it down step by step:

1. The treadmill is being sold for a 30% discount. To find the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price. 30% of what is the original price? Well, if we call the original price x, then 0.3x is 30% of x. So, we can set up the equation 0.3x = 30. We can then solve for x, which is the original price of the treadmill.

0.3x = 30

x = 1500

So, the original price of the treadmill is $1500.

2. The 2 pieces of 45-pound plates are each $50 each. We need to multiply the number of plates by the price of each plate to find the total cost of the plates.

2 x 50 = 100

So, the total cost of the plates is $100.

3. Now, we need to find the total cost of the treadmill and the plates. We add the cost of the treadmill to the cost of the plates.

1500 + 100 = 1600

So, Andre paid a total of $1600.
