Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of pieces of bread Sally eats on Saturday. She eats 2 sandwiches, and each sandwich uses 2 pieces of bread. So, she eats 2 * 2 = 4 pieces of bread on Saturday.

Then, she eats 1 sandwich on Sunday, which also uses 2 pieces of bread. So, she eats 1 * 2 = 2 more pieces of bread on Sunday.

In total, Sally eats 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of bread. The answer is:

Answer: 6
