Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Mike needs at least 40 bricks of type A, and half that many of type B. Let's say the number of type B bricks is x. Since he needs half of the number of type B bricks as the number of type A bricks, we can write the equation as 40 = 0.5x.

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get 80 = x. So, x = 80.

Now, we know that the total number of bricks needed is 150, and the number of type A bricks is 40, and the number of type B bricks is 80. To find the number of bricks of other types, we can subtract the number of type A bricks and type B bricks from the total number of bricks.

The number of other types of bricks is 150 - (40 + 80) = 30.

Answer: 30
