Let's start by using the information given: Samantha had 5 more bands than Aira and Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of bands that Aira had. Let's call it x.

Since Samantha had 5 more bands than Aira, we can say that Samantha had x + 5 bands. And since Aira and Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe, we can say that Aira and Aira had x - 1 bands.

We know that Samantha, Aira, and Joe received 6 rubber bands each after dividing their bands equally. So, the total number of bands is 6 * 3 = 18.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x - 1) + (x + 5) = 18

We can solve this equation by adding all the terms on the left side and then dividing both sides by 2:

2x + 2x - 1 + 5 = 18

Combine like terms: 2x + 2x = 4x - 1 + 5

Combine the constant terms: 4x - 1 + 5 = 4x + 4 + 1

Subtract 4 from both sides: 4x + 4 = 18 - 1

Divide both sides by 4: x = 18 / 4 - 1 / 4

x = 4.5

So, Aira had 4.5 rubber bands.
