Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Pete has to take a 10-minute walk down to the train station.
2. After that, he has to take a 1hr 20-minute train to LA.
3. The total time for the walk and the train ride is 10 minutes + 1hr 20 minutes = 1hr 10 minutes.
4. Since he cannot get to LA later than 0900 hours, Pete has to leave at 0900 hours.

So, the time for Pete to leave is 0900 hours.
