Let's break this down step by step.

1. Carrie adds 12 oz cans of Mountain Dew. There are 12 oz in 1 can. So, she has 12 oz of Mountain Dew.

2. She adds 28 oz of ice. This is an additional 28 oz, so now she has a total of 12 oz of Mountain Dew + 28 oz of ice, which is 40 oz.

3. She adds a 40 oz bottle of fruit juice. This is an additional 40 oz, so now she has 40 oz of Mountain Dew, 28 oz of ice, and 40 oz of fruit juice. That's a total of 88 oz.

4. To find the number of 10 oz servings, we need to divide the total amount of punch by 10 oz. 88 oz / 10 oz = 8.8. So, Carrie has 8.8 servings of punch.

Answer: 8
