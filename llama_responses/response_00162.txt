Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the cost of the 80 games that Daniel bought for $12 each.

80 * 12 = 960

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 50 games that Daniel bought for $7.

50 * 7 = 350

The total cost of these two types of games is:

960 + 350 = 1310

Now, let's calculate the cost of the remaining games that had a price of $3 each.

The total number of these games is 346 - 80 - 50 = 196.

196 * 3 = 588

So, the total cost of all the games in Daniel's collection is:

1310 + 588 = 1898

Answer: 1898
