Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by letting x be the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate.

Mike says that Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that he ate, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

Jenny ate 5 + 3x

We know that Mike ate 20 chocolate squares, so we can substitute 20 for x:

20 = 3x + 5

We can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:

15 = 3x

We can then divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get:

5 = x

So, Jenny ate 5 chocolate squares.
