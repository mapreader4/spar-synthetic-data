Let's start by calculating the reduced price of the cereal box. The price is reduced by $24 from the original price of $104, so the new price is $104 - $24 = $80.

Next, we need to multiply the new price by the number of boxes purchased. Romina bought 20 boxes, so the total price is $80 x 20 = $1600.

Answer: 1600
