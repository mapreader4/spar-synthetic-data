Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate the number of hours Isabella has babysat.

Isabella babysits 5 hours every day, 6 afternoons a week. There are 7 days in a week. So, the number of hours Isabella has babysat is:

5 hours/day * 7 days = 35 hours

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Isabella has earned.

Isabella earns $5 an hour. So, to calculate the total amount of money Isabella has earned, we multiply the number of hours she has babysat by the rate she earns per hour:

35 hours * $5/hour = $175

So, the answer is:

Answer: 175
