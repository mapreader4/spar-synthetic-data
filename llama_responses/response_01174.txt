Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of blue butterflies be x.

Martha has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies, so if she has 5 black butterflies, then she has x + 5 blue butterflies.

We know that the total number of butterflies is 11, so we can set up an equation to solve for x.

x + 5 + x = 11

We can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 11 - 5

x = 6

So Martha has 6 blue butterflies.
