Let's break this problem down step by step.

Darius has 5 buckets of water. Each bucket contains a different amount of ounces. The information given is:

* 1st bucket: 11 ounces
* 2nd bucket: 13 ounces
* 3rd bucket: 12 ounces
* 4th bucket: 16 ounces
* 5th bucket: 10 ounces

He pours the 10-ounce bucket into the bigger bucket, along with one of the other four. The bigger bucket now has 23 ounces.

He pours the remaining three buckets into the second large bucket. These buckets are:

* 1st bucket: 11 ounces
* 2nd bucket: 13 ounces
* 3rd bucket: 12 ounces

He pours the 11-ounce bucket, 13-ounce bucket, and 12-ounce bucket into the second big bucket. So, the total ounces in the second large bucket is:

11 + 13 + 12 = 36

The second large bucket contains 36 ounces.
