Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that John gets $30 from his grandpa and 3 times that much from his grandma. So, we can set up an equation:

30 + 3x =?

We are trying to find the value of x. We know that John got 30 dollars from his grandpa, and 3 times that much from his grandma. So, we can write:

30 + 3x = 30

To solve for x, we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to get:

3x = 0

So, x is 0.
