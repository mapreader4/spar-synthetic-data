Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* A bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips in it.
* A batch of cookies has 9 chocolate chips in it.
* There are three batches of cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of chocolate chips in each batch by the number of batches.

9 chocolate chips per batch * 3 batches = 27 chocolate chips in total per batch

But we want to find the total number of cookies, not chocolate chips. Since each cookie has 9 chocolate chips, we need to divide the total chocolate chips by 9.

27 chocolate chips / 9 = 3

Answer: 3
