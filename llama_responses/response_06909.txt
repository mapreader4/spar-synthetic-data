Let's start by identifying the number of chairs that can be made in 1 day by 1 carpenter. We know that 8 carpenters can make 50 chairs in 10 days, so the number of chairs made by 1 carpenter in 1 day can be calculated as follows:

50 chairs in 10 days = 50 / 10 = 5 chairs in 1 day

Now, we know that 1 carpenter can make 5 chairs in 1 day, so to find the number of carpenters needed to make 75 chairs in 10 days, we can multiply the number of chairs made in 1 day by the number of days:

5 chairs in 1 day * 10 days = 50 chairs

To find the number of carpenters needed, we can divide the total number of chairs by the number of chairs made in 1 day:

75 chairs / 50 chairs in 1 day = 1.5 carpenters

So, the answer is:

Answer: 1.5
