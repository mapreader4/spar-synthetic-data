Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Jim's gas tank is 12 gallons.
* He has 2/3 of a tank left after he drives to and from work.
* The distance he drives to and from work is 10 miles.

To find the total distance Jim drives, we multiply the distance to and from work by 2, since he drives there and back:

10 miles * 2 = 20 miles

Now, we know that Jim has 2/3 of a tank left. To find the amount of gas used, we can multiply the total distance by 2/3:

20 miles * 2/3 = 13.33 miles

Since Jim's gas tank is 12 gallons, we can set up a proportion to find the miles per gallon:

13.33 miles / 12 gallons = x miles/gallon

To simplify this fraction, we can convert it to a decimal by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 0.5:

13.33 รท 0.5 = 26.66

So, Jim gets approximately 26.66 miles per gallon.
