Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how much Reginald earned. He earns $1.25 for each apple. Let's call the number of apples he sold x. Then, his total earnings will be 1.25x.

He plans to use his profits to help repair his bike. The bike cost $80. The repairs cost 25% of what his bike cost, which is 0.25 * 80 = 20. So, he needs 20 dollars to repair his bike.

After the repairs are paid for, 1/5 of the money he'd earned remains. Let's find out how much he earned in total. He earned 1.25x, and 1/5 of that is 0.2x. We know that 0.2x is equal to 20, so we can set up an equation: 1.25x = 20 + 20. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 1.25x = 40. Multiplying both sides by 4, we get 5x = 160.

So, Reginald sold 160 apples.
