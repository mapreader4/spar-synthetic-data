Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the number of viewers Voltaire has per day. Voltaire has 50 viewers per day.

Step 2: Since Leila has twice the number of viewers Voltaire has, we can multiply 50 by 2 to find the number of viewers Leila has. 50 x 2 = 100.

Step 3: Now we need to find out how much Leila earns per day. Since she earns $0.50 per view, we can multiply 100 (the number of viewers Leila has) by $0.50 (the amount she earns per view). 100 x $0.50 = $50.

Step 4: To find out how much Leila earns per week, we need to multiply the amount she earns per day by 7 (the number of days in a week). $50 x 7 = $350.

Answer: 350
