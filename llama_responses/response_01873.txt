Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Jeremy's current age is x.

Since Sebastian is 4 years older than Jeremy, we know that Sebastian's current age is x + 4.

The total sum of their ages in three years will be 150.

So, the sum of their ages in three years is x + 4 + x + x + x = 150.

The sum of their ages now is x + x + x.

So, we know that the sum of their ages now is 40 + 40 + x.

We can rewrite this equation as 80 + x.

Since 80 + x = 150, we know that x = 70.

So, Sophia's age in three years is 70 - 3 = 67.

Answer: 67
