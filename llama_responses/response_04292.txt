Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many fish Jordan caught. Jordan caught 4 fish.

Perry caught double what Jordan caught, so Perry caught 4 * 2 = 8 fish.

The total number of fish they caught is 4 + 8 = 12.

On the way back to shore, they lost one-fourth of their total catch. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, they lost 3 fish.

To find the number of fish that remain, we subtract the number of fish they lost from the total number of fish they caught: 12 - 3 = 9.
