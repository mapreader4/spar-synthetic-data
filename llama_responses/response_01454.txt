Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of miles Tom drives per week. He drives 50 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Sunday, which is 3 days, and 100 miles on the other 4 days, which is 100 * 4 = 400 miles. So, the total number of miles he drives per week is 50 + 50 + 50 + 100 + 100 = 300 miles.

2. Next, let's find the total cost per week. Tom has to pay $.1 per mile, and he drives 300 miles per week. So, the total cost per week is 300 *.1 = 30.

3. He also has to pay a weekly fee of $100. So, the total amount he has to pay per week is 30 + 100 = 130.

4. Since Tom has to pay this amount every week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, the total amount he has to pay in a year is 130 * 52 = 6760.

Answer: 6760
