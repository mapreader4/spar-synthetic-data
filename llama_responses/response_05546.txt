Let's start by identifying the total amount of money Shelly has in terms of $10 bills. She has ten $10 bills. Each $10 bill is worth 10 dollars, so the total amount in $10 bills is 10 * 10 = 100 dollars. Then, she has four $5 bills. Each $5 bill is worth 5 dollars, so the total amount in $5 bills is 4 * 5 = 20 dollars. To find the total amount of money Shelly has, we add the total in $10 bills and $5 bills together. 100 + 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 120
