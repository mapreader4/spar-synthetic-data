Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the amount of money Marlon spent on Monday. We know that he spent half of the $200 gift card on Monday, which means he spent $100.

Next, we know that he spent one-fourth of the remainder on Tuesday. The remainder is the amount left after spending $100, so the remainder is $100 - $100 = $100. Therefore, the remainder is $100.

Now, we can find the amount left on his gift card by subtracting the amount he spent on Tuesday from the original amount. So, we get:

$200 - $100 = $100

Answer: $100
