Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the temperature after 3 hours. Since the temperature rises by 8 degrees per hour, we can multiply 8 degrees by 3 hours to get:

8 degrees/hour x 3 hours = 24 degrees

So, the temperature after 3 hours is 24 degrees higher than the initial temperature. Let's assume the initial temperature is x degrees. Then, the temperature after 3 hours is:

x + 24 degrees

Next, we need to find the temperature after the air conditioner is turned on. The air conditioner lowers the temperature at a rate of 4 degrees per hour. Since we want to find the time it takes to restore the warehouse to 43 degrees F, we can set up the following equation:

x + 24 - 4t = 43

where t is the time in hours that the air conditioner is turned on.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 24 - 4t = 43

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

24 - 4t = 20

Dividing both sides by -4 gives:

t = 1 hour

So, it will take 1 hour for the air conditioner to restore the warehouse to 43 degrees F.
