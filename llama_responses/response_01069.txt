Let's first find the value of the coins that Maria has. There are 4 dimes, each worth 10 cents, so that is 40 cents. There are 4 quarters, each worth 25 cents, so that is 100 cents. There are 7 nickels, each worth 5 cents, so that is 35 cents. In total, Maria has 40 cents + 100 cents + 35 cents = 175 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, Maria has 1.75 dollars. The mom gives her 5 quarters, each worth 25 cents, so Maria now has 1.75 dollars + 1.25 dollars = 2.00 dollars. Answer: 2.
