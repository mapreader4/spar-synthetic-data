Let's break it down step by step:

1. Paul has 2 hours of homework on weeknights and 5 hours for the weekend, so he has a total of 7 hours of homework in a week.
2. Since he has 3 nights left to do homework, and 2 nights are already taken up by going out, that means he has 3 nights left for doing homework.
3. For 3 nights, he needs to do 7 hours of homework. 7 hours divided by 3 nights is 2.33 hours per night.
4. So, the answer is: Answer: 2.33.
