Let's start by calculating the total number of hotdogs the children wanted. Ella and Emma wanted 2 hotdogs each, so that's a total of 2 + 2 = 4 hotdogs. Luke said he could eat twice as much as his sisters, so he would eat 2 x 2 = 4 hotdogs. Hunter said he could eat half as much as his sisters, so he would eat 4 / 2 = 2 hotdogs. 

Now, we need to add up the total number of hotdogs the boys wanted to eat. 4 + 4 + 2 = 10. Matthew needed to cook 10 hotdogs for dinner. 

Answer: 10
