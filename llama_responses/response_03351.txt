Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The distance to the church is 20 miles.
2. The horse can go 10 miles per hour.
3. The cost per hour is $30, and the flat fee is $20.
4. The total distance is 20 miles.  20 miles / 10 miles per hour = 2 hours.
5. The cost per hour is $30, and the flat fee is $20.  The total cost would be 2 hours * $30 + $20 = $70.
