Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits initially present in the region. There are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits.

Now, each fox catches an average of 4 weasels and 2 rabbits per week. So, in 3 weeks, the total number of weasels caught will be 3 x 4 = 12, and the total number of rabbits caught will be 3 x 2 = 6.

So, the total number of weasels caught in 3 weeks is 12, and the total number of rabbits caught is 6.

The remaining number of weasels is 100 - 12 = 88, and the remaining number of rabbits is 50 - 6 = 44.

So, the answer is: Answer: 44
