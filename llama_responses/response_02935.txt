Let's think step by step.

Edward has $17.80 to spend at the toy store. He buys 4 toy cars that cost $0.95 each, so he spends 4 x $0.95 = $3.80 on the toy cars. Then, he buys a race track that costs $6.00. So, the total amount he spent is $3.80 + $6.00 = $9.80.

Edward started with $17.80, and he spent $9.80, so to find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had:

$17.80 - $9.80 = $8.00

So, Edward has $8.00 left to buy more toys.
