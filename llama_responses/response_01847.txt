Let's break it down step by step.

Martha had 4 bottles of juice in the refrigerator and 4 bottles in the pantry, so initially, she had a total of 8 bottles of juice.

She bought 5 more bottles of juice during the week, so she now has a total of 8 + 5 = 13 bottles of juice.

Martha and her family drank 3 bottles of juice during the week, so she has 13 - 3 = 10 bottles of juice left.
