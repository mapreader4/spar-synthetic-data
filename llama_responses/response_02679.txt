Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the total score of the three people.

Gretchen bowled a 120, so her score is 120.
Mitzi bowled a 113, so her score is 113.
Beth bowled an 85, so her score is 85.

Now, to find the average score, we need to add up all three scores and then divide by 3.

120 + 113 + 85 = 318

Now, we divide the sum by 3:

318 / 3 = 106

Answer: 106
