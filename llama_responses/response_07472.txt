Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the current age difference between Anika and Maddie.

Anika is 30 and Maddie is 30 + 4 = 34.

So, the age difference is 34 - 30 = 4.

In 15 years, their ages will be 30 + 15 = 45.

So, the average age in 15 years will be (30 + 15) / 2 = 45 / 2 = 22.5.

Answer: 22.5
