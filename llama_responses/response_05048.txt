Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that Jessie won 3 times as many athletic awards as his buddy Scott, who won 4 awards. So Jessie won 3 x 4 = 12 awards.

The best athlete at the rival high school won twice as many awards as Jessie. We know that the best athlete won 2 times Jessie's number of awards, which is 12. So the rival won 2 x 12 = 24 awards.

So the answer is: Answer: 24
