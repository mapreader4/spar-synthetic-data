Let's break it down step by step.

Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class, which is 18 hours. She spends 4 hours per day working on homework. So, in a week, she works on homework for 4 * 7 = 28 hours.

She spends 8 hours per day sleeping. So, in a week, she sleeps for 8 * 7 = 56 hours.

She works part-time 20 hours per week. So, she works 20 hours.

To find the hours left over, we subtract the hours she works on homework and the hours she sleeps from the total hours she has in a week. So, we have:

28 (homework) - 56 (sleeping) = 28 - 56 = 8

Answer: 8
