To find the area of the chalkboard, we need to find the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L * W, where A is the area and L and W are the length and width of the rectangle respectively.

The length of the chalkboard is given as 3 feet, and it is 2 times as long as it is wide. So, the width of the chalkboard is also 3 feet. Therefore, the area of the chalkboard is given by A = L * W = 3 * 3 = 9.
