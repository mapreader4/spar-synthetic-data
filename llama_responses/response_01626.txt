Let's think step by step.

Ali has 7 bills of 5 dollars, so he has a total of 7 x 5 = 35 dollars.
He also has 1 bill of 10 dollars, so he has an additional 10 dollars.

To find the total amount of money Ali has, we add 35 dollars and 10 dollars. So, the total amount is 35 + 10 = 45 dollars.

Answer: 45
