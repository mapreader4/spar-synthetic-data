Let's break this down step by step.

1. The alligator is 1.4 meters long, which is 140 centimeters long. The alligator is 50 centimeters long, which is 50 centimeters long. The ratio of the length of the alligator to the length of the snake is 50/140.

2. The alligator eats one alligator per week, and the snake eats 50-centimeter-long alligators at a constant rate. This means that the snake eats 1/7 of a 50-centimeter-long alligator per week.

3. The snake will eat 616 days. In this time, the snake will eat 616/7 = 88 alligators.

4. The snake can eat 88 alligators.

Answer: 88
