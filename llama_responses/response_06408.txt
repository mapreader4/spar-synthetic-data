Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say that the amount of time Annie spent building the diorama is equal to three times the amount of time she spent planning it minus 5 minutes. Let's call the amount of time she spent planning it x.

So, the equation is: 3x - 5 = 67.

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get: 3x = 72.

Then, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 24.

So, Annie spent 24 minutes planning the diorama.

Answer: 24
