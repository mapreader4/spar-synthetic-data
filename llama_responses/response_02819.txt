Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Brian read one book with 20 chapters.
* He read two books with 15 chapters each.
* One book has half the chapters of the three previous books.

Let's denote the number of chapters in the first book as A, the number of chapters in the two books as B, and the number of chapters in the third book as C. We know that A is 20, B is 15, and C is half of A + B.

So, C is (A + B)/2, which is (20 + 15)/2 = 35/2 = 17.5. Since C is an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer, which is 18.

Brian read 20 + 2 x 15 + 18 = 20 + 30 + 18 = 68.

Answer: 68
