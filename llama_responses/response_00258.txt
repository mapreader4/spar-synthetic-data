Let's start by using the information that Anne is 80cm tall. We know that Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne, so Bella's height is 80 * 3 = 240cm.

Now, we need to find the height of Anne's sister. We know that Anne is 80cm tall and Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne, so Anne's sister is 80 / 3 = 26.67cm.

The difference between Bella and Anne's sister is 240 - 26.67 = 213.33cm.

Answer: 213
