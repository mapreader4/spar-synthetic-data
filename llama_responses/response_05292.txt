Let's break this down step by step.

Rachelle threw 180 pennies into the fountain.

Gretchen threw half as many pennies as Rachelle, which is 180 / 2 = 90 pennies.

Rocky threw in one-third as many pennies as Gretchen, which is 90 / 3 = 30 pennies.

To find the total number of pennies thrown into the fountain, we add the number of pennies thrown by each person:

180 (Rachelle) + 90 (Gretchen) + 30 (Rocky) = 300

Answer: 300
