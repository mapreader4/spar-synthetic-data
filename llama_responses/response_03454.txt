Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the initial number of students: 8 students were initially enrolled.

Then, 8 more became interested but a quarter of them dropped out, which means 8/4 = 2 students dropped out.

Then, 2 more students got frustrated and left, leaving 8 - 2 = 6 students.

The class then rallied to show how simple the course actually is and increased enrollment by 5 times the amount of students already enrolled in the class, which is 6 * 5 = 30 students. However, 2 had to drop it because of scheduling conflicts, leaving 30 - 2 = 28 students.

After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled, so now there are 28 + 6 = 34 students.

As the days passed, half of the class eventually dropped, which is 34/2 = 17 students. And half of the remaining students graduated, which is 17/2 = 8.5, rounded down to 8 students.

So, the number of students still enrolled is 34 - 17 = 17 students, then 17 - 8 = 9 students.

Answer: 9
