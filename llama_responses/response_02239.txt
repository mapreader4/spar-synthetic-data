Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many oranges Frank picked. Betty picked 15 oranges and Bill picked 12 oranges. Together, they picked 15 + 12 = 27 oranges. Frank picked three times that amount, which is 3 x 27 = 81.

Frank then planted 2 seeds from each of his 81 oranges, so he planted 2 x 81 = 162 seeds. He waited 20 years for each seed to turn into a tree, so he has 162 trees.

Each tree contains 5 oranges, so the total number of oranges is 162 x 5 = 810.

Answer: 810
