Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Mark wins 70% of the votes in the first area, which has 100,000 voters.
* Mark gets twice as many votes in the remaining area.

To find the total number of votes Mark got, we need to calculate 70% of the votes in the first area and then multiply it by 2.

70% of 100,000 is 0.7 * 100,000 = 70,000.
70,000 * 2 = 140,000.

Answer: 140,000
