Let's break this problem down step by step.

On the first day, Eric counts 50 oysters and 72 crabs.

On the second day, he finds that only half the number of oysters are on the rocks, which means there are 50/2 = 25 oysters on the rocks.

He also finds that only 2/3 the number of crabs are on the beach, which means there are 72 * 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach.

To find the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in two days, we add the numbers from both days:

50 (oysters on the first day) + 25 (oysters on the second day) + 72 (crabs on the first day) + 48 (crabs on the second day) = 195

Answer: 195
