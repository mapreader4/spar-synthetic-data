Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Calvin had scored 500 points.
* Paislee scored 3/4 times as many points as Calvin.

To find the points Paislee needed to achieve to have a chance of tying the game, we need to multiply Calvin's points by 4/3 to get Paislee's points.

500 x (4/3) =?

To calculate this, we can multiply 500 by 4 and then divide the result by 3.

500 x 4 = 2000
2000 รท 3 = 666.67

So, Paislee needed at least 667 points to have a chance of tying the game.
