Let's break this down step by step.

John bought 2 notebooks for each of his 3 children. So, he bought a total of 2 x 3 = 6 notebooks.

John's wife bought 5 notebooks for each of his 3 children. So, she bought a total of 5 x 3 = 15 notebooks.

To find the total number of notebooks they bought in total, we add the number of notebooks John bought to the number of notebooks his wife bought: 6 + 15 = 21.

Answer: 21
