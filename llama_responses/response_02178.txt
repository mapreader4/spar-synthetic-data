To find the value of the lawnmower after 6 months, we need to calculate the value after 25% decrease. The original value is 100 dollars. 25% of 100 is 0.25 x 100 = 25. So, the value after 6 months is 100 - 25 = 75.

Over the next year, the value of the mower dropped another 20%. So, we need to find 20% of 75. 0.2 x 75 = 15. So, the value after another 20% decrease is 75 - 15 = 60.

Answer: 60
