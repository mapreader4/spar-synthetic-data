Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Kylie picked x apples. Since Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount Kylie picked, so Kayla picked 4x + 10 apples.

The total amount of apples they picked is 340. We can set up an equation to solve for x:

x + (4x + 10) = 340

We can solve for x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

x + 4x = 330

Then, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 330 / 4
x = 82.5

So Kylie picked 82 apples, and Kayla picked 82 + 10 = 92 apples.

Answer: 92
