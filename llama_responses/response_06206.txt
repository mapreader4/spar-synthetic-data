Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Eman agreed to pay for the computer chair, which costs $100.

Next, Frank agreed to pay for the computer table, which costs $140.

Then, Frank agreed to pay 1/4 of the price of the joystick, which is $20. So Frank will pay $5 for the joystick (1/4 of $20). The remaining amount of $15 will be paid by Eman.

To find out how much more Frank will spend than Eman, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each sibling.

Frank will pay $140 for the computer table and $5 for the joystick, so his total amount spent is $145.

Eman will pay $100 for the computer chair and $15 for the joystick, so her total amount spent is $115.

To find out how much more Frank will spend than Eman, we subtract Eman's total amount spent from Frank's total amount spent:

$145 (Frank) - $115 (Eman) = $30

Answer: 30
