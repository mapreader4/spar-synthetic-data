Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the weight of one of Trace's shopping bags is x pounds.

Since Trace has five shopping bags that weigh the same amount, it means that each of his bags weigh the same amount, which is x pounds.

We know that the total weight of Gordon's two shopping bags is the same as the total weight of Trace's five shopping bags. So, we can set up the equation:

Gordon's two bags weigh 3 + 7 pounds = Trace's five bags weigh x pounds

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:

3 + 7 = 10

So, the total weight of Gordon's bags is 10 pounds.

Now, we know that the total weight of Gordon's bags is the same as the total weight of Trace's bags. So, we can set up the equation:

10 = 5x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

10 / 5 = x

x = 2
