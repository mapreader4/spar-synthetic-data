Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many hats John will wear in total.  He will wear a different hat every day for 2 weeks, so that is 14 days.  Since he will wear 1 hat per day, we can multiply 1 x 14 to get the total number of hats he will wear.  This is 14 hats.

Now, the cost of 14 hats will be 14 x $50.  So, the answer is:

Answer: 700
