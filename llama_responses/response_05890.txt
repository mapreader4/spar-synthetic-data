To find the number of miles Laura drives per week, we need to multiply the number of times she drives to the supermarket per week by the total distance of the round trip to the supermarket.

Laura drives to school in the morning and afternoon, so she drives a total of 2 times a week. The supermarket is 10 miles away from the school, so the total distance of the round trip is 20 miles.

The total distance of the round trip is 20 miles. Laura drives 2 times a week, so the total distance she drives is 2 * 20 = 40 miles.

So, the answer is: Answer: 40
