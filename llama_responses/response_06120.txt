Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of students who like the color blue. 30% of the total 200 students like the color blue, which is 0.3 * 200 = 60.

Next, let's find the number of students who like the color red. 40% of the remaining students who don't like the color blue, which is 100 - 30 = 70, like the color red. Since there are 200 - 60 = 140 students who don't like the color blue, and 40% of them like the color red, we have 0.4 * 140 = 56 students who like the color red.

Now, let's find the number of students who like the color yellow. We know that the number of students who like the color blue is 60, and the number of students who like the color red is 56. So, the number of students who like the color yellow and the color blue is the total of these two numbers, which is 60 + 56 = 116.

Answer: 116
