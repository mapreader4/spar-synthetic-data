Let's break this down step by step.

The PTA had $400 set aside initially.

They spent a fourth of that amount on school supplies, which is $100.

So, they had $400 - $100 = $300 left.

Then, they spent half of what was left on food for the faculty, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

So, they spent $150 on food.

Now, they have $300 - $150 = $150 left.

Answer: 150
