Let's start by identifying the pattern of Brianne's savings. Since she saves twice as much each month as she saved the previous month, she will save $10 x 2 = $20 in January, $20 x 2 = $40 in February, $40 x 2 = $80 in March, $80 x 2 = $160 in April, and so on. The pattern is to multiply the previous month's savings by 2. So, in May, Brianne will save $160 x 2 = $320. Answer: 320
