Let's start by identifying the number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah received in a day. Sophie received 20 oranges and Hannah received 40 grapes every day. So, the number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah received in a day is 20 + 40 = 60. 

Now, we need to multiply this number by 30 to get the total number of fruits that they received in 30 days. 60 * 30 = 1800. 

So, the answer is:

Answer: 1800
