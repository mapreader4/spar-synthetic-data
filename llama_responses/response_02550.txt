Let's think step by step!

Let's start by identifying the given information: Nancy earns $28 for working 4 hours. So, her hourly wage is $28 รท 4 = $7 per hour.

To find out how many hours Nancy has to work to earn $70, we can set up an equation: 7 * x = 70.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7: x = 70 รท 7 = 10.

So, Nancy has to work 10 hours to earn $70.
