Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of gilled mushrooms is x.

Since there is one gilled mushroom for every nine spotted mushrooms that grow, we can write an equation to represent the number of gilled mushrooms in terms of the number of spotted mushrooms:

x = 1/9 * (number of spotted mushrooms)

We know that there are 30 mushrooms growing on the fallen log, and we know that there are both spotted and gilled mushrooms. Since the problem states that the gilled mushrooms are rare, we can say that the number of spotted mushrooms must be at least 9, since it takes 9 spotted mushrooms for every 1 gilled mushroom. So, the number of spotted mushrooms is 9k, where k is a whole number.

We can substitute this value into our equation:

x = 1/9 * 9k

To solve for k, we can multiply both sides by 9:

k = 30 / 1/9

k = 30 * 9

k = 270

So, the value of k is 270. Therefore, the number of spotted mushrooms is 9 * 30 = 270.

Answer: 270
