Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of coins the pirate has: 3500 gold coins.

The pirate wants to put 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver coins. Since there are 500 silver coins, there will be 1000 bronze coins (500 * 2). So, the total number of bronze coins is 1500.

Now, the total number of coins is the sum of gold coins, silver coins, and bronze coins: 3500 (gold) + 500 (silver) + 1500 (bronze) = 5100.

The pirate wants to distribute these coins equally across 5 chests. To find the number of coins in each chest, we can divide the total number of coins by 5: 5100 รท 5 = 1020.

So, each chest will have 1020 coins.
