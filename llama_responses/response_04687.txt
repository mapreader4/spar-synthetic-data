Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The bus leaves at 8:00 a.m. and Delaney needs 30 minutes to reach the pick-up point from his home.
2. So, the pick-up point is 30 minutes before the bus leaves, which would be 7:30 a.m.
3. Delaney woke up late and left his home at 7:50 a.m.
4. To find out how much time he missed the bus by, we need to subtract the time he left his home from the pick-up time: 7:30 - 7:50 = 20 minutes.

Answer: 20
