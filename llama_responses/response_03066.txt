Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Martin had x fruits initially.

After eating half of the fruits, he is left with x/2 fruits.

He has 50 oranges now, which is twice as many as the limes, so we can set up the equation:

50 = 2 * limes

So, the number of limes is 25.

Now, since Martin had twice as many oranges as limes, he must have 50 oranges initially, as 50 is twice 25.

Answer: 50
