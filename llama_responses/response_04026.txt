Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars. We are also given that Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, so Mr. Phung has 56 + 16 = 72 silver dollars. Then, Mr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung, so Mr. Ha has 72 + 5 = 77 silver dollars.

Now, we can find the total number of silver dollars the three have by adding the number of silver dollars each has: 56 + 72 + 77 = 205.

Answer: 205
