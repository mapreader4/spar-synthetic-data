Let's break down the cost of the items Albert wants to buy:

1. Paintbrush: $1.50
2. Set of paints: $4.35
3. Wooden easel: $12.65

Total cost: $1.50 + $4.35 + $12.65 = $18.50

Albert has $6.50. To find out how much more money Albert needs, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount he has:

$18.50 - $6.50 = $11.00

So, Albert needs $11.00 more money.
