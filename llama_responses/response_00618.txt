To solve this problem, we will first find the probability that Jack gets bitten by an infected mosquito. The probability of getting bitten by an infected mosquito is 40% + 20% = 60%. Then, the probability of getting infected with Zika virus is 50% after getting bitten by an infected mosquito. However, the experimental vaccine reduces the chances of getting infected by 50%. So, the new probability of getting infected with Zika virus after getting bitten by an infected mosquito is 25%. The probability of getting infected with malaria is 50% after getting bitten by an infected mosquito. The probability of getting infected with malaria is not affected by the vaccine, so it is still 50%. The probability of getting infected with malaria is independent of the probability of getting infected with Zika virus. The probability of getting infected with malaria after getting bitten by an infected mosquito is 50%. Therefore, the probability of catching either Zika virus or malaria is the sum of the probability of getting infected with Zika virus and the probability of getting infected with malaria. So, the probability of catching either Zika virus or malaria is 60% * 25% + 50% = 60% + 50% = 110%. The answer is:

Answer: 110
