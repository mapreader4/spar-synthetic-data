Let's break this down step by step.

Let's find the time it takes Mary to slide down the 630 feet long hill. We know that the speed is 90 feet per minute, so we can find the time by dividing 630 by 90. 630 / 90 = 7 minutes.

Now, let's find the time it takes Ann to slide down the 800 feet long hill. We know that the speed is 40 feet per minute, so we can find the time by dividing 800 by 40. 800 / 40 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can compare the times. Mary takes 7 minutes, and Ann takes 20 minutes. Since 20 is greater than 7, we know that Ann's trip takes longer than Mary's trip. So, the answer is:

Answer: 13 minutes
