Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the rate at which the tree grows. The tree grows twice as fast as the boy, so if the boy grows 1 inch in 24 inches, the tree will grow 2 inches. Let's call the number of inches the tree grows in 24 inches x. So, the tree grows 2x inches in 24 inches.

The tree grows 2x inches in 24 inches, so it will grow 2x inches in 36 inches. We know that 2x = 12, since the tree grows twice as fast as the boy. So, the tree will grow 12 inches in 36 inches.

The tree is currently 16 inches tall, and it will grow 12 inches. So, the tree will be 16 + 12 = 28 inches tall by the time the boy is 36 inches tall.

Answer: 28
