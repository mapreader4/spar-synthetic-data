Let's break this down step by step.

The couple saves money every week. The husband saves $335, and the wife saves $225. So, in total, they save $335 + $225 = $560 per week.

Since they save for 6 months, or 24 weeks, the total amount of money they save is $560 * 24 = $13440.

They decide to divide half of this amount into their four children's savings accounts. So, half of $13440 is $13440 / 2 = $6720.

Each child will receive $6720 / 4 = $1680.
