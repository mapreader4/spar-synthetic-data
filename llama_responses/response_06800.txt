Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Autumn started with 20 pencils.

Step 2: She misplaced 7 pencils, so she had 20 - 7 = 13 pencils left.

Step 3: She broke 3 pencils, so she lost 3 pencils, leaving her with 13 - 3 = 10 pencils.

Step 4: She found 4 pencils, so she gained 4 pencils, adding to her total, making it 10 + 4 = 14 pencils.

Step 5: She bought 2 pencils, so she gained 2 pencils, adding to her total, making it 14 + 2 = 16 pencils.

Answer: 16
