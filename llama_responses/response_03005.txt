Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the amount of money Jayda spent. Jayda spent $400.

Since Aitana spent 2/5 more than Jayda, we can set up an equation to represent the amount Aitana spent. Let's call the amount Aitana spent x.

The equation would be: x = 2/5 * 400 + 400

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction: x * 5 = 2 * 400 + 400 * 5

This simplifies to: 2 * 400 + 2000 = x

Combine like terms: 2000 + 2000 = x

x = 4000

So Aitana spent $4000.

To find the total amount of money they spent together, we can add the amounts: 400 + 4000 =?

Answer: 4400
