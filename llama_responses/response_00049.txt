Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Alan collected 4 times as many shells as Ben did. So, let's say Ben collected x shells. Then, Alan collected 4x shells.

Ben got a late start and only collected a third of what Laurie did. So, Laurie collected 36 shells. Since Alan collected 4x shells, Laurie collected 3/4 of that. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

Let's set up the equation: 4x = 3/4 * 36.

We can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get:

4x * 4 = 3/4 * 36 * 4.

Now we can simplify the right side of the equation by multiplying 36 * 4:

4x = 144 / 4.

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 36.

So, Alan collected 36 shells.
