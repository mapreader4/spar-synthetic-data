Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what we know:
- Billy weighs 9 pounds more than Brad.
- Brad weighs 5 pounds more than Carl.
- Carl weighs 145 pounds.

From this information, we can say that Brad weighs 145 - 5 = 140 pounds.
So, Brad weighs 140 pounds.
Now, Billy weighs 9 pounds more than Brad, so Billy weighs 9 + 140 = 149 pounds.
So, Billy weighs 149 pounds.
Answer: 149
