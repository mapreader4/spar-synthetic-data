Let's break this down step by step.

1. Andy started with a platter of chocolate cookies.
2. He ate 3 cookies himself.
3. He gave his little brother 5 cookies because he was behaving.
4. So, Andy gave away a total of 3 + 5 = 8 cookies.
5. He handed the platter to his basketball team of 8 members.
6. The first player took 1 cookie.
7. The second player took 3 cookies.
8. The third player took 5 cookies.
9. So, the total number of cookies taken by the first three players is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
10. There are 8 players in total, so the remaining cookies are 8 - 9 = 1.
11. Andy had 1 cookie left.
