Let's first find the total score of the students who took the test. There are 24 students who took the test, so the total score is 24 * 77 = 184. The average score of the students is 77, so the total score is 77 * 25 = 192. The total score of all the students is 192, so the total score of the absent student is 192 - 184 = 8. The lowest grade the absent student can get for the class to still get a pizza party is 8.
