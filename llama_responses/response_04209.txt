Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We are told that the cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 4 dozen is equal to 48 cookies. Since she only wants to make 4 dozen cookies, we can find the number of pounds of butter needed by dividing 48 cookies by 4.
