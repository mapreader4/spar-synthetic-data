Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the capacity of the theater: 400 seats.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets sold for the first show: 0.8 x 400 = 320.

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue for the first show: 320 tickets x $30 = $9600.

Step 4: Repeat this for the 2nd and 3rd shows: 2 x $9600 = $19200.

Step 5: Add the revenue from the 3 shows together: $9600 + $19200 = $21600.

Answer: 21600.
