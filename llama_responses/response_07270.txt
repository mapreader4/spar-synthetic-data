Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The plot of land is 110 feet wide and 120 feet long. To find the area of the plot, we multiply the width by the length: 110 x 120 = 13200 square feet.

2. The tiller digs a swath 2 feet wide, which means that for every 2 feet of tillage, it takes 1 foot of ground. So, the area that the tiller can till in 2 seconds is 1 foot.

3. To till the entire plot, we need to find how many 2-foot sections we need to till. To do this, we divide the total area of the plot by the area that the tiller can till in 2 seconds: 13200 square feet / 1 foot = 13200 / 1 = 13200 sections.

4. Now, we need to find the time it takes to till each section. Since the tiller takes 2 seconds to till 1 foot of ground, it will take 2 seconds to till 2 feet of ground, and since each section is 2 feet, it will take 2 x 2 = 4 seconds to till each section.

5. Finally, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to till each section: 13200 sections x 4 seconds = 52800 seconds.

6. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60: 52800 / 60 = 880.

Answer: 880
