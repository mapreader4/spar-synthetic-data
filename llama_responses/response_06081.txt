Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say that it costs x dollars to make one cookie. Then, it costs 1.2x dollars to make 1 cookie, since it costs 20% more than it costs to make 1 cookie.

Now, Joe sold 50 cookies. So, the total amount of money he earned is 50 * 1.2x. We know that he earned $60, so we can set up the equation:

50 * 1.2x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 60 / 1.2

x = 50

So, it costs 50 dollars to make 1 cookie.
