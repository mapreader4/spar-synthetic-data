Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we know that the sack of rice weighs 50 kilograms.
2. We know that the cost of 1 kilogram of rice is $1.20.
3. To find the cost of the sack of rice, we need to multiply the cost per kilogram by the weight of the sack, which is 50 kilograms.
4. The cost of the sack of rice is 50 kilograms * $1.20 per kilogram, which is equal to 50 * 1.20 = $60.
5. Since David sells the sack of rice for $50, his profit is the difference between the cost of the rice and the price he sells it for. The profit is $50 - $60 = $10.
