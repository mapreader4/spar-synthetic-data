Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The train starts with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. So, in total, there are 6 + 12 + 2 = 20 cars.

2. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. So, the maximum number of cars that can be deposited at each station is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.

3. Since there are 6 miles between each station, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them, the total number of stations is 6/6 = 1. So, the train will visit 1 station.

4. At each station, the train deposits 6 cars. So, in total, the number of cars deposited is 6 * 1 = 6.

5. The remaining cars left are 20 - 6 = 14.

6. Since the train deposits 6 cars at each station, it will need to visit 14 / 6 = 2 more stations to deliver all the cars.

7. The total time taken to travel 2 stations is 2 * 25 = 50 minutes.
