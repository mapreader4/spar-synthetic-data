Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of yellow candies: there are 4 yellow candies.

Next, let's identify the number of green candies: there are 2 fewer green candies than yellow candies, so there are 4 - 2 = 2 green candies.

Now, let's identify the number of purple candies: there are 10 purple candies.

Finally, let's find the total number of candies in the box: there are 10 + 4 + 2 = 16 candies in the box.

Answer: 16
