Let's start by converting the time worked by each person into hours and minutes. Bianca worked 12.5 hours. Celeste worked 12.5 * 2 = 25 hours. McClain worked 25 - 8.5 = 16.5 hours.

Now, we need to add the total number of hours worked by the three people. 12.5 + 25 + 16.5 = 54. The answer is 54 hours.
