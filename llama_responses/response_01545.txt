Let's break it down step by step.

Nina buys three toys at $10 each, so that is a total of $30. She buys two packs of basketball cards at $5 each, so that is a total of $10. She buys five shirts at $6 each, so that is a total of $30. So, in total, she spends $30 + $10 + $30 = $70. The answer is: Answer: 70.
