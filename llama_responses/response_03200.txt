Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the total length of the 100 pieces of ribbon. Each piece is 15 centimeters long, so the total length is:

100 x 15 = 1500 centimeters

Now, the ribbon is 51 meters long. We can convert this to centimeters by multiplying by 100 (since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters):

51 x 100 = 5100 centimeters

Now, we can subtract the length of the 100 pieces from the total length of the ribbon:

5100 - 1500 = 3600 centimeters

So, the amount of ribbon that remains is 3600 centimeters.

Answer: 3600
