Let's break this down step by step.

Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda, which is 5 x 12 oz = 60 oz. He also drinks 64 oz of water.

To find out how many ounces of fluid he drinks in a week, we need to multiply the amount of soda and water he drinks each day.

He drinks 60 oz of soda per day. So, in a week, he drinks 7 x 60 oz = 420 oz of soda.

He drinks 64 oz of water per day. So, in a week, he drinks 7 x 64 = 448 oz of water.

So, in a week, Tom drinks 420 oz of soda and 448 oz of water. Therefore, he drinks a total of 868 oz of fluid.

Answer: 868
