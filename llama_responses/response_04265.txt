Let's start by identifying the number of each type of coin Zain has. Zain has 10 more coins than Emerie, so we know that the total number of coins Zain has is 10 + 10 = 20. We are given the number of each type of coin Emerie has, which is 6 quarters, 7 dimes, and 5 nickels. So, we can add those numbers together to find the total number of coins Emerie has, which is 6 + 7 + 5 = 18. Since Zain has more coins than Emerie, we know that Zain has 20 - 18 = 2 more coins than Emerie. So, Zain has 2 quarters, 2 dimes, and 2 nickels.
