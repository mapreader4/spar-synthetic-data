Let's break this down step by step:

1. Ashley invited 20 friends, and then invited each of them to invite one more person to attend the party. This means that each of the 20 friends brought an additional person to the party. So, the total number of people Ashley invited is 20 + 20 = 40.

2. So, the total number of people Ashley invited is 40.

3. Ashley also invited herself to the party, so we need to add 1 to the total number of people.

4. The total number of people at the party is 40 (the 40 people Ashley invited) + 1 (Ashley herself) = 41.

Answer: 41
