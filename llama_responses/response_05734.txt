Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first figure out how many steps Darry climbed on his full ladder. He climbed his full ladder 10 times, which has 11 steps. So, he climbed 11 * 10 = 110 steps.

Next, let's figure out how many steps he climbed on his smaller ladder. He climbed his smaller ladder 7 times, which has 6 steps. So, he climbed 6 * 7 = 42 steps.

In total, Darry climbed 110 + 42 steps today. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 152
