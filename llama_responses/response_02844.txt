Let's start by thinking about this problem step by step.

Let's say Lucy's original doll collection has some number of dolls. Let's call this number x.

After buying 2 new dolls, the number of dolls in her collection is increased by 25%. So, the new number of dolls is x + 0.25x.

We know that the number of dolls is increased by 25%. So, the increase in the number of dolls is 0.25x.

The number of dolls before the increase is x, and the number of dolls after the increase is x + 0.25x.

The number of dolls after the increase is the sum of the original number of dolls and the increase in the number of dolls. This can be represented as:

x + 0.25x = x + 0.25x

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that the increase in the number of dolls is 25%. So, 0.25x = 25.

So, we have 0.25x = 25.

Now, we know that x is 40. So, the number of dolls after the increase is 40 + 0.25(40) = 50.

Answer: 50
