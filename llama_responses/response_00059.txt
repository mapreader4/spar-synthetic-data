Let's break this down step by step.

Joanne started with 0 coins.

During the first hour, she collected 15 coins, so she now has 15 coins.

For the next two hours, she collected 35 coins, so she now has 15 + 35 = 50 coins.

In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins, but gave away 15 to her coworker. So, she has 50 - 15 = 35 coins.

Answer: 35
