Let's break down the information given to us:

* The monthly bill is $45 for 100 GB.
* For every 1 GB over, the charge is $0.25.
* The bill is $65.

Let's first calculate the base charge of 100 GB. 100 GB - 45 = 55.

The bill is $65, so the amount over is 65 - 55 = 10.

The answer is: Answer: 10.
