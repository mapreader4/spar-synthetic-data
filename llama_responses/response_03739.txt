Let's break it down step by step.

Haley can hold 8 marshmallows.
Michael can hold 3 times as many as Haley, so he can hold 8 * 3 = 24 marshmallows.
Brandon can hold half as many as Michael, so he can hold 24 / 2 = 12 marshmallows.

To find the total number of marshmallows held by the three kids, we add up the number of marshmallows held by each of them:
8 + 24 + 12 = 44

Answer: 44
