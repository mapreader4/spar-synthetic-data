Let's think step by step.

Let's start by considering the width of the river, which is 42 feet. We know that the boats are 3 feet across, so we need to make sure that the boats have at least 2 feet between them.

Let's say there are x boats. Then, the total width of the boats will be 3x, which is 3x. We know that the total width of the river is 42, so we can set up an equation:

3x >= 42

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = 14

So, the answer is 14.
