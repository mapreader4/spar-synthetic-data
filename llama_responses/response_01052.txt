Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by letting J be John's age, which is 35.  We know that James is 23, which means James is 23.  We know that Tim is 5 years less than 2 times John's age, so we can write the equation: Tim = 2 * J - 5.

We are given that Tim is 79.  We can substitute J with 35, since J = 35 is given.  Then we can solve for Tim: Tim = 2 * 35 - 5 = 65.

So, James is 23.
