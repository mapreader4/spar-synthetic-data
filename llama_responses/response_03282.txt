Let's break down the information given into parts.

Mark was born in January 1976.  Mark's age is 45 years as of 2021.  Graham is 3 years younger than Mark, so Graham's age is 45 - 3 = 42 years as of 2021.

Graham's sister, Janice, is 1/2 the age of Graham, which is 42.  1/2 of 42 is 21.  So Janice's age is 21.

Answer: 21
