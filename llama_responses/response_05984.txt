Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of money that they shared.

Let's say the total amount of money they shared is x.

Since Maggie's share is 4,500, and she got 25% of the total amount, we can set up the equation 0.25x = 4,500.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to get 0.25x * 4 = 4,500 * 4. This gives us 2x = 18,000.

Now, since x is the total amount they shared, we can divide both sides by 2 to get x = 9,000.

So, the total amount of money they shared is 9,000.

Answer: 9,000
