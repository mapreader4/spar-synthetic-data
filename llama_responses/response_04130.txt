Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Kyle can lift x pounds this year. Since he can lift 60 pounds this year, which is 3 times as much as he could lift last year, we can set up an equation.

60 = 3x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3.

x = 60 / 3
x = 20

So Kyle can lift 20 pounds last year. To find the total pounds he can lift in all, we can add 20 to 60.

Answer: 80
