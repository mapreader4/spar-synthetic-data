Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of pens she gave to her friends.

She gave 8 pens to each of her 7 friends. So, the total number of pens she gave is 8 x 7 = 56.

Now, she had 60 pens initially. So, she gave away 56 pens, so the number of pens she has left is:

60 - 56 = 4
