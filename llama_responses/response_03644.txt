Let's break this problem down step by step.

Malcolm has 240 followers on Instagram and 500 followers on Facebook. So, the number of followers he has on Instagram and Facebook combined is 240 + 500 = 740.

The number of followers he has on Twitter is half the number of followers he has on Instagram and Facebook combined, which is 740 / 2 = 370.

The number of followers he has on TikTok is 3 times the number of followers he has on Twitter, which is 3 * 370 = 1110.

The number of followers he has on YouTube is 510, which is 510.

Now, let's add the number of followers he has on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube:

740 (Instagram and Facebook) + 370 (Twitter) + 1110 (TikTok) + 510 (YouTube) = 1730

Answer: 1730
