Let's break this problem down step by step.

Robi starts by saving $2 in January, so the total savings in January is $2.

In February, he saves $4, so the total savings becomes $2 + $4 = $6.

In March, he saves $8, so the total savings becomes $6 + $8 = $14.

Let's continue this pattern for 6 months. In each month, Robi saves an amount that is 2 more than the previous month. So, the amounts he saves in the next months are:

April: $10
May: $12
June: $14

The total savings in the 4th month is $14, and in the 5th month is $16, and in the 6th month is $18.

To find the total savings after 6 months, we add the amounts saved in each month:

$2 + $4 + $8 + $10 + $12 + $14 + $16 + $18 = $54
