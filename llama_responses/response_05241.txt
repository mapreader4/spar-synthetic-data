Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many dozens are in a dozen.

A dozen is equal to 12. So, if Chloe bought 50 dozen, she has 50 * 12 = 600 strawberries.

Next, let's find out how many strawberries she sold. She sold half a dozen, which is equal to 6.

She sold 6 dozens, which is equal to 6 * 12 = 72 strawberries.

So, she sold 72 strawberries. She bought 600 strawberries for 50 dollars. So, the cost price of each strawberry is 600 / 50 = 12.

She sold 72 strawberries for 30 dollars. So, the selling price of each strawberry is 72 / 6 = 12.

To find out her profit, we need to subtract the cost price from the selling price.

Cost price per strawberry = 12
Selling price per strawberry = 12

Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 12 - 12 = 0

Chloe's profit is 0 dollars.
