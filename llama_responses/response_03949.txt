Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of stamps that are Japanese. We know that 35% of the stamps are Chinese, and 20% are US stamps. We can find the number of Japanese stamps by subtracting the number of Chinese and US stamps from the total number of stamps.

Let's calculate the number of Chinese stamps first. 35% of 100 is 35. So, Nikka has 35 Chinese stamps.

Now, let's find the number of US stamps. 20% of 100 is 20. So, Nikka has 20 US stamps.

Now, to find the number of Japanese stamps, we need to subtract the number of Chinese and US stamps from the total number of stamps. We know that the total number of stamps is 100, and we know that 35 + 20 = 55 stamps are not Japanese. So, to find the number of Japanese stamps, we subtract 55 from 100. 100 - 55 is 45.

Answer: 45
