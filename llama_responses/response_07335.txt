Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many dryer sheets Sophie uses in a year.

Sophie uses 1 sheet per load, and she does 4 loads a week. So, in a year, she uses 52 loads. Since each load requires 1 sheet, she uses 52 sheets a year.

Step 2: Determine how much money she would spend on dryer sheets in a year.

Sophie would normally spend 52 x 5.50 = 26.50 dollars on dryer sheets in a year.

Step 3: Determine how much she saves by using wool dryer balls.

The wool dryer balls are free, so she does not spend any money on them.

Step 4: Determine the amount of money she saves.

Sophie saves 26.50 dollars in a year by not buying dryer sheets.

Answer: 26.50
