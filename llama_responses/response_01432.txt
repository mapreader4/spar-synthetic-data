I will think step by step, stating my reasoning before stating my conclusion.

Let's call the original price of the car x. Since Venny spent $15000 on the car, and 40% of the original price is 15000, we know that 0.4x = 15000.

To find the original price, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 to get the original price. So, we get:

x = 15000 / 0.4 = x = 37500

So, the original price of the car was $37500.
