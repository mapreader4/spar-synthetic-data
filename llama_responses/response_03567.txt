Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of students who were invited to the party. Since 70% of the students showed up to the party, that means 0.7 * 400 = 280 students were invited. 

Now, let's find the number of students who were not allowed into the party. Since 40% of the invited students were not allowed into the party, that means 0.4 * 280 = 112 students were not allowed into the party.

So, the number of students who attended the party is the total number of invited students minus the number of students who were not allowed into the party. That is, 280 - 112 = 168 students attended the party.

Answer: 168
