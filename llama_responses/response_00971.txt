Let's break down the problem step by step.

Annabelle has a weekly allowance of $30. She spent a third of it, which is 30 รท 3 = $10 on junk food. Then she spent another $8 on sweets. 

So, she spent a total of $10 + $8 = $18. 

To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from her original allowance: $30 - $18 = $12.

Answer: 12
