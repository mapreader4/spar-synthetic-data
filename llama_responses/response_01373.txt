Let's start by identifying the total area of the land: 20,000 square meters.

Now, we need to divide the land equally among the five siblings. To do this, we can divide 20,000 by 5 (since there are 5 siblings).

20,000 รท 5 = 4,000

So, Jose will have 4,000 square meters of land after dividing it with his siblings.
