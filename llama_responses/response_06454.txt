Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the original number of turtles. We know that "a group of nine turtles sat on a log." So, the original number of turtles is 9.

Then, "two less than three times the original number of turtles" means that we need to find 3 times the original number of turtles and subtract 2 from the result. So, 3 x 9 = 27, and 27 - 2 = 25. So, the large group of turtles is 25.

Now, "half of the large group of turtles" means that we need to find half of 25, which is 12. Then, "half of the large group of turtles were frightened by a sound and jumped off of the log and ran away." So, 12 turtles jumped off the log.

Finally, we need to find the remaining turtles that remained on the log. The original 9 turtles were on the log initially, and we subtracted 12 from that to get to the final number. So, the answer is:

Answer: 9 - 12 = 3.
