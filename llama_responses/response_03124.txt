Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first older sister has half as many clothes as Nicole, so she has 5 pieces of clothing (since Nicole has 10 and half of 10 is 5).
2. The next older sister has 2 more pieces of clothing than Nicole, so she has 7 pieces of clothing (since Nicole has 5 and 5 + 2 = 7).
3. The oldest sister has the average of what her three younger sisters had. This means she has the average of 5 + 7 = 6.

So, the oldest sister has 6 pieces of clothing.

4. Nicole started with 10 pieces of clothing, and her three sisters gave her all their clothes. So, she ends up with 10 + 5 + 7 = 22 pieces of clothing.

Answer: 22
