Let's break this down step by step:

1. Carly practices her butterfly stroke for 3 hours a day, 4 days a week, so she practices it 3 * 4 = 12 hours a week.
2. Carly practices her backstroke for 2 hours a day, 6 days a week, so she practices it 2 * 6 = 12 hours a week.
3. In a month with 4 weeks, Carly practices butterfly stroke for 12 hours a week and backstroke for 12 hours a week, so she practices swimming in total for 12 + 12 = 24 hours a month.
