Let's break it down step by step:

Harry sleeps for 8 hours on Monday night.
Harry sleeps for 7 hours on Tuesday night.
Harry sleeps for 8 hours on Wednesday night.
Harry sleeps for 7 hours on Thursday night.

To find the average number of hours Harry sleeps in one night, we need to add up the number of hours he sleeps each night and divide by 4 (since there are 4 nights).

8 + 7 + 8 + 7 = 30

30 รท 4 = 7.5

So, the average number of hours Harry sleeps in one night is 7.5 hours.
