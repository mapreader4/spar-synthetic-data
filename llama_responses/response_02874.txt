Let's break down the number of text messages sent by Jason for each day. 

On Monday, Jason sent 220 text messages. 

On Tuesday, he sent half as many text messages as he sent on Monday, which is 220 / 2 = 110 text messages.

On Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Friday, Jason sent 50 text messages each day. So, the total number of text messages for these three days is 50 + 50 + 50 = 150 text messages.

So, the total number of text messages sent by Jason is 220 + 110 + 150 = 480.
