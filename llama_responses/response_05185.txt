Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many swordfish Shelly catches. Since Shelly catches 2 less than 5, we can set up an equation to represent the number of swordfish Shelly catches. Let's call the number of swordfish Shelly catches "S".

S = 5 - 2

S = 3

So Shelly catches 3 swordfish.

Next, let's find out how many swordfish Sam catches. Sam catches 1 less than Shelly, so we can set up an equation to represent the number of swordfish Sam catches. Let's call the number of swordfish Sam catches "S - 1".

S - 1 = 3

S - 1 = 2

So Sam catches 2 swordfish.

Now, let's find the total number of swordfish they catch. We know Shelly catches 3 swordfish and Sam catches 2 swordfish. We can add these numbers together to get the total number of swordfish they catch.

3 + 2 = 5

Answer: 5
