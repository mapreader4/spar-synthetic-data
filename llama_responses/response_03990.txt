Let's start by identifying the cost of the rice and chicken.

The rice costs 10 cents per plate and the chicken costs 40 cents per plate. 

To find the total cost of the rice, we can multiply the cost of rice per plate by the number of plates. There are 100 plates, so the total cost of rice is 100 x 0.10 = 10 dollars.

The total cost of chicken is 100 x 0.40 = 40 dollars.

To find the total cost of the food, we add the cost of rice and chicken together. So, the total cost is 10 + 40 = 50 dollars.

Answer: 50
