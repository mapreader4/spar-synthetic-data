Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Marcus has 27 crackers, and we know that Marcus has three times as many crackers as Mona. So, Mona must have 27 รท 3 = 9 crackers.

We also know that Nicholas has 6 more crackers than Mona. So, Nicholas has 9 + 6 = 15 crackers.
