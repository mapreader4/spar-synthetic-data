Let's think step by step.

Let's say Mark buys the Magic card for $100. So, the cost of the Magic card is $100.

Now, if the Magic card triples in value, then it would be worth 3 times its original value, which is 3 x $100 = $300.

So, Mark sells the Magic card for $300. 

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the selling price. 

Profit = Selling price - Cost = $300 - $100 = $200.

Answer: 200
