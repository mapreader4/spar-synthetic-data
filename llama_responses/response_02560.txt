Let's break this down step by step.

1. Mr. Smith has a balance of $150 that he needs to pay.
2. He incurs a 2% finance charge, which is a percentage of his balance.
3. To find the finance charge, multiply the balance by the finance charge percentage: 150 * 0.02 = 3.
4. Mr. Smith will pay the finance charge of $3.
5. To find the total amount he needs to pay, add the balance and the finance charge: 150 + 3 = 153.

Answer: 153
