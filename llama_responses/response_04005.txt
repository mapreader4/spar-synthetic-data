Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total amount of money Shelby had before buying any books or posters.

Shelby had $20 initially.

She spent $8 on the first book, so she has:

$20 - $8 = $12

Then, she bought a book for $4, so she has:

$12 - $4 = $8

Now, she wants to buy as many $4 posters as she can with the $8 she has left. Let's divide $8 by $4 to find out how many posters she can buy:

$8 รท $4 = 2

So, Shelby can buy 2 posters.
