Let's break it down step by step.

1. John volunteers at a shelter twice a month, which means he volunteers 2 times in a month.
2. Each time he volunteers for 3 hours, so he volunteers 3 hours each time.
3. So, in a month, he volunteers 2 * 3 hours, which is 6 hours.
4. To find out how many hours he volunteers in a year, we need to multiply 6 hours by 12, since there are 12 months in a year.
5. 6 hours * 12 is 72.

Answer: 72
