Let's start by identifying the relationship between the number of M&M candies and the number of Starburst candies.

For every 3 Starburst candies, there are 5 M&M candies. So, to find the number of Starburst candies, we can divide the total number of M&M candies by 5.

Let's write an equation to represent this relationship:

M&M candies / 5 = Starburst candies

We know that Penelope has 25 M&M candies. To find the number of Starburst candies, we can plug in the value of M&M candies into the equation:

25 / 5 =?

To solve this equation, we can divide 25 by 5:

25 / 5 = 5

Answer: 5
