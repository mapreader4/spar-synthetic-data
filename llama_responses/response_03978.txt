Let's break it down step by step.

James writes 10 pages an hour, and 1 hour is 60 minutes. 10 pages is equal to 20 minutes. So, James writes 20 minutes an hour.

He writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people. So, James writes 10 pages a day to 2 people.

To find out how many hours a week he writes, we can multiply the number of pages written per day by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week. So, James writes 10 pages a day * 7 days = 70 pages a week.

Now, we need to convert this to hours. 1 hour is 60 minutes. 10 pages is equal to 20 minutes. So, 20 minutes is equal to 1/3 of an hour. 20 * 7 is equal to 140 minutes, which is equal to 2.33 hours.

So, James writes 2.33 hours a week.

Answer: 2.33
