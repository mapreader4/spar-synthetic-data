Let's start by identifying the number of tissues Tucker has left.

Tucker had 160 tissues in the box initially. He used 210 tissues while he was sick with the flu. So, to find the number of tissues left, we subtract the number of tissues used from the initial number of tissues:

160 - 210 =?

Let's subtract 210 from 160:

160 - 200 = 40

So, Tucker would have 40 tissues left.
