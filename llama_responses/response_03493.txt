Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of whiskers Princess Puff has. We are given that Princess Puff has 14 whiskers.

Next, we are told that Catman Do has 6 less than twice the number of whiskers as Princess Puff. To find the number of whiskers Catman Do has, we can multiply the number of whiskers Princess Puff has by 2 and then subtract 6.

14 * 2 = 28
28 - 6 = 22

So, Catman Do has 22 whiskers.

Answer: 22
