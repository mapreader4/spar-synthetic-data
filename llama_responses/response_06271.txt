Let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the lunch is $100.
2. The sales tax is 4%, so we need to calculate 4% of the total cost. To do this, we multiply the cost by 0.04.
3. The cost of the lunch is $100, so 0.04 x 100 = 4.
4. The total cost with tax is 4 dollars.
5. Then, Greg left a 6% tip. We need to calculate 6% of the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.06.
6. The total cost is $100, so 0.06 x 100 = 6.
7. We add the cost of the lunch, the tax, and the tip together. The total amount Greg paid is 100 + 4 + 6 = 110.

Answer: 110
