Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Grandma left $124,600 in her will. She gave half of that to her favorite grandchild, Shelby, so we can find out how much Shelby received.

To find out how much Shelby received, we can divide the total amount by 2:

$124,600 รท 2 = $62,300

So Shelby received $62,300.

Now, the remaining amount is the total amount minus the amount Shelby received:

$124,600 - $62,300 = $62,300

This leaves $62,300 for the remaining 10 grandchildren to divide evenly. To find out how much each of them received, we can divide the remaining amount by 10:

$62,300 รท 10 = $6,230

Answer: 6230
