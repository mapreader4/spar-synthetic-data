Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John bought 20 cards for Christmas gifts.
2. He also bought 15 cards for birthday gifts.
3. The cost of each card is $2.

To find the total cost of the cards, we need to multiply the number of cards by the cost of each card.

20 cards for Christmas gifts x $2 = 20 x 2 = $40
15 cards for birthday gifts x $2 = 15 x 2 = $30

The total cost of the cards is the sum of the cost of the Christmas gifts and birthday gifts.
$40 + $30 = $70

Answer: 70
