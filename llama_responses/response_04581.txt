Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The dairy farm produces 200 gallons of milk every day.
2. The income from the sale of milk is calculated as follows:
   - 200 gallons * 31 days in June = 6200 gallons
   - 6200 gallons * 3.55 = 21,300
3. The total income in June is the total income from milk sales minus the monthly expenses of $3000:
   - 21300 - 3000 = 18300

Answer: 18300
