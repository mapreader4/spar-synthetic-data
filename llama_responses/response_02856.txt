Let's break down the problem step by step.

It takes 10 minutes to get to her house, which is the starting point.

Then, it takes 5 times as long to get to the airport, which is 5 x 10 = 50 minutes.

After that, it takes 15 minutes to check her bag, which is an additional 15 minutes.

Next, it takes three times as long to get through security, which is 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.

After security, she has to wait for 20 minutes for her flight to start boarding.

Finally, she has to wait twice as long before the plane is ready to take off, which is 2 x 20 = 40 minutes.

To add up the total time, we have:

10 + 50 + 15 + 45 + 20 + 40 = 175 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

175 minutes รท 60 = 2.91667 hours

Since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total time will be:

Answer: 2 hours
