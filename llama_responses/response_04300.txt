Let's break this problem down step by step.

Anie needs 5 hours extra aside from her normal 10 hours of work, so her total daily work hours are 10 + 5 = 15 hours.

The project is estimated to take 1500 hours, and we need to find the number of days it would take Anie to finish the job.

Let's divide the total hours required to complete the project (1500 hours) by the number of hours Anie works each day (15 hours):

1500 hours (total hours) รท 15 hours (daily work hours) = 100 days

So, it would take Anie 100 days to finish the job.

Answer: 100
