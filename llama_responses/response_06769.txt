Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of fish that Ken caught. Ken caught twice as many fish as Kendra, so we can set up an equation. Let's call the number of fish that Ken caught x. We know that Kendra caught 30 fish, so we can write the equation as 2x = 30. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2 to get x = 15. So Ken caught 15 fish.

Ken released 3 fish back into the lake, so we subtract 3 from 15 to get 12. So, Ken and Kendra brought home 15 + 12 = 27 fish. Answer: 27.
