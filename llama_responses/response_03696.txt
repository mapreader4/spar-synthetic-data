Let's break this down step by step.

From Monday to Friday, Christina walks 7km to school and back, so she covers a total of 14km. On Friday, she walks an extra 2km to her friend's place. So, the total distance she covered that day is 2km.

To find the total distance she covered that week, we add the distance she walked to school and back, which is 14km, and the distance to her friend's place, which is 2km. So, the total distance she covered that week is:

14km + 2km = 16km

Answer: 16
