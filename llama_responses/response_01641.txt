Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total time of the movie, which is 2.5 hours, or 150 minutes.

Since John uses the bathroom every 50 minutes, we can divide the total time by 150 by 50 to find the number of times he uses the bathroom:

150 minutes รท 50 = 3

So, John uses the bathroom 3 times during the 2.5-hour movie.
