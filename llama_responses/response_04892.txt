Let's break it down step by step.

Liam has saved $500 per month for 2 years. That means he has saved a total of $500 * 24 = $12,000.

Liam has bills of $3,500. So, he needs to subtract his bills from his total savings.

$12,000 - $3,500 = $8,500.

So, Liam will have $8,500 left after paying his bills.
