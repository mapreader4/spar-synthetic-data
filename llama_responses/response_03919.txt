Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first identify the information given:

* Leila eats cake almost every week.
* She ate 6 cakes on Monday.
* She ate 9 cakes on Friday.
* She ate triple the number of cakes she ate on Monday on Saturday.

We can start by identifying the number of cakes she ate on Monday. This is 6 cakes. Then, we can find the number of cakes she ate on Saturday. Since she ate triple the number of cakes she ate on Monday, this is 6 x 3 = 18.

So, we can add the number of cakes she ate on Monday and Saturday: 6 + 18 = 24.

Answer: 24
