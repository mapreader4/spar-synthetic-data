Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Let's figure out how many ounces of coffee they need in total.

Since they finish 3 dozen donuts, that's 3 * 12 = 36 ounces of donuts. They need 36 ounces of coffee to dunk them in.

Step 2: Now, we need to find out how much coffee they need. They need 36 ounces of coffee, and each pot has 12 ounces, so they need 36 / 12 = 3 pots of coffee.

Step 3: Finally, let's find out how much it costs to make 3 pots of coffee.

Each pot of coffee costs $3, so 3 pots of coffee will cost 3 * $3 = $9.

Answer: $9
