Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the height of the tallest tree. The tallest tree is 108 feet.

Next, the middle sized tree is 6 feet less than half the height of the tallest tree. Half of 108 is 54. So, the middle tree is 108 - 6 = 102 feet.

The smallest tree is 1/4 the height of the middle tree. The height of the middle tree is 102 feet, so the smallest tree is 102 / 4 = 25.75 feet.

Answer: 25.75
