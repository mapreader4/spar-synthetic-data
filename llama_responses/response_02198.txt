Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of individual items in Jonas' current wardrobe:

* 20 pairs of socks = 20
* 5 pairs of shoes = 5
* 10 pairs of pants = 10
* 10 pairs of t-shirts = 10

The total number of individual items is: 20 + 5 + 10 + 10 = 35

To double the number of individual items, Jonas needs to buy:

35 * 2 = 70

So, Jonas needs to buy 70 - 35 = 35 pairs of socks to double the number of individual items in his wardrobe.
