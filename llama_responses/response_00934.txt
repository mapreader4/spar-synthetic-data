Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of turtles that Marion received is x.

Since Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha, it means that the number of turtles that Marion received is 20 more than the number of turtles that Martha received.

So, the equation can be written as:

x = 20 + 40

To solve for x, we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 40

So, Marion received 40 turtles, and the total number of turtles that they received together is:

Answer: 40
