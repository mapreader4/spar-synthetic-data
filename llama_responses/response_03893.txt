Let's break down the problem step by step.

Rocco has 4 piles of quarters, so he has 4 x 25 = 100 quarters.

He has 6 piles of dimes, so he has 6 x 10 = 60 dimes.

He has 9 piles of nickels, so he has 9 x 5 = 45 nickels.

He has 5 piles of pennies, so he has 5 x 1 = 5 pennies.

Adding all the coins together, Rocco has 100 + 60 + 45 + 5 = 225 coins.
