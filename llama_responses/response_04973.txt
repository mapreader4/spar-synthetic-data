Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of pounds of trout James caught.  James caught 200 pounds of trout.

Next, we need to find the number of pounds of salmon James caught.  James caught 50% more pounds of salmon, so 50% of 200 pounds of salmon is 0.5 * 200 = 100 pounds of salmon.

Finally, we need to find the number of pounds of Tuna James caught.  James caught twice as much Tuna as salmon, so the number of pounds of Tuna is 2 * 100 = 200 pounds of Tuna.

To find the total number of pounds of fish James caught, we add 200 pounds of trout, 100 pounds of salmon, and 200 pounds of Tuna. 200 + 100 + 200 = 400 pounds of fish.

Answer: 400
