Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of students is 24.

Half of the students are doing silent reading, which is 12.

A third of the students are playing board games, which is 8.

So, to find the number of students catching up on homework, we need to subtract the number of students doing silent reading (12) and the number of students playing board games (8) from the total number of students (24).

12 - 8 = 16.

Answer: 16
