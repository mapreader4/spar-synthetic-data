Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. Anika has 4 more than twice the number of pencils as Reeta. Since Reeta has 20 pencils, that means Anika has 20 * 2 = 40 pencils. Now, we need to find the total number of pencils that Anika and Reeta have together.

To do this, we can add the number of pencils each of them has: 20 + 40 = 60. So, the answer is:

Answer: 60
