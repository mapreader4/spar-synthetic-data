Let's break it down step by step:

1. The movie tickets cost $10.00 each. Since Connor is going with a date, he will need 2 tickets, so that's a total of $20.00.
2. The large popcorn & 2 drink combo meal costs $11.00, so that's an additional $11.00.
3. Each box of candy costs $2.50, and Connor is buying two, so that's an additional $5.00.

Adding all these up, we get:

$20.00 (movie tickets) + $11.00 (combo meal) + $5.00 (candy) = $36.00
