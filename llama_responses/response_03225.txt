Let's break it down step by step.

Chris bought 8 movies on DVD for $12 each. So the total cost of the movies on DVD is 8 x 12 = 96.

Chris also bought 4 movies on Blu-ray for $18 each. So the total cost of the movies on Blu-ray is 4 x 18 = 72.

The total cost of all the movies is the sum of the cost of the movies on DVD and the cost of the movies on Blu-ray. So the total cost is 96 + 72 = 168.

Chris bought 12 movies in total. To find the average cost per movie, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of movies. So the average cost per movie is 168 / 12 = 14.

Answer: 14
