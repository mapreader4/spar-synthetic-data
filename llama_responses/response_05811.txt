Let's break down the problem step by step.

Julie mowed lawns for 25 hours in September. She earns 25 x $4 = $100 for mowing lawns. She pulled weeds for 3 hours in September. She earns 3 x $8 = $24 for pulling weeds. In total, she earned $100 + $24 = $124 in September.

In October, she worked the same number of hours. She mowed lawns for the same number of hours and pulled weeds for the same number of hours. So, she earned the same amount of money.

Answer: $124.
