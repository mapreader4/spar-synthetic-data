Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie works for $8 an hour, so her daily earnings are:

8 * 8 = 64

She works for 35 hours a week, so her weekly earnings are:

64 * 35 = 2240

Since it's been a month, she has worked for 4 weeks:

2240 * 4 = 8960

Carrie wants to buy a bike for $400, so she has:

8960 - 400 = 8560

Carrie will have 8560 - 400 = 8160 left over after she buys her bike.

Answer: 8160
