Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the purses. Tirzah has 26 purses. Half of 26 is 13, so 13 purses are fake. So, the number of genuine purses is 26 - 13 = 13.

Now, let's look at the handbags. Tirzah has 24 handbags. 1/4 of 24 is 6, so 6 handbags are fake. So, the number of genuine handbags is 24 - 6 = 18.

So, the total number of genuine purses is 13, and the total number of genuine handbags is 18. So, the answer is:

Answer: 13 + 18 = 31.
