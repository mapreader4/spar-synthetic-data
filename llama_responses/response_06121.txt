Let's break down the problem step by step.

The first step is to find the amount of discount on the Delta Airlines flight. The discount is 20% off the original price, so we need to calculate 20% of the original price. 20% of 850 is 0.20 * 850 = 170.

The second option is the United Airlines flight. The discount is 30% off the original price. 30% of 1100 is 0.30 * 1100 = 330.

Now, we need to compare the two discounts. We need to find the difference between the two discounts. 170 - 330 = -160.

So, the answer is -160.
