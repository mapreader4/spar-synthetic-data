Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that one-fourth of the box contains oranges. This means that one-fourth of the 56 pieces of fruit are oranges.

We are also given that there are half as many peaches as oranges. So, if we let x be the number of oranges, then the number of peaches is also x. Since there are five times as many apples as peaches, then the number of apples is 5x.

We know that the total number of fruit is 56. So, the number of oranges plus the number of peaches plus the number of apples is 56.

We can set up the equation:

x + x + 5x = 56

We can combine the x terms by combining like terms:

x + x = 56 - 5x

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = (56 - 5x)/2

x = 28

So, the number of oranges is 28. Since there are half as many peaches as oranges, the number of peaches is also 28. The number of apples is 5 times the number of peaches, so the number of apples is:

5 * 28 = 140

Answer: 140
