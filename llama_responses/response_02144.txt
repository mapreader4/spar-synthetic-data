To find the cost of the coffee, we need to calculate the number of coffee pods she will need for the entire vacation. 

Since she will have 40 days, and she will have 3 cups of coffee each morning, the total number of cups is 40 * 3 = 120 cups. 

Each box of coffee pods contains 30 pods.  So, the total number of pods she will need is 120 cups / 3 pods per cup = 40 boxes. 

The cost of each box is $8.00. 40 boxes will cost 40 x 8.00 = 320.00.  So, the total cost of the coffee will be 320.00.
