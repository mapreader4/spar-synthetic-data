Let's start by letting x be the cost of one chocolate bar.  If the cost of four chocolate bars is equal to the cost of 8 magazines, then the cost of 8 magazines is 4x the cost of one chocolate bar.  If one magazine costs $1, then the cost of 8 magazines is 8x the cost of one magazine.  Therefore, the cost of one chocolate bar is 1/8th the cost of one magazine.  If the cost of one chocolate bar is 1/8th the cost of one magazine, then the cost of a dozen chocolate bars is 12x the cost of one magazine.  Therefore, the cost of a dozen chocolate bars is 12x the cost of one magazine.  So, the cost of a dozen chocolate bars is 12x the cost of one magazine.  If the cost of one magazine is 1, then the cost of a dozen chocolate bars is 12x the cost of one magazine, which is $12.  So, the cost of a dozen chocolate bars is 12x the cost of one magazine, which is 12x$1, which is $\boxed{12}$.
Answer: 12
