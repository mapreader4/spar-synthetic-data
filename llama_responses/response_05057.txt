Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: There are 21 cherry tomatoes on the tomato plant.
Step 2: 2 birds eat one-third of the tomatoes. To find one-third of 21, we can divide 21 by 3, which gives us 7.
Step 3: 2 birds eat 7 tomatoes.
Step 4: To find out how many tomatoes are left, we subtract 7 from 21. 21 - 7 = 14.
Answer: 14
