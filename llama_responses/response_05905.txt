Let's break down the information:

- There are 10 dishes in total.
- 2 dishes have beans and lentils.
- 2 dishes have beans and seitan.
- The remaining dishes only have one kind of protein in them.
- Half of the remaining dishes have only beans, so that is 5 dishes.
- There are 3 times as many dishes with only beans as with only seitan.

Let's find the number of dishes with lentils. We know that there are 2 dishes with beans and lentils, and 2 dishes with beans and seitan. We also know that there are 5 dishes with only beans. 

The number of dishes with lentils is 2 (beans and lentils) + 5 (only beans) = 7. The answer is 7.

Answer: 7
