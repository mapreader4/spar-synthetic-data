Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of pencils each group of students bought. The first two students bought 2 pencils each, so that's 2 pencils. The next six students bought 3 pencils each, so that's 6 pencils. The last two students bought 1 pencil each, so that's 2 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we need to add these up.

2 + 6 + 2 = 8

Answer: 8
