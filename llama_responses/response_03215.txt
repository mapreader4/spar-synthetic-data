To solve this problem, we will have to calculate the volume of the balloon at each hour and then add them up.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. The balloon's original volume is 500cm³.
2. In the first hour, the balloon's volume will increase by two-fifths of its previous volume. This is 2/5 of 500, which is 200cm³.
3. The balloon's volume after the first hour is 500 + 200 = 700cm³.
4. In the second hour, the balloon's volume will increase by two-fifths of its previous volume again. This is 2/5 of 700, which is 140cm³.
5. The balloon's volume after the second hour is 700 + 140 = 840cm³.

So, the balloon's volume after 2 hours underwater is 840cm³.

Answer: 840
