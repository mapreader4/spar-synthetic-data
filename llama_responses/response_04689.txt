To find the total number of eggs collected by the three people, we can start by identifying how many eggs Benjamin collects. Since Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day, that is 6 x 12 = 72 eggs. Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects, which is 3 x 72 = 216 eggs. Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin, which is 72 - 4 = 68 eggs. The total number of eggs collected is the sum of these three numbers, which is 72 + 216 + 68 = 356. Since we are asked for the total number of eggs in dozens, we need to convert 356 to dozens. 1 dozen is 12, so 356 รท 12 = 29.67. Since we can't collect a fraction of an egg, we round down to the nearest whole number of dozens, which is 29.
