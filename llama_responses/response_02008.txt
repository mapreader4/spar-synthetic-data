To find the number of dives needed, we can set up a proportion.

Let's say x be the number of dives Jamie has to make. We know that 25% of oysters have pearls in them, which means that 25% of the oysters he collects will have pearls.

Since Jamie collects 16 oysters in each dive, we know that 16 is 25% of the total number of oysters he collects. So, the total number of oysters he collects in all dives will be 16x.

We know that Jamie wants to collect 56 pearls. So, we can set up a proportion to find the value of x:

16x = 56

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 16:

x = 56 / 16

x = 3.5

So, Jamie has to make 3.5 dives to collect 56 pearls.
