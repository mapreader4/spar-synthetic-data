Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of flowers Justin needs to collect. Since he needs one flower for each of the 30 classmates, the total number of flowers needed is 30.

Justin has lost 3 of the flowers he initially gathered. So, he has gathered 30 - 3 = 27 flowers.

He has been gathering for 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Since it takes him on average 10 minutes to find a flower he likes, we can find the total time he has spent so far by multiplying the number of flowers he has found by the time it takes to find a flower: 27 * 10 = 270 minutes. He has spent 270 minutes so far.

To find out how many more minutes he needs, we subtract the total time he has spent from the total time he has been gathering: 120 - 270 = 150 minutes.

Answer: 150
