Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: 

* Antonella has 10 Canadian coins in her purse.
* A loonie equals $1.
* A toonie equals $2.
* She bought a $3 Frappuccino and has $11 left.
* We need to find out how many toonies she initially had.

Let's start by identifying the value of the coins in her purse. 

Let's say she has x toonies and y loonies. 

The total value of the coins in her purse is 1x + 2y. 

Since the total value is $11 after spending $3 on the Frappuccino, we can set up an equation to solve for y.

1x + 2y = 11 - 3

To solve for y, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation.

1x + 2y = 8

Now we can solve for y.

x = 0 (since 1x = 0) and y = 4.

So, Antonella initially had 4 toonies.
