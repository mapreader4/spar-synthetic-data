Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The device records the temperature every 5 seconds.
2. The total time period is 1 hour = 60 minutes = 60 * 60 seconds = 3600 seconds.
3. Since the device records the temperature every 5 seconds, the total number of instances of data recorded will be the total time divided by 5.
4. 3600 seconds รท 5 = 720.

Answer: 720
