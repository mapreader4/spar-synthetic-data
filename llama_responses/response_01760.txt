Let's first find out how much each friend lost in total in 10 weeks. Aleesia lost 1.5 pounds each week for 10 weeks. So, she lost 1.5 * 10 = 15 pounds. Alexei lost 2.5 pounds each week for 8 weeks. So, he lost 2.5 * 8 = 20 pounds. 

Now, let's find the total pounds lost by both of them. 15 + 20 = 35. The two friends lost 35 pounds.
