Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find the reduced price of the shirt and the leather jacket after the 20% discount.

The original price of the shirt is $60, and we need to reduce it by 20%. To find the reduced price, we multiply the original price by (1 - 0.20) = 0.8.

$60 x 0.8 = $48

So, the reduced price of the shirt is $48.

The original price of the leather jacket is $90, and we need to reduce it by 20%. To find the reduced price, we multiply the original price by (1 - 0.20) = 0.8.

$90 x 0.8 = $72

So, the reduced price of the leather jacket is $72.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money Teagan will pay for buying 5 shirts and 10 leather jackets.

The cost of 5 shirts at the reduced price of $48 each is:

5 x $48 = $240

The cost of 10 leather jackets at the reduced price of $72 each is:

10 x $72 = $720

The total amount Teagan will pay is the sum of the cost of the shirts and the cost of the leather jackets:

$240 + $720 = $960

Answer: 960
