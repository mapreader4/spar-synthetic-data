Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the total number of pieces of bread thrown in the pond is x.

The first duck eats half of all the pieces of bread, so it eats x/2 pieces of bread.

The second duck eats 13 pieces of bread.

The third duck eats 7 pieces of bread.

The total number of pieces of bread eaten by the ducks is x/2 + 13 + 7.

The number of pieces of bread left in the water is 30.

So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/2 + 13 + 7) = 30

To solve for x, we can subtract x/2 + 13 + 7 from both sides of the equation to get:

x - x/2 = 30 - 13 - 7

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

x - x/2 = 10

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation, we get:

-x/2 = -10

Multiplying both sides of the equation by -2, we get:

x = -20

So, the total number of pieces of bread thrown in the pond is -20.

Answer: -20
