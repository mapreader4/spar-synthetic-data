Let's start by identifying the total cost of the two parts that Mark spent on his car. The cost of the two parts is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars. The total cost is 220 - 40 = 180 dollars. The labor cost is.5 dollars per minute. To find the number of hours the mechanic worked, we can divide the labor cost by the labor rate. The labor cost is 180 dollars. The labor rate is.5 dollars per minute. So, we can set up an equation:

0.5 * x = 180

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

0.5x * 2 = 180 * 2

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5:

x = 360 / 0.5
x = 720

So, the mechanic worked for 720 minutes.
