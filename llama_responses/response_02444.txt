Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount raised so far:

10 Bronze Status families x $25 = $250
7 Silver Status families x $50 = $350
1 Gold Status family x $100 = $100

Total amount raised so far = $250 + $350 + $100 = $700

The school's goal is to raise $750. To find out how much they need to raise on the final day, we subtract the total amount raised so far from the goal:

$750 - $700 = $50

Answer: 50
