Let's start by identifying the problem. We know that Zoe needs to earn the rest of the money, which is $485 - $250 = $235. She makes $1.25 for every candy bar she sells. We can set up an equation to represent this:

1.25x = 235

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides by 1.25:

x = 235 / 1.25
x = 188

Answer: 188
