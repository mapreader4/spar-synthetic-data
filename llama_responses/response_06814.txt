Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of people on the second bus. If the first bus has 12 people, and the second bus has twice the number of people as the first bus, then the second bus has 2 x 12 = 24 people.

The third bus has 6 fewer people than the second bus, so it has 24 - 6 = 18 people.

The fourth bus has 9 more people than the first bus, so it has 12 + 9 = 21 people.

Now, let's find the total number of people going to the museum. We have 12 people on the first bus, 24 on the second bus, 18 on the third bus, and 21 on the fourth bus. So, the total number of people is:

12 + 24 + 18 + 21 = 55

Answer: 55
