Let's break this down step by step.

Tina starts by putting in 20 coins during the first hour. That's 20 coins.

During the next two hours, Tina puts in 30 coins each time. That's 2 * 30 = 60 coins.

During the fourth hour, Tina puts in 40 coins. That's 40 coins.

Tina then takes out 20 coins, leaving her with:

20 + 60 + 40 - 20 = 100 coins.

Answer: 100
