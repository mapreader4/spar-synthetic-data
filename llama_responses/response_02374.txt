Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the number of employees who earn $12 per hour.

There are 200 employees who earn $12 per hour, so their total hourly wage is:

200 x $12 = $2400

Step 2: Calculate the number of employees who earn $14 per hour.

There are 40 employees who earn $14 per hour, so their total hourly wage is:

40 x $14 = $560

Step 3: Calculate the number of employees who earn $17 per hour.

All others earn $17 per hour, so the number of such employees is:

300 - 200 - 40 = 60

Their total hourly wage is:

60 x $17 = $1020

Step 4: Add up the total hourly wages of all employees.

The total hourly wage for the 200 employees earning $12 per hour is $2400. The total hourly wage for the 40 employees earning $14 per hour is $560. The total hourly wage for the 60 employees earning $17 per hour is $1020. Adding these up, we get:

$2400 + $560 + $1020 = $3080

The total cost to employ all employees for one 8-hour long shift is:

$3080.
