Let's break down the information we have:

1. His second throw skips 2 more times than his first.
2. His third throw skips twice as many times as his second.
3. His fourth throw skips 3 fewer times than his third throw.
4. His fifth throw skips one more time than the fourth throw.
5. His fifth throw skipped 8 times across the water.

From statement 5, we know his fifth throw skipped 8 times. From statement 4, we know his fifth throw skipped one more time than the fourth throw. This means his fourth throw skipped 7 times.

From statement 3, we know his fourth throw skipped 3 fewer times than his third throw. This means his third throw skipped 10 times.

From statement 2, we know his third throw skipped twice as many times as his second. This means his second throw skipped 5 times.

From statement 1, we know his second throw skipped 2 more times than his first. This means his first throw skipped 3 times.

Now, let's add up the number of skips for all his throws:

3 (first throw) + 5 (second throw) + 10 (third throw) + 7 (fourth throw) + 8 (fifth throw) = 33

Answer: 33
