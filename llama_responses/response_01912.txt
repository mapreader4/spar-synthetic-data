Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Each truck can carry a load of no more than 2,000 pounds of cargo.
* Some boxes weigh 10 pounds each, and some boxes weigh 40 pounds each.
* The customer has ordered equal quantities of both the lighter and heavier products.

Let's say the number of lighter boxes (10-pound boxes) is x. Then, the number of heavier boxes (40-pound boxes) is also x.

The total weight of the lighter boxes is 10x pounds, and the total weight of the heavier boxes is 40x pounds.

The total weight of the cargo in each truck is 2,000 pounds. The total weight of the lighter and heavier boxes is 10x + 40x = 50x pounds.

We can set up an equation to represent the total weight of the cargo in each truck:

50x = 2000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 50:

x = 2000 / 50

x = 40

So, Steven can ship 40 boxes of products in each delivery.
