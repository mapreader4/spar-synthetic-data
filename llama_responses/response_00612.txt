Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of green caps he has. We are given that Ali has 125 bottle caps. We are asked to find the percentage of green caps.

Let's call the number of green caps he has 'G'. Then, we can use the formula to find the percentage of green caps:

G / 125 =?

To find the percentage, we can multiply the number of green caps by 100 and then divide by 125:

G / 125 = 40

So, the percentage of green caps is 40%.

Answer: 40
