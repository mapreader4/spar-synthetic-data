Let's start by calculating the total weight of the books. The 70 hardcover books weigh 70 * 0.5 = 35 pounds. The 30 textbooks weigh 30 * 2 = 60 pounds. The 3 knick-knacks weigh 3 * 6 = 18 pounds. The total weight of the books is 35 + 60 + 18 = 113 pounds. The bookcase can hold 80 pounds, so the total weight of the collection is 113 - 80 = 23 pounds over the bookcase's weight limit.
