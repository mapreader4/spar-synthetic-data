Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total cost of visiting all 30 stadiums: 30 stadiums * $900 per stadium = $27,000.

Zach can save $1,500 per year, so let's divide the total cost by the amount he can save per year to find out how many years it will take him to reach his goal:

$27,000 รท $1,500 = 18 years

Answer: 18
