Let's break it down step by step.

Hank makes $100 in a carwash and donates 90% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. So, 90% of $100 is $90. So, Hank donates $90 to the local homeless shelter.

Hank makes $80 in a bake sale and donates 75% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. So, 75% of $80 is $60. So, Hank donates $60 to the local homeless shelter.

Hank makes $50 mowing lawns and donates 100% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. So, 100% of $50 is $50. So, Hank donates $50 to the local homeless shelter.

To find the total amount donated, we add the amounts together: $90 + $60 + $50 = $200.

Answer: 200
