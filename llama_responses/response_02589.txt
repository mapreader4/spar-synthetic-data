Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of adults. Since each of the 33 children ate 10 apples, that means that the total number of apples eaten by the children is 33 * 10 = 330.

The total number of apples eaten in total is 450. Since the adults ate 3 apples each, the number of apples eaten by the adults is 3 * unknown, which we will call x. So, the total number of apples eaten by the adults is 3x.

We know that the total number of apples eaten is 450, and we can set up the equation 3x + 330 = 450.

To solve for x, we can subtract 330 from both sides of the equation, which leaves us with 120.

So, x = 120.

Answer: 120
