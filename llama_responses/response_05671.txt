Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with Brooke's math problems. He can answer each math problem for 2 minutes, so the total time for the math problems is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's move on to the social studies problems. Brooke can answer each social studies problem in 30 seconds, so the total time for the social studies problems is 30 * 6 = 180 seconds = 3 minutes.

Now, let's add the time for the math problems and the social studies problems to find the total time for the homework.

The total time for the math problems is 30 minutes and the total time for the social studies problems is 3 minutes, so the total time for the homework is 30 + 3 = 33 minutes.

Finally, let's add the time for the science problems. Brooke can answer each science problem in 1.5 minutes, so the total time for the science problems is 1.5 * 10 = 15 minutes.

The total time for the homework is 33 minutes for the math and social studies problems and 15 minutes for the science problems. So, the total time for the homework is 33 + 15 = 48 minutes.

Answer: 48
