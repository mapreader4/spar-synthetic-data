Let's break this down step by step.

There were 3 cars, 6 taxis, and 2 vans. The number of people in each type of vehicle is:

* Cars: 4 people
* Taxis: 6 people
* Vans: 5 people

We can add the number of people in each type of vehicle to get the total number of people:
4 (cars) + 6 (taxis) + 2 (vans) = 12 people

So, the total number of people who went on the hike is 12.
