Let's break down the time it would take her to drive herself:

* 3 hours and 15 minutes = 3 x 60 + 15 = 195 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it would take her to take the airplane:

* Drive to the airport: 10 minutes
* Wait to board the plane: 20 minutes
* Flight time: 1/3 of 195 minutes = 65 minutes
* Get off the airplane and arrive at the interview site: 10 minutes

Total time to take the airplane: 10 + 20 + 65 + 10 = 105 minutes

Now, let's calculate the difference in time:

* Driving herself: 195 minutes
* Taking the airplane: 105 minutes

The difference in time is: 195 - 105 = 90 minutes

It would be 90 minutes faster for her to take the airplane.

Answer: 90
