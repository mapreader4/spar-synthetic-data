Let's break it down step by step.

Betty ordered 6 pieces of slippers that cost $2.5 each. So the total cost of the slippers is 6 x 2.5 = 15 dollars.

Betty also ordered 4 pieces of lipstick for $1.25 each. So the total cost of the lipstick is 4 x 1.25 = 5 dollars.

Betty also ordered 8 pieces of hair color for $3 each. So the total cost of the hair color is 8 x 3 = 24 dollars.

The total cost of all the items is 15 + 5 + 24 = 44 dollars. So Betty paid a total of 44 dollars.
