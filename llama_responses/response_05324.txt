Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total amount of money that Parker and Richie split. We know that the ratio is 2:3, so the total amount is 2x as much as Richie's share. So, Richie's share is 3x.

We know that Parker got $50, which is the smaller share. So, we can set up the equation: 50 = 2x + 3x.

To solve for x, we can subtract 50 - 3x from both sides of the equation to get 50 - 3x = 2x.

50 - 3x = 2x

2x = 50 - 15

2x = 35

x = 35/2
