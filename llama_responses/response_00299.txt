Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Basil gets 1/2 of a dog cookie in the morning, so she gets 1/2 of 45 cookies in the morning. 1/2 of 45 is 22.5 cookies. Then, she gets 2 whole cookies during the day, so she gets 2 cookies. 22.5 + 2 = 24.5 cookies.

Step 2: Basil gets 1/2 of a dog cookie in the morning and before bed. She gets 1/2 of 45 cookies before bed, so she gets 22.5 cookies.

Step 3: Basil needs 24.5 cookies for the day and 22.5 cookies for the night, so she needs 47 cookies in total for the day. 47 cookies is 47/3, so Basil needs 15.7 boxes of cookies to last her for 30 days.
