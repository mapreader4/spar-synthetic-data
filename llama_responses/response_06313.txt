Let's start by using a variable to represent Trevor's current age. Let's call it x.

Trevor's brother is 32 years old now. So, 20 years ago, his age would have been x - 20.

We know that 20 years ago, Trevor's brother was twice his age 20 years ago. So, his age 20 years ago would have been 2 * (x - 20).

We know that 20 years ago, Trevor's brother was 2 * (x - 20). So, x - 20 = 16.

So, 20 years ago, Trevor's brother was 16 years old.

Now, we know that 20 years ago, Trevor's brother was 16 years old. So, we can subtract 20 from 16 to find his current age, which is 32.

Answer: 32
