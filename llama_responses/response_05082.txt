Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of money she made from commercials. Since she makes $0.50 for every commercial that's viewed, and 100 people viewed the commercials, she made:

100 x $0.50 = $50

Next, let's find the amount of money she made from subscriptions. She makes $1.00 for every person who subscribes, and 27 people subscribed. So, she made:

27 x $1.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the amount of money she made from commercials and the amount of money she made from subscriptions:

$50 + $27.00 = $77.00

Answer: 77
