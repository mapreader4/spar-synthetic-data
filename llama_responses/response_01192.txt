Let's start by identifying the number of men and women at the party. We know that 1/3 of the 120 people are men, and half of the 120 people are women. So the number of men is 40 and the number of women is 60. Then, we know that the total number of children is the number of people remaining, which is 120 - 40 - 60 = 20. So, the number of children who attended the party is 20.
