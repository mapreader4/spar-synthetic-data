Let's break down the time needed to make the cakes into smaller parts:

1. Mixing the batter: 12 minutes
2. Baking the cakes: 9 minutes
3. Cooling and decorating the cakes: 6 minutes

So, the total time needed to make the cakes is 12 + 9 + 6 = 27 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 27 minutes รท 60 = 0.45 hours.

So, it will take Julia 0.45 hours to make all 6 cakes.
