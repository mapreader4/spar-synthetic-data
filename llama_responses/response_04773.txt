Let's start by subtracting the number of doctors and nurses that quit from the total number of doctors and nurses.

The total number of doctors is 11. The number of doctors that quit is 5, so there are 11 - 5 = 6 doctors left.

The total number of nurses is 18. The number of nurses that quit is 2, so there are 18 - 2 = 16 nurses left.

So, there are 6 doctors and 16 nurses left.
