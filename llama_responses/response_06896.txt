Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total amount of money they will earn from the apples:

They made 15 apples, and each apple is sold for $2. So, the total amount of money they will earn from the apples is:

15 x 2 = 30

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money they will earn from the grapes:

They made 12 grapes, and each grape is sold for $1.5. So, the total amount of money they will earn from the grapes is:

12 x 1.5 = 18

Now, let's add the total amount of money they will earn from the apples and the total amount of money they will earn from the grapes:

30 + 18 = 48

Answer: 48
