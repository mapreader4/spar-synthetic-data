Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find the interest charged by the loan shark in the first month. To do this, we need to find 10% of the original loan amount, which is $200. To find 10% of a number, we can multiply it by 0.10.

$200 x 0.10 = $20

So, the loan shark charges $20 in interest in the first month. This means that the total amount Jerry owes the loan shark after the first month is:

$200 (original loan) + $20 (interest) = $220

Now, we need to find the interest charged by the loan shark in the second month. To do this, we need to find 10% of the new total amount Jerry owes, which is $220.

$220 x 0.10 = $22

So, the loan shark charges $22 in interest in the second month.

Answer: 22
