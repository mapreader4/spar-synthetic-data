Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many pencils Antonio has.

Mitchell has 30 pencils. To find out how many pencils Antonio has, we can subtract the number of pencils Antonio has from the number of pencils Mitchell has.

Mitchell has 30 pencils. If Antonio has 6 fewer pencils than Mitchell, that means Antonio has 30 - 6 = 24 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Mitchell and Antonio have together.

Mitchell has 30 pencils. Antonio has 24 pencils. The total number of pencils they have together is the sum of the number of pencils they each have.

Mitchell has 30 pencils + Antonio has 24 pencils = 30 + 24 = 54 pencils.

Answer: 54
