Let's break this down step by step.

First, Sarah saves $5.00 a week for 4 weeks. That's a total of $5.00 x 4 = $20.00.

Then, she saves $10.00 a week for the next 4 weeks. That's a total of $10.00 x 4 = $40.00.

Then, she saves $20.00 a week for the next 4 weeks. That's a total of $20.00 x 4 = $80.00.

To find the total amount Sarah has saved over 12 weeks, we need to add the amounts together: $20.00 + $40.00 + $80.00 = $140.00.

Answer: 140
