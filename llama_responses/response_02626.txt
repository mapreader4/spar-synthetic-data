Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The cost of the slippers is $50.00, but they are 10% off. To find the discount, multiply the original price by 0.10: $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00. Then, subtract the discount from the original price: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

2. The embroidery will be $5.50 per shoe, so for both shoes, it will be $11.00 (2 x $5.50).

3. The shipping is a flat rate of $10.00.

4. To find the total cost, add the cost of the slippers, the embroidery, and the shipping: $45.00 + $11.00 + $10.00 = $66.00.
