Let's start by finding the ages of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fastest dogs.

The 2nd fastest dog is 2 years younger than the 1st fastest dog, so it's 10 - 2 = 8 years old.

The 3rd fastest dog is 4 years older than the 2nd fastest dog, so it's 8 + 4 = 12 years old.

The 4th fastest dog is half the age of the 3rd fastest dog, so it's 12 / 2 = 6 years old.

The 5th fastest dog is 20 years older than the 4th fastest dog, so it's 6 + 20 = 26 years old.

Now, let's find the average age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs.

The average age is (1st fastest dog's age + 5th fastest dog's age) / 2.

The 1st fastest dog is 10 years old, and the 5th fastest dog is 26 years old.

So, the average age is (10 + 26) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18.

Answer: 18
