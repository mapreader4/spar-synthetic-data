To solve this problem, we can start by finding the total number of liters of water that are mixed. We know that 3/5th of 20 liters of water are used, which is equal to 12 liters of water. We also know that 5/6th of 18 liters of vinegar are used, which is equal to 15 liters of vinegar.

Now, we can add the amount of water and vinegar together to find the total amount of the mixture. 12 liters of water + 15 liters of vinegar = 27 liters of the mixture.

Answer: 27
