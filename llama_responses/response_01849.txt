Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Let's calculate the distance Jennifer will travel to the museum that is 5 miles away from her home. She will travel 5 miles.

Step 2: Let's calculate the distance Jennifer will travel to the museum that is 15 miles away from her home. She will travel 15 miles.

Step 3: To find the total distance Jennifer will travel, we need to add the distance she will travel to the museum that is 5 miles away and the distance she will travel to the museum that is 15 miles away.

Step 4: Jennifer will travel 5 miles to the museum that is 5 miles away.

Step 5: Jennifer will travel 15 miles to the museum that is 15 miles away.

Step 6: To find the total distance Jennifer will travel, we add the distance she will travel to the museum that is 5 miles away and the distance she will travel to the museum that is 15 miles away. 5 + 15 = 20.
