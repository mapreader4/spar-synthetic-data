Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total cost of the pancakes. There were 60 stacks of pancakes, and each stack cost $4.00. So the total cost of the pancakes is 60 x $4.00 = $240.00.

Next, let's find the total cost of the bacon. There were 90 slices of bacon, and each slice costs $2.00. So the total cost of the bacon is 90 x $2.00 = $180.00.

Now, to find the total amount of money raised, we add the cost of the pancakes and the cost of the bacon: $240.00 + $180.00 = $420.00.

Answer: 420
