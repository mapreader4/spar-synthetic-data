Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the initial number of bees is x. Since the colony can contain up to 80000 individuals, we know that x is less than or equal to 80000.

The colony loses 1200 bees per day. Let's say the number of days it takes for the colony to reach a fourth of its initial number is t days.

We know that the number of bees in the colony after t days is x - 1200t.

We want to find the value of t such that x - 1200t = x/4.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

x - 1200t = x/4

To solve for t, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get:

4(x - 1200t) = x

Then, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation to get:

4t = x - 4800

To find the value of t, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

t = (x - 4800) / 4

Since we know that x is less than or equal to 80000, we can substitute this value into the equation to get:

t = (80000 - 4800) / 4

t = 7600 / 4

t = 1900

Answer: 1900
