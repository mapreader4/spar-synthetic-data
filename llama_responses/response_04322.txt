Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total distance they need to travel, which is 1200 miles.

Next, let's find the time it would take them to travel 1200 miles at 50 miles per hour. To do this, we can divide the total distance by the speed: 1200 miles รท 50 miles per hour = 24 hours.

Now, let's find the time it would take them to travel 1200 miles at 60 miles per hour. To do this, we can divide the total distance by the speed: 1200 miles รท 60 miles per hour = 20 hours.

Since they would travel 24 hours at 50 miles per hour, but 20 hours at 60 miles per hour, they will save 4 hours. So, the answer is:

Answer: 4
