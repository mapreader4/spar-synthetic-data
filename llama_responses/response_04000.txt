Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the distance Jenny's bottle cap travels.

Jenny's bottle cap flies 18 feet straight, then bounces off a street light and flies another 1/3 of the distance it already went.

The distance it already went is 18 feet, and 1/3 of 18 is 6 feet, so Jenny's bottle cap flies another 6 feet.

So, the total distance Jenny's bottle cap travels is 18 + 6 = 24 feet.

Next, let's find the distance Mark's bottle cap travels.

Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward, then bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did.

Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward, and twice as far is 2 x 15 = 30 feet.

So, the total distance Mark's bottle cap travels is 15 + 30 = 45 feet.

To find out how much further Mark's bottle cap goes than Jenny's, we subtract the distance Jenny's bottle cap travels from the distance Mark's bottle cap travels.

Mark's bottle cap travels 45 feet, and Jenny's bottle cap travels 24 feet. The difference is 45 - 24 = 21 feet.

So, Mark's bottle cap goes 21 feet further than Jenny's.

Answer: 21
