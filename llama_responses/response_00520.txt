Let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 25 layers of rock in the canyon's strata.
2. Five of the layers are limestone.
3. The remaining layers are 25 - 5 = 20.
4. Half of the remaining 20 layers are sandstone, which is 10.
5. Four of the remaining layers are quartz, which leaves 20 - 4 = 16.
6. Half of the remaining 16 layers are shale, which is 8.
7. The rest of the layers are 16 - 8 = 8.
8. The rest of the layers are 8, which are the different kinds of rock.

So, there are 8 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata.

Answer: 8
