Let's break this down step by step.

1. The original price of the medicine is $150.00.
2. There is a 10% cashback offer, which means 10% of the original price will be returned as cashback. To find the cashback amount, multiply the original price by 0.10:

$150.00 x 0.10 = $15.00

So, the cashback amount is $15.00.
3. There is also a $25.00 mail-in rebate for a 6-month prescription. This rebate is a fixed amount, not a percentage.

So, subtract the cashback and the rebate from the original price:

$150.00 - $15.00 (cashback) = $135.00
$135.00 - $25.00 (rebate) = $110.00

Answer: 110
