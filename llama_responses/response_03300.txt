Let's break it down step by step.

Ivory has 4 more riddles than Josh, so Josh has 4 - 1 = 3 riddles.

Taso has twice as many riddles as Ivory does. Since Ivory has 4 riddles, Taso has 4 x 2 = 8 riddles.

Adding the number of riddles that Josh and Taso have, we get 3 + 8 = 11 riddles.

Answer: 11
