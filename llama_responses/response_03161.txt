Let's break this down step by step.

Trevor started with 0 eggs. He got 4 eggs from Gertrude, so he now has 4 eggs. Then, he got 3 eggs from Blanche, so he now has 7 eggs.

Then, Nancy and Martha each laid 2 eggs, so Trevor got a total of 4 eggs from them. So, he now has 7 + 4 = 11 eggs.

On the way, Trevor dropped 2 eggs. So, he now has 11 - 2 = 9 eggs left.
