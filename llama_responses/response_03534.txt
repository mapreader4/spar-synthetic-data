Let's start by letting q be the number of quarters, d be the number of dimes, and n be the number of nickels.  We know that John has 3 more dimes than quarters, so we can write an equation: d = q + 3.  We also know that John has 6 fewer nickels than quarters, so we can write an equation: n = q - 6.  We know that John has 63 coins, so we can write an equation: q + d + n = 63.  We can substitute the equations we have to get a system of equations: q + q + 3 + q - 6 = 63.  We can add 6 to both sides of the equation to get: q + q = 69.  We can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get: q = 66.  So, John has 66 quarters.  Answer: 66.
