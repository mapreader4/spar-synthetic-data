Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Jimmy needs 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich has 2 slices of bread. So, the total number of slices of bread needed is 2 x 8 = 16.

Step 2: Each pack has 4 slices of bread. So, to get 16 slices, we need to divide 16 by 4.

16 รท 4 = 4

Answer: 4
