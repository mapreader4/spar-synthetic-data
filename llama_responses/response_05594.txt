Let's say Pam's current age is x. In 10 years, Rena will be 5 years older than Pam, so Rena's age in 10 years will be x + 5.

In 10 years, Pam will be 2x as old as Rena, so we can set up the equation 2x = x + 5. To solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get 2x - 5 = x. Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get x = 5.

So, Pam is currently 5 years old.
