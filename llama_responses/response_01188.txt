Let's break it down step by step.

1. Preston charges $5 for each sandwich, so for 18 sandwiches, he will charge 18 x $5 = 90 dollars.

2. Preston also charges $20 for a delivery fee. So, for 18 sandwiches, he will charge an additional 18 x $20 = 360 dollars.

3. The total amount he charges is 90 + 360 = 450 dollars.

4. 10% of that amount is 0.1 x 450 = 45 dollars.

5. 45 dollars is the amount Preston receives from the tip.

Answer: 450 - 45 = 405.
