Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the amount of money the investor will have in scheme A after a year:

Scheme A: The investor invested $300, and the scheme will yield 30% of the capital. To find the amount of money the investor will have in scheme A after a year, we can multiply the initial investment by the yield:

$300 (initial investment) x 0.3 (30% yield) = $90

So, the investor will have $90 in scheme A after a year.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money the investor will have in scheme B after a year:

Scheme B: The investor invested $200, and the scheme will yield 50% of the capital. To find the amount of money the investor will have in scheme B after a year, we can multiply the initial investment by the yield:

$200 (initial investment) x 0.5 (50% yield) = $100

So, the investor will have $100 in scheme B after a year.

Now, to find the difference between the amount of money the investor will have in scheme A and scheme B after a year, we subtract the amount in scheme B from the amount in scheme A:

$90 (amount in scheme A) - $100 (amount in scheme B) = -$10

The investor will have $10 less in scheme B than in scheme A after a year.
