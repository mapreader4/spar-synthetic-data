Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total volume of juice that the small bottles would hold.

The small bottles hold 6 ounces each, so for the same volume of juice, we need to know how many small bottles would be needed.

The big bottles hold 30 ounces, so we can set up a proportion to find the number of small bottles needed:

Let x be the number of small bottles needed.

30 ounces = 6 ounces * x

We can solve for x:

30 = 6x

x = 5

So we need 5 small bottles to get the same volume of juice.

Now, let's find the cost of 5 small bottles.

The small bottles cost 600 pesetas each, so the total cost would be:

5 * 600 = 3000 pesetas

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two options.

The big bottle costs 2700 pesetas and the 5 small bottles cost 3000 pesetas.

The difference is:

3000 - 2700 = 200 pesetas

So, by buying the big bottle, we would save 200 pesetas.

Answer: 200
