Let's think step by step.

Let's say the original price of the pair of shoes is x.

Since Lyra got a 20% discount, the price she paid is 80% of the original price. So, we can set up the equation:

0.8x = 480

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8:

x = 480 / 0.8

x = 600

So, the original price of the pair of shoes is 600.

Answer: 600
