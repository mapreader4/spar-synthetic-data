To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total cost of the tumblers, which is 10 tumblers for $45 each. This is 10 x 45 = 450.

Mrs. Petersons paid with 5 $100 bills, so we can start by dividing the total cost by the number of $100 bills. 450 / 100 = 4.5. Since Mrs. Petersons paid with 5 $100 bills, that means she paid 4 of those 100-dollar bills.

The remaining cost is 450 - 4 * 100 = 50. The remaining cost is 50 dollars.
