Let's start by identifying the variables. Let's call the cost of one little car $x. We know that the cost of the set of Legos is unknown. We know that the total amount of money earned is $45. We know that 3 little cars were sold, and one of them was sold for $5. So, we can set up an equation to solve for the cost of the set of Legos.

The equation would be: 3 * x + 3 * 5 + cost of the set of Legos = 45.

Since we know the cost of one little car is $5, we can substitute that into the equation:

3 * x + 3 * 5 + cost of the set of Legos = 45

Subtracting 3 * 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:

3 * x + cost of the set of Legos = 40

Subtracting 3 from both sides again, we get:

cost of the set of Legos = 40 - 3
