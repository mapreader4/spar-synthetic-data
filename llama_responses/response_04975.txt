Let's break it down step by step.

Angela had 24 pieces of action figures initially.

She sold off a quarter of them, which is 24 / 4 = 6. So she has 24 - 6 = 18 left.

She gave one-third of the remainder, which is 18 / 3 = 6, to her daughter. So she gave away 6 figures.

To find out how many figures she has left, we subtract the 6 she gave away from the 18 she had: 18 - 6 = 12.

Answer: 12
