Let's break it down step by step:

1. Carter scores 4 goals per game, so his average score is 4.
2. Shelby scores half as many as Carter, which is 2 goals per game.
3. Judah scores three less than twice as many goals as Shelby, so Judah scores 2 * 2 - 3 = 2 goals per game.
4. The total average score is the sum of the scores of the three teammates: 4 + 2 + 2 = 8.

Answer: 8
