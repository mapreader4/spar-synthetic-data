Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, the colony has some unknown number of penguins. Let's call this number x.

In the first year, the colony doubles in size, so the number of penguins becomes 2x.

In the second year, the colony triples in size, so the number of penguins becomes 3(2x) = 6x.

In the third year, the colony gains 129 penguins, so the total number of penguins becomes 6x + 129.

We are given that the colony has 1077 penguins now, so we can set up the equation:

6x + 129 = 1077

Subtract 129 from both sides:

6x = 948

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 158

So, the colony had 158 penguins at the beginning of the first year.

Now, let's calculate how many fish the colony caught per day. Each penguin eats 1.5 fish per day, and there are 158 penguins. The total number of fish eaten per day is:

158 penguins * 1.5 fish/penguin = 237 fish

Answer: 237
