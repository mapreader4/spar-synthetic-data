Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Ivan has a feeder that holds 2 cups of birdseed.
2. Each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds.
3. Ivan has to refill the feeder every week.
4. Ivan has to deal with a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed every week.

Let's use variables to represent the number of birds Ivan's feeder can feed in one week. Let's call this variable x.

The total amount of birdseed Ivan's feeder can feed in one week is 2 cups * 14 = 28.

However, Ivan has to deal with the squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed every week. So, the squirrel steals 1/2 cup of birdseed every week. This means that Ivan has to refill the feeder by 1 1/2 cups of birdseed every week.

So, the total number of birds Ivan's feeder can feed in one week is 28 - 1 1/2 = 26 3/4.

Answer: 26 3/4
