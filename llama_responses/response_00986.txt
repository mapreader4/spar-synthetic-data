Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of times they went swimming in a month.

Camden went swimming 16 times, and Susannah went swimming 24 times, so the total number of times they went swimming in a month is 16 + 24 = 40 times.

Since they went swimming for 4 weeks, we can divide the total number of times they went swimming by 4 to find the number of times they went swimming per week.

40 divided by 4 is 10. So, they went swimming 10 times per week.

Camden went swimming 16 times, and Susannah went swimming 24 times. We want to find out how many more times Susannah went swimming than Camden.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of times Camden went swimming from the number of times Susannah went swimming. 24 - 16 = 8. So, Susannah went swimming 8 more times than Camden.

Answer: 8
