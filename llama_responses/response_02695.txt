To find the total time spent with the dog, we must first find the time spent giving the dog a bath and half as long blow-drying. The time spent giving the dog a bath is 20 minutes. The time spent blow-drying the dog is half as long as the time spent giving the dog a bath, which is 20 minutes. So the time spent blow-drying the dog is 10 minutes. The total time spent giving the dog a bath and half as long blow-drying is 20 + 10 = 30 minutes. Then, Marcus takes the dog for a walk along a 3-mile trail. The time it takes him to walk 3 miles at a rate of 6 miles per hour is 3 / 6 = 0.5 hours. So the total time spent with the dog is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours. The answer is: Answer: 1.5
