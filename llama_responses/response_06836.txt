Let's break it down step by step:

Let's say Darius scored x points. Since Marius scored 3 points more than Darius, Marius scored x + 3 points.

Since Darius scored 5 points less than Matt, Matt scored x + 5 points.

The total points scored by all three friends is the sum of their individual scores: x + (x + 3) + (x + 5).

We know that Darius scored 10 points, so we can set up the equation as follows:

x + (x + 3) + (x + 5) = 10

We can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

2x + 8 = 10

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:

2x = 2

Multiply both sides by 1 to get:

x = 1

So, Darius scored 1 point.

The total points scored by all three friends is the sum of their individual scores: 1 + (1 + 3) + (1 + 5) = 10.

Answer: 10
