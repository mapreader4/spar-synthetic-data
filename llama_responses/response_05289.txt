Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find out how many papers John is supposed to deliver in total. He doesn't deliver them for 10 weeks, and he delivers 250 papers a day. So, the total number of papers is:

250 papers/day * 7 days/week * 10 weeks = 1750 papers

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the papers. The Monday-Saturday papers weigh 8 ounces each, and the Sunday paper weighs twice as much, which is 16 ounces. The total weight of a week's worth of papers is:

(6 * 8) + 16 = 64 ounces/week

John delivers 1750 papers in 10 weeks, so the total weight of all the papers is:

1750 papers * 64 ounces/papers * 10 weeks = 112000 ounces

Now, one ton is equal to 20000 ounces, so we need to convert the total weight to tons:

112000 ounces / 20000 ounces/ton = 5.6 tons

Finally, one ton of paper recycles for $20, so John made:

5.6 tons * 20 = 112

Answer: 112
