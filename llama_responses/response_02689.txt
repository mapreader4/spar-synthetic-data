We know that Devin taught Calculus for 4 years. He taught Algebra for twice as many years as Calculus. So he taught Algebra for 8 years. He taught Statistics for 5 times as long as he taught Algebra. 5 * 8 = 40, so Devin taught Statistics for 40 years. Devin taught 4 + 8 + 40 = 52 years. Devin taught 52 years.
