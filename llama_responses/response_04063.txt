Let's break this down step by step.

1. The problem says 6 customers order the big stack, which has 5 pancakes each. So, Hank needs to make 6 x 5 = 30 big pancakes.

2. The problem also says 9 customers order the short stack, which has 3 pancakes each. So, Hank needs to make 9 x 3 = 27 short stack pancakes.

3. To make 30 big pancakes for the big stack and 27 short stack pancakes, Hank needs to make a total of 30 + 27 = 57 pancakes.

Answer: 57
