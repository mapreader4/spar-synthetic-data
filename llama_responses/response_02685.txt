Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The daily rate is $125.00, and they are renting for 2 weeks, so the total cost of the rental is:

125 * 14 = 1750.00

2. There is a $100.00 pet fee, so we need to add this to the total cost:

1750.00 + 100.00 = 1850.00

3. There is a 20% service/cleaning fee, so we need to calculate 20% of the total cost:

0.20 * 1850.00 = 370.00

4. They need to pay 50% of the entire bill, so we need to calculate 50% of the total cost:

0.50 * 1850.00 = 925.00

The security deposit is $925.00.
