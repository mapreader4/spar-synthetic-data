Let's break down the total distance traveled by day:

Day 1: 135 miles
Day 2: 135 + 124 = 259 miles
Day 3: 259 + 159 = 418 miles
Day 4: 418 + 189 = 607 miles

The total distance traveled is 135 + 259 + 418 + 189 = 902 miles.

To find out how many times she charged her phone, we need to divide the total distance by the distance she can travel on a full charge, which is 106 miles. 

The total distance divided by the distance she can travel on a full charge is 902 รท 106 = 8.53. Since she can't charge her phone half of a mile, we round up to the nearest whole number of times she charged her phone. Therefore, she charged her phone 9 times.

Answer: 9
