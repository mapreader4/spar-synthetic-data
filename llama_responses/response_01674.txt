Let's break this problem down step by step.

John buys 1.5 ounces of silver, which costs $20 per ounce.  So, he spends 1.5 x 20 = 30 dollars on silver.

John buys twice as much gold, which is 2 x 1.5 ounces.  So, he buys 3 ounces of gold.  Gold is 50 times more expensive per ounce, so he spends 3 x 50 = 150 dollars on gold.

The total cost of his purchases is 30 + 150 = 180 dollars.
