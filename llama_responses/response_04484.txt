Let's break this problem down step by step.

Diego's monthly income is $5,000.
Diego's monthly expenses are $4,600.

To find out how much Diego saves, we can subtract his monthly expenses from his monthly income.

$5,000 (monthly income) - $4,600 (monthly expenses) = $400

Diego saves $400 each month.

To find out how much he saves over a year, we multiply his monthly savings by 12.

$400 (monthly savings) * 12 (months) = $4,800

Diego saves $4,800 over the course of a year.

Answer: 4800
