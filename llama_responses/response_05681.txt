Let's start by identifying the number of red bouncy balls Jill bought. She bought 5 packs of red bouncy balls, and each pack has 18 bouncy balls. So, the total number of red bouncy balls is 5 x 18 = 90.

Next, let's identify the number of yellow bouncy balls Jill bought. She bought 4 packs of yellow bouncy balls, and each pack has 18 bouncy balls. So, the total number of yellow bouncy balls is 4 x 18 = 72.

To find the difference between the number of red bouncy balls and the number of yellow bouncy balls, we subtract 72 from 90. 90 - 72 = 18.

Answer: 18
