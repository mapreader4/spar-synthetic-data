Let's break down the cost of the items Lauren bought:

* 2 pounds of hamburger meat: 2 x $3.50 = $7.00
* 1 pack of hamburger buns: $1.50
* 1 head of lettuce: $1.00
* 1.5-pound tomato: 1.5 x $2.00 = $3.00
* Jar of pickles: $2.50 (minus $1.00 coupon) = $1.50

Total cost: $7.00 + $1.50 + $1.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 = $14.00

Lauren paid with a $20 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $20 bill:

$20 - $14.00 = $6.00
