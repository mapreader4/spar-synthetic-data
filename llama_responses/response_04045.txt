To find the total time Laura spent in the park, we need to calculate the total time she spent walking to and from the park. 2 hours is 120 minutes. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. So, the total time spent walking is 1.5 hours. 

Since she took 6 trips, we need to multiply the total time spent walking by 6 to get the total time spent walking for all the trips. 1.5 hours times 6 is 9 hours. 

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total time spent walking out of the total time for the trips. 9 hours out of the total time taken for the trips is 9 hours out of 12 hours. 

9 hours out of 12 hours is 0.75.
