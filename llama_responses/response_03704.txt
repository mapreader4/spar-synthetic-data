Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

* The store sold 327 televisions on Black Friday this year.
* They sold 50 more than they sold last Black Friday, so they sold 327 televisions last Black Friday.
* The trend continues, so they will sell 50 more televisions each year for 3 years.

To find the total number of televisions they will sell in 3 years, we need to multiply the 50 additional televisions sold each year by 3.

50 x 3 = 150

So, the store will sell 150 more televisions each year for 3 years. To find the total number of televisions they will sell in 3 years, we need to multiply 150 by 3.

150 x 3 = 450

Answer: 450
