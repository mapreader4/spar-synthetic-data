Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Hakimi's age is x.

Since Molly's age is 30, Jared's age is 10 years older than Hakimi's age. So, Jared's age is x + 10.

The total average age of the three friends is 40. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + 30 = 40

To solve for x, we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x + (x + 10) = 40 - 30
x + 10 = 10

Now, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 10

So, Hakimi's age is 10 years old.
