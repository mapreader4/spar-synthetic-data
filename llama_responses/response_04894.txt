Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of students in each grade:

* 3rd grade: 19 students
* 4th grade: 19 x 2 = 38 students
* 2nd grade: 19 students

Now, let's add up the number of students in each grade:

19 + 38 + 19 =?

To find the total number of students, I will add the numbers:

19 + 38 + 19 = 76

Answer: 76
