Let's break this problem down step by step.

Harrison buys a regular croissant on Saturdays for $3.50, so that is his weekly cost for croissants.  There are 52 Saturdays in a year, so the total cost of croissants in a year would be 52 x 3.50 = 182.00.

Harrison also buys an almond croissant for $5.50 on Sundays.  He buys one almond croissant per week, so the total cost of almond croissants in a year would be 52 x 5.50 = 284.00.

The total cost of all croissants and almond croissants in a year would be 182.00 + 284.00 = 466.00.

So, the answer is: Answer: 466.
