Let's break this down step by step.

Isabel had $204 in her piggy bank.

She spent half the amount, which is $102.

So, she had $102 left.

Then, she spent half of the remaining money, which is half of $102, which is $51.

So, she spent $51.

Now, she has $51 left.

The amount left is $51.

Answer: 51
