Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Jason's grade is x.

Jenny's grade is 95.

Bob's grade is 25 points less than Jenny's, so it is 95 - 25 = 70.

Bob's grade is half of Jason's grade, so it is x / 2.

We know that Jenny's grade is 95, so x / 2 = 95.

x / 2 = 95 -> x = 95 * 2 = 190.

Bob's grade is 70.
