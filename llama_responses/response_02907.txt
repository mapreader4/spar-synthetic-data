We know that 70% of the trees are pine trees. Let's call the number of pine trees "x". Then, we know that the total number of trees is 350. So, we can set up an equation: 0.7x = 350. Then we solve for x. 0.7x = 350. x = 350 / 0.7. x = 500. So, the number of trees that are not pine trees is 500 - 350 = 150. So, the answer is 150.
