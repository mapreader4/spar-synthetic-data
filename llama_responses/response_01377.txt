Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by letting d be the number of ducks Adelaide bought.

Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, so Ephraim bought 45 + 1 = 46 ducks.

Adelaide bought twice the number of ducks Ephraim bought, so Adelaide bought 46 * 2 = 92 ducks.

Kolton bought the remaining number of ducks, which is 30.

To find the average number of ducks the three bought, we add the number of ducks each bought:

92 + 46 + 30 = 168

Answer: 168
