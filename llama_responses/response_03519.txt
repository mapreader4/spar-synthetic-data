To find the cost per person, we need to find the total cost of the ice cream bars and then divide it by the number of people who want to eat. 

The total cost of the ice cream bars is 3 bars. The cost per bar is $7.50. So the total cost is 3 x $7.50 = $22.50. 

The 6 friends want to eat 2 bars each. So, we need to divide the total cost by 6. 

22.50 / 6 = 3.75

Answer: 3.75
