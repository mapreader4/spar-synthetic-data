Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the given information:

* The Dark Lord needs to transport 1200 pounds of swords.
* He has 10 squads of 8 orcs each.

To find the total number of orcs, we multiply the number of squads by the number of orcs per squad: 10 squads x 8 orcs = 80 orcs.

Now, we need to find the weight of swords each orc needs to carry. To do this, we divide the total weight of swords by the number of orcs: 1200 pounds รท 80 orcs = 15 pounds per orc.

So, each orc needs to carry 15 pounds of swords.

Answer: 15
