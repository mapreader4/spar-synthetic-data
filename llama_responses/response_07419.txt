Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Corey has x candies. Since Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey, Tapanga has x + 8 candies. We know that Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies in total, so we can set up an equation.

Tapanga's candies + Corey's candies = 66

Tapanga's candies = x + 8
Corey's candies = x

We can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:

x + 8 = 66 - 8
x = 58

So, Corey has 58 candies.
