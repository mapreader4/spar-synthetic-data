Let's break this problem down step by step.

Hershel initially has 10 betta fish and 15 goldfish.

Bexley brings him 2/5 times as many betta fish, so that's 2/5 * 10 = 4 betta fish. Bexley also brings 1/3 times as many goldfish, so that's 1/3 * 15 = 5 goldfish.

So, the total number of betta fish Hershel now has is 10 + 4 = 14. The total number of goldfish he has is 15 + 5 = 20.

Hershel gifts his sister 1/2 of the fish, which is 1/2 * 14 = 7 betta fish and 1/2 * 20 = 10 goldfish.

So, the total number of fish Hershel has remaining in the bowl is 14 - 7 = 7 betta fish and 20 - 10 = 10 goldfish.
