Let's break down the problem step by step.

Pat's password is a string of eight characters. It's made up of several kinds of alphanumeric and symbol characters for security.

1. It starts with a string of eight random lowercase letters.
2. The length of the string is half, which means it's four letters long.
3. The string is half is made up of alternating upper case letters and numbers.
4. There's one symbol on each end of the password.

Let's count the characters in the password:

* 8 lowercase letters in the beginning (8)
* 4 letters in the middle (half of 8)
* 1 symbol on each end (2 symbols)

So, the total number of characters in the password is 8 + 4 + 2 = 14.
