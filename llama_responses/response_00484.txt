Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of people on the team initially.

Leticia, Nina, and Rosalie have a total of 25 people on their dance team.

Now, 8 people quit.

To find the new total number of people on the team, we need to subtract the 8 people who quit from the initial total.

25 - 8 = 17

So, there are 17 people left on the team after 8 people quit.
