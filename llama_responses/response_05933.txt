Let's start by identifying the total value of the bills Marly has. She has 10 $20 bills, which is 10 x 20 = 200. She also has 8 $10 bills, which is 8 x 10 = 80. And she has 4 $5 bills, which is 4 x 5 = 20. The total value of the bills Marly has is 200 + 80 + 20 = 300. Since she wants to change her bills to $100 bills, we need to find out how many $100 bills she needs. Since $100 is equal to 3 x 100 = 300, Marly needs 3 $100 bills to change her bills to $100 bills.
