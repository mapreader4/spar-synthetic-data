Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by letting Phoebe's current age be x. Then, we know that Rehana is 25 years old. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

x + 5 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

x = 20

Now, we know that Jacob is 3/5 of Phoebe's current age, so we can set up another equation:

Jacob = 3/5 * 20

To solve for Jacob's current age, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

Jacob = 12

So, Jacob is currently 12 years old.

Answer: 12
