Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of students who play basketball and volleyball.

Half of the students play basketball, which is 20 / 2 = 10 students.

Two-fifths of the students play volleyball, which is 20 * 2/5 = 8 students.

One-tenth of the students play both basketball and volleyball, which is 20 * 1/10 = 2 students.

To find the total number of students who play basketball or volleyball, we add the number of students who play basketball and volleyball: 10 + 8 = 18.

To find the number of students who do not play either game, we subtract the total number of students who play a game from the total number of students in the class, 20. 20 - 18 = 2.
