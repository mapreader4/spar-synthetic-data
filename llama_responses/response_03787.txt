Let's break this down step by step.

Jason joined the military when he was 18 years old. He took 8 years to reach the rank of chief. So, he was 18 + 8 = 26 years old when he became a chief.

Then, it took him 25% longer than that to go from chief to master chief. 25% of 8 years is 2 years, so it took him 8 + 2 = 10 years to go from chief to master chief.

He then spent 10 more years in the military before retiring. So, he spent a total of 26 + 10 = 36 years in the military.

He was 18 + 36 = 54 years old when he retired.
