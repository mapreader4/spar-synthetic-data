Maisie dropped off 33 flyers. Donna took the long right street, which is twice as long as the short left street. So, if Maisie dropped off 33 flyers on the short street, Donna would drop off 66 flyers on the long street. But she actually dropped off 5 more than twice as many flyers, which would be 60. So, Donna dropped off 60 - 5 = 55 flyers. 

Answer: 55
