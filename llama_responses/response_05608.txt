Let's start by using the information that Carl went home with 18 watermelons. This means that he sold 18 watermelons during the day. Since he made a profit of 105 dollars, we can say that the total amount of money he received from selling watermelons is 105 dollars. Let's call this value x. Then, we can set up an equation: 3x = 105. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which gives us x = 35. This means that Carl started out with 35 watermelons.
