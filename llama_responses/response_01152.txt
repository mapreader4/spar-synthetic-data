Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the initial number of students per class, which is 20 students.

There are 15 classes initially. If they add 5 more classes, the total number of classes is now 15 + 5 = 20.

The total number of students is the total number of students per class multiplied by the total number of classes. So, the total number of students is 20 * 20 = 400.

Answer: 400
