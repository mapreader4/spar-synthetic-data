Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the sum of the scores Randy got in his first four quizzes.

90 + 98 + 92 + 94 = 374

Next, we need to find the average of these scores. To do this, we divide the sum by the number of quizzes.

374 รท 4 = 93.5

Randy wants a 94 average, so we need to find the score that will bring his average to 94.

94 - 93.5 = 0.5

To get a 0.5 above 93.5, Randy needs to get a score of 95 in the 5th quiz.

Answer: 95
