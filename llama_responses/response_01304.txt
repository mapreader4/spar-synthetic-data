Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The store sells to 35 customers in the first week, so Julio earns a commission of $1 for each customer, which is 35 x $1 = $35.
2. In the second week, the store sells to twice as many customers, which is 35 x 2 = 70 customers. Julio earns a commission of $1 for each customer, which is 70 x $1 = $70.
3. In the third week, the store sells to triple the number of customers in the first week, which is 35 x 3 = 105 customers. Julio earns a commission of $1 for each customer, which is 105 x $1 = $105.
4. The total commission earned in the 3 weeks is the sum of the commissions earned in each week: $35 + $70 + $105 = $210.
5. Julio also receives a salary of $500 for the 3 weeks.
6. He also receives a bonus of $50.

To find the total amount Julio earns, we add the total commission and the salary and bonus: $210 + $500 + $50 = $760.

Answer: 760
