Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the clothes Carrie buys. The cost of the shirts is 4 x 8 = 32. The cost of the pants is 2 x 18 = 36. The cost of the jackets is 2 x 60 = 120. The total cost of the clothes is 32 + 36 + 120 = 188.

Since Carrie's mom pays for half of the total cost, we need to find half of 188. Half of 188 is 188 / 2 = 94.

So, Carrie pays 94 for the clothes.
