Let's start by letting x be the number of goldfish the pet store sold.

The pet store can buy a goldfish for $.25 and sell it for $.75, so the profit from selling a goldfish is $.50. The pet store wants to use the profits from goldfish sales to buy a new tank, which costs $100. The pet store is 45% short of the price, so the amount of money needed is $55.

The amount of money needed to buy the tank is $55, so we need to find the amount of goldfish sold to get that amount.

Let's set up an equation:

$.50 * x = $55

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by $.50:

x = $55 / $.50 = 110

So the pet store sold 110 goldfish that week.
