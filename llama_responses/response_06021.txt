Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Harry has already been sat on the bus for 15 minutes. Then, the rest of the journey will take 25 minutes. The walk from the bus stop to his house will take half the amount of time the bus journey took, which is 15 minutes. 

So, the total time spent traveling is 15 minutes plus 25 minutes plus half of 15 minutes. To find half of 15 minutes, I will divide 15 by 2, which is 7.5 minutes. 

So, the total time spent traveling is 15 + 25 + 7.5 = 46.5 minutes. 

Answer: 46.5
