Let's break it down step by step.

1. The three companies purchased 3 ad spaces, and each ad space has a size of 12 feet by 5 feet, so the total area of the ad space is 12 * 5 = 60 square feet.

2. Each square foot ad was charged at $60, so the cost of the ad space is 60 * 60 = $3600.

3. Since there are 3 ad spaces, the total cost is 3600 * 3 = $10800.

Answer: 10800
