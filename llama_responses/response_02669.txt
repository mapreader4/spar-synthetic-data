Let's break it down step by step.

Beatrice looked at 8 TVs at the first store, so that's 8 TVs.

Then, she looked at 3 times as many TVs as the 8 TVs at the second store, which means she looked at 3 * 8 = 24 TVs.

Finally, she looked at more TVs on the auction site, which means we need to add that to the total number of TVs she looked at.

So, the total number of TVs Beatrice looked at is 8 + 24 + x. We can simplify this by combining the constants 8 and 24: 8 + 24 = 32. So, we need to add x to 32.

The problem states that she looked at 42 TVs in all, so we can set up an equation: 32 + x = 42. To solve for x, we can subtract 32 from both sides: x = 42 - 32. This gives us x = 10.

So, the answer is: Answer: 10.
