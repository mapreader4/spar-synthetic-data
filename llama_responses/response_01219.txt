Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that a Fried Chicken Dinner uses 8 pieces of chicken, and Victor has 2 such orders, so that's a total of 2 x 8 = 16 pieces of chicken.

Next, we know that a Chicken Pasta order uses 2 pieces of chicken, and Victor has 6 such orders, so that's a total of 6 x 2 = 12 pieces of chicken.

Finally, we know that a Barbecue Chicken order uses 3 pieces of chicken, and Victor has 3 such orders, so that's a total of 3 x 3 = 9 pieces of chicken.

To find the total number of pieces of chicken Victor needs, we add up the number of pieces from each type of order: 16 (Fried Chicken Dinner) + 12 (Chicken Pasta) + 9 (Barbecue Chicken) = 37.

Answer: 37
