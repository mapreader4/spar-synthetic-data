Ernie's income is 4/5 of what it used to be. Jack's income is now twice what Ernie used to make. Let's call Ernie's original income x. Then, Jack's income is 2x.

We know that 4/5 of x is equal to Ernie's current income. So, Ernie's current income is (4/5) * x. We are also given that Ernie's current income is 4/5 of what it used to be, so we know that 4/5 * x = x. We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5/4:

(4/5) * x = x
(4/5) * x = 4/5 * x
x = x

So, Ernie's current income is 4/5 of what it used to be, which is equal to 4/5 * x. Now, we are given that Jack's income is now twice what Ernie used to make, which is 2x. We can set up an equation using this information:

Ernie's current income = 4/5 * x
Jack's income = 2 * x

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

Ernie's current income / 2 = x
Jack's income / 2 = x

Ernie's current income / 2 = x = 4/5 * x / 2
Ernie's current income / 2 = 4/5 * x / 2
x = 6000

So, Ernie used to make $6000.

Ernie's current income = 4/5 * x = 4/5 * 1200 = 4800
Jack's income = 2 * x = 2 * 1200 = 2400

Ernie and Jack's combined income is 4800 + 2400 = 7200.

Answer: 7200
