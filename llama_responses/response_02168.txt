Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The president started with $10,000 in campaign funds.
2. 40% of this amount is 40% of $10,000, which is $4,000.
3. 30% of the remaining amount is 30% of $6,000, which is $1,800.
4. The rest of the funds are from his own savings for the election.

To find the amount of money he saved, we add the two amounts: $4,000 and $1,800. $4,000 + $1,800 = $5,800.

So, the answer is: Answer: 5800
