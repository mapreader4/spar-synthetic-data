Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Jerry's initial debt was $50.

Two months ago, he paid $12, which means his debt decreased by $12.

Last month, he paid $3 more, so his debt decreased by $3.

To find out how much he has left to pay, we need to subtract the total amount he paid from the initial debt.

$50 - $12 - $3 = $35

Answer: 35
