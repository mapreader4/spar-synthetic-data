To find out how many weeks the 40 chocolate eggs will last, we can divide the number of chocolate eggs by the number of chocolate eggs Maddy eats each day.

Maddy eats 2 chocolate eggs each day, so the number of days she eats in a week is 2 * 7 = 14.

Now, we can divide the total number of chocolate eggs by the number of days Maddy eats them in a week:

40 รท 14 = 2.86

Maddy will last 2.86 weeks.
