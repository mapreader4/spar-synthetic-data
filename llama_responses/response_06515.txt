The cost of staying at High Services Hotel is $40 per night per person. The number of people staying is 3, so the total cost for the first night would be 3 x 40 = 120. For the second night, it would be 3 x 40 = 120. For the third night, it would be 3 x 40 = 120. The total cost would be 120 + 120 + 120 = 360. So the total amount of money they paid together would be 360.
