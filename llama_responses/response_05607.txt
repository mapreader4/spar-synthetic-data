Let's break it down step by step.

Johnny worked for 3 hours at $7 per hour, so he made 3 x 7 = 21 dollars. He also worked for 2 hours at $10 an hour, so he made 2 x 10 = 20 dollars. And he worked for 4 hours at $12 an hour, so he made 4 x 12 = 48 dollars.

So, his total earnings for the first day are 21 + 20 + 48 = 89 dollars.

He repeated this process for 5 days, so he made 5 x 89 = 445 dollars.
