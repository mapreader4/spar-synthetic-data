Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first identify the information given:

1. The journey from New Orleans to New York took 3/4 the time it takes to travel from New York to San Francisco.
2. The journey from New York to San Francisco took some time, but we don't know what that time is.
3. Sue lands in San Francisco 24 hours after departing from New York.
4. She lands in San Francisco 16 hours after landing in New York.

Let's represent the time it takes to travel from New Orleans to New York as x. Then, the time it takes to travel from New York to San Francisco is 3x.

The equation is as follows:

x + 3x = 16

We can solve for x by subtracting 3x from both sides:

x + 3x = 16
x = 16 - 3x
x = 16 / 4
x = 4

Now, we know the time it takes to travel from New Orleans to New York is 4 hours. The total time Sue took to reach San Francisco is the sum of the time it takes to travel from New Orleans to New York and the time she lands in San Francisco:

4 + 24 =?

Add 4 and 24:

4 + 24 = 28

So, the total time Sue took to reach San Francisco is 28 hours.
