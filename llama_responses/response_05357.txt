Let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom gets 10 points for killing one enemy.
2. For killing at least 100 enemies, he gets a 50% bonus to his score. So, he gets 50 points for killing 100 enemies.
3. He killed 150 enemies in total, which is 50 more than the 100 enemies needed for the bonus.
4. So, he gets the bonus points for the 50 enemies he killed above the 100 enemies needed for the bonus. That's 50 points.
5. He got 10 points for each of the 150 enemies he killed. So, his total score is 10 x 150 = 1500 points.
6. Then, he got the 50 points for the bonus. So, his total score is 1500 + 50 = 1550.

Answer: 1550
