Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of days in 3 weeks:

3 weeks = 21 days

Since Flora needs to drink 105 gallons of milk in total, and she thinks she can drink 3 gallons daily, we can find the number of days it would take her to finish the milk by dividing 105 by 3:

105 รท 3 = 35

So, it would take Flora 35 days to finish the milk if she drinks 3 gallons daily.

Since she has 21 days in 3 weeks, and it would take her 35 days to finish the milk, we can subtract 35 from 21 to find the number of extra days she needs to drink more milk:

35 - 21 = 14

So, Flora needs to drink more milk for 14 days to fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement. To find the number of gallons she needs to drink daily, we can divide 14 by 1:

14 รท 1 = 14

Answer: 14
