Let's start by finding the age of Tom. Bob is 11 years old, and Arthur is 3 years younger than Bob. So, Arthur is 11 - 3 = 8 years old.

Then, Susan is 15 years old, and Arthur is 8 years old. So, Susan is 15 - 8 = 7 years older than Arthur.

To find the total age of the four family members, we add their ages: 11 + 15 + 8 + 7 = 31.

Answer: 31
