Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Blake spends $40 on oranges.
2. He also spends $50 on apples.
3. He also spends $60 on mangoes.

To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the three items:

$40 + $50 + $60 = $150

Blake has $300. We need to subtract the total amount spent from the initial $300:

$300 - $150 = $150

So, the change he was given is:

Answer: 150
