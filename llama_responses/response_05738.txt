Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: the team has 40 players, 3 goalies, 10 defenders, and the rest are midfielders and strikers.

We know that the team has 10 defenders. Since the team has twice as many midfielders as defenders, that means there are 10/2 = 20 midfielders.

The team has 40 players in total. We know that the 10 defenders, 20 midfielders, and the rest are strikers. So, the number of strikers is 40 - 10 - 20 = 10.

Answer: 10
