Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that the total number of hot dog buns Mr. Gates bought is 30.
We know that he has 4 classes, each with 30 students.

To find out how many hot dog buns each student can get, we need to divide the total number of hot dog buns by the number of students.

So, let's divide 30 (total hot dog buns) by 4 (number of classes) to get:

30 รท 4 = 7.5

Since we can't give a fraction of a hot dog bun, we round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, the answer is 7.

Answer: 7
