Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the machine makes 6 turns in 30 seconds. So, to find the number of turns it makes in 2 hours, we can multiply the number of turns per 30 seconds by the number of 30 seconds in 2 hours.

There are 2 hours = 120 seconds, so we can multiply 6 turns per 30 seconds by 120 seconds.

6 * 120 = 720.

Answer: 720
