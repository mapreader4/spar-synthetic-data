Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with 320 ducks.

On the first night, 1/4 of the ducks get eaten by the fox. That means 80 ducks are eaten.

The remaining ducks are 240.

On the second night, 1/6 of the remaining ducks fly away. 40 ducks fly away.

The remaining ducks are 200.

On the third night, 30 percent of the remaining ducks are stolen. 30% of 200 is 60 ducks.

So, the remaining ducks are 140.

Answer: 140
