Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many jars of jam she packs in each box.

Cassy packs 12 jars of jam in 10 boxes, so she packs 12/10 = 1.2 jars of jam in each box. Similarly, she packs 10 jars of jam in 30 boxes, so she packs 10/30 = 0.33 jars of jam in each box.

Now, let's find the total number of jars of jam she packs in all the boxes. In the 10 boxes with 1.2 jars of jam each, she packs 10 * 1.2 = 12 jars of jam. In the 20 boxes with 0.33 jars of jam each, she packs 30 * 0.33 = 9.9 jars of jam. So, in total, she packs 12 + 9.9 = 21.9 jars of jam.

Cassy has 500 jars of jam, so she will have 500 - 21.9 = 478.1 jars of jam left when all the boxes are full. So, the answer is:

Answer: 478.1
