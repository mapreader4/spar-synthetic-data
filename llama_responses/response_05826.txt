Let's break this down step by step.

1. The dog runs through the field.
2. The dog is joined by a group of 4 cats.
So, there are 1 dog + 4 cats = 5 animals.
3. 2 rabbits join each cat. So, each of the 4 cats has 2 rabbits, making a total of 4 * 2 = 8 rabbits.
4. 3 hares join each rabbit. So, each of the 2 rabbits has 3 hares, making a total of 2 * 3 = 6 hares.
5. Now, let's add the number of dogs, cats, rabbits, and hares together. We have 1 + 5 + 4 + 8 + 6 = 19 animals.

Answer: 19
