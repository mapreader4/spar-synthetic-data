Let's break down the time spent on each trip:

* 15 minutes to fill the car with stuff
* 30 minutes to drive from the previous house to the new house

Total time for one trip = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

Since they made 6 trips, the total time spent on trips is:

6 trips * 45 minutes per trip = 6 * 45 = 270 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we can divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

270 minutes รท 60 = 4.5 hours
