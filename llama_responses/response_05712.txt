Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The airline company owns 5 airplanes.
2. Each airplane has 20 rows with 7 seats in each row.
3. The number of seats in each airplane is 7 * 20 = 140.
4. The airline company has 5 airplanes, so the total number of seats is 5 * 140 = 700.
5. Each airplane makes 2 flights a day.
6. So, the total number of passengers each day is 700 * 2 = 1400.

Answer: 1400
