Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of 5 kilograms of apples. One kilogram of apples costs $2, so 5 kilograms of apples will cost 5 * 2 = 10 dollars.

Next, we need to find the cost of 3 packs of sugar. One pack of sugar is $1 cheaper than one kilogram of apples, so one pack of sugar is $1. So, 3 packs of sugar will cost 3 * 1 = 3 dollars.

Finally, we need to find the cost of 500 grams of walnuts. One kilogram of walnuts costs $6, and 1000 grams is equal to 1 kilogram, so 500 grams of walnuts will cost 500 / 1000 * 6 = 3 dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

10 dollars for the apples, 3 dollars for the sugar, and 3 dollars for the walnuts. Adding these together, we get:

10 + 3 + 3 = 16

Answer: 16
