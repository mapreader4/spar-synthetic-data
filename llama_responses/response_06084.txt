Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many books each student got. Since there are 15 girls and 10 boys, we have a total of 15 + 10 = 25 students.

2. Now, we need to find out how many books each student got. Since the 375 books are divided equally among 25 students, we can divide 375 by 25. To do this, we can use the division operation.
