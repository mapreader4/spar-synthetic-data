Let's start by identifying the total number of red and white jelly beans in the bag Jessica bought.

There are 24 red jelly beans and 18 white jelly beans, so the total number of red and white jelly beans in the bag is:

24 (red) + 18 (white) = 42

Since Jessica assumes that each bag of jelly beans has a similar distribution of colors, we can multiply the total number of red and white jelly beans in the bag by 3 to get an estimate of the total number of red and white jelly beans in the fishbowl.

42 (red and white jelly beans in the bag) x 3 = 126

So, Jessica's guess as to how many red and white jelly beans were in the fishbowl is:

Answer: 126
