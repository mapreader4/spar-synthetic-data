Let the purchase price of the first commodity be x. The purchase price of the second commodity is x - 127. The total cost is 2x. We know that the total cost is 827. So, we can set up an equation.

2x = 827

To solve for x, we can subtract 127 from both sides of the equation.

2x - 127 = 827 - 127
2x = 700

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2.

x = 700 / 2
x = 350

So, the purchase price of the first commodity is 350.
