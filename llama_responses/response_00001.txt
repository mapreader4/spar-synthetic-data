Let's break it down step by step:

1. She earns $12 per hour, so we need to find the amount of money she earned in 50 minutes.
2. 50 minutes is half an hour, so we need to multiply 50/2 to get the hourly rate: 12 * 0.5 = 6.
3. She earned 6 dollars in 50 minutes, so she earned a total of 6 dollars.
