Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate how much money Cary has left to save for the shoes. He has already saved $30, and the shoes cost $120, so he still needs to save $120 - $30 = $90.

Cary earns $5 for every lawn he mows. To find out how many lawns he needs to mow to earn the remaining amount, we can divide the amount left to save ($90) by the amount he earns per lawn ($5):

$90 รท $5 = 18

So, Cary needs to mow 18 lawns to earn enough money to buy the shoes.
