Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Toby wants to make sure he has 500 calories for breakfast. He has one piece of bread, which has 100 calories. He wants to know how many servings of peanut butter he should add to make sure he has 500 calories.

Step 2: Let's calculate the total calories from the bread. If he already has 100 calories from the bread, he needs 500 - 100 = 400 more calories from the peanut butter.

Step 3: A serving of peanut butter has 200 calories. To find out how many servings he should add, we divide 400 by 200. 400 รท 200 = 2.
