Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total time spent driving to the beach. Since the drive is 2 hours each way, the total driving time is 2 x 2 = 4 hours.

Then, Jake spends 2.5 hours at the beach. So, to find the total time taken for the trip, we need to add the driving time to the time spent at the beach.

Total time = driving time + time at the beach
Total time = 4 hours + 2.5 hours
Total time = 4 hours + 2.5 hours = 6.5 hours
