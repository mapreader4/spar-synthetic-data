Let's start by identifying the number of instances of bullying Kris has been suspended for.

Kris has been suspended for bullying many times.  For every instance of bullying, she was suspended for 3 days.  So, the number of days Kris has been suspended for is the number of instances of bullying times 3.

A typical person has 10 fingers and 2 toes.  So, the number of days Kris has been suspended for is 10 + 2, which is 12.
