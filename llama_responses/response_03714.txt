Let's break down Jacob's earnings and savings step by step.

Initially, Jacob earns $20 per hour and works 10 hours, so he earns:

$20/hour x 10 hours = $200

He then sells cookies for $4 each and sells 24 pieces, so he earns:

$4/cookie x 24 cookies = $96

In total, Jacob has:

$200 (from job) + $96 (from cookies) = $296

He then buys a lottery ticket for $10 and wins $500, so his total amount is:

$296 + $500 - $10 (for lottery ticket) = $786

Finally, he receives $500 from each of his sisters, so his total amount becomes:

$786 + $500 + $500 = $1786

Now, Jacob needs $5000 to go to Brickville, and he has $1786. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract his current amount from the total amount needed:

$5000 - $1786 = $3214

Answer: 3214
