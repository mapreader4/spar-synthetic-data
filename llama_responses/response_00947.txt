Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Johnny has x amount of practice currently. Since he practices the same amount each day, that means that x is the number of days he has practiced so far.

As of 20 days ago, he had half as much practice as he has currently. So, we can set up an equation:

x - 20 = x/2

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 2:

x - 20 = x/2 * 2
x - 20 = x

Add 20 to both sides:

x = x + 20

So, Johnny had x + 20 practice 20 days ago.

Now, he wants to have 3 times as much practice as he does currently. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 20 + y = 3x

We can subtract x from both sides:

y = 2x

Now, we know that y is the number of days it will take for Johnny to have 3 times as much practice as he does currently. So, the answer is:

Answer: 2x
