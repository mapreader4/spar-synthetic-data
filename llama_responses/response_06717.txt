Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know:

* Peter's age in four years will be twice Harriet's age.
* Peter's current age is half his mother's age, which is 60.

Let's call Peter's current age x. Then, in four years, Peter's age will be 2x.

We know that 2x = 60, so x = 30. So, Peter is currently 30 years old.

Now, we know that Peter's age is half his mother's age, which is 60. So, Peter's mother is 60 - 30 = 30.

Harriet is 60 - 30 = 30 years old.
