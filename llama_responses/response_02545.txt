Let's break it down step by step.

Gus eats 2 eggs for breakfast, so he eats 2 eggs.
He has an egg salad sandwich made with 3 eggs for lunch, so he eats 3 eggs.
He then has an egg drop soup made with 1 egg for dinner, so he eats 1 egg.

To find the total number of eggs Gus ate, we add the number of eggs he ate at each meal together:

2 + 3 + 1 = 6

Answer: 6
