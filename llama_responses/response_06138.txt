Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. Heaven and her brother get $100 in total to spend.
2. Heaven buys 2 sharpeners at $5 each, so she spends 2 x 5 = $10.
3. So, she has $100 - $10 = $90 left.
4. Her brother buys 10 erasers at $4 each, so he spends 10 x 4 = $40.
5. So, he has $90 - $40 = $50 left.
6. Heaven's brother uses the remaining $50 to buy highlighters.

Answer: 50
