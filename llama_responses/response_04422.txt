Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying three iPhones at the original price:
3 x 600 = 1800

Step 2: Calculate the discount for buying two iPhones:
2 x 600 = 1200
Discount = 5% of 1200 = 0.05 x 1200 = 60
Total discount = 60

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying three iPhones with the discount:
1800 - 60 = 1740

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of buying one iPhone each:
3 x 600 = 1800

Step 5: Compare the total cost of buying one iPhone each with the total cost of buying three iPhones with the discount:
1800 > 1740

Answer: 60
