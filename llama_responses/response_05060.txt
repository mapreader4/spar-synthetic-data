Let's break it down step by step.

First, if you buy 2 packs of 500 mL milk, it will cost $2.50. So, the cost of 1 pack of 500 mL milk is $2.50 / 2 = $1.25.

Now, if you buy them individually, they will cost $1.30 each. So, the cost of 10 sets of 2 packs of 500 mL milk will be 2 * 1.30 = $2.60.

To find the total savings, I will subtract the cost of buying them individually from the cost of buying them in bulk: $2.60 - $2.50 = $0.10.

Answer: 10 cents.
