Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the distance she runs in meters. 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, so 3 kilometers is equal to 3000 meters.

Then, we need to find her speed in meters per minute. We know she runs 3000 meters in 120 minutes, which means we can set up a proportion to solve for the speed in meters per minute.

Let's set up the proportion: 3000 meters / 120 minutes = x meters / 1 minute. To solve for x, we can cross multiply both sides of the proportion to get:

x = 3000 / 120 / 1

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 120:

x = 3000 / 1 = 25

So, her speed is 25 meters per minute.
