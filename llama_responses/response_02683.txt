Let's break this down step by step.

Alexandra bought 8 magazines on Friday. Then, she bought 12 more magazines, so she now has 8 + 12 = 20 magazines.

On Sunday, she bought 4 times the number of magazines she bought on Friday, which is 4 x 8 = 32 magazines. She now has 20 + 32 = 52 magazines.

Then, she found that her dog chewed up 4 magazines, so she has 52 - 4 = 48 magazines left.

Answer: 48
