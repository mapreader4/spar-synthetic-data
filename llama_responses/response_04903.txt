To find the difference in the amount they contributed, we need to subtract the amount Margo donated from the amount Julie donated. The difference is:

Margo donated $4300 and Julie donated $4700. 

To find the difference, I will subtract the two amounts: 

$4700 - $4300 = $400

The answer is: Answer: 400
