Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Each horse needs twice as much water as a pig, so a horse needs 3 * 2 = 6 gallons of water.
2. Since there are 10 horses, the total amount of water needed for the horses is 10 * 6 = 60 gallons.
3. The chickens drink from one tank that needs 30 gallons.
4. To find the total amount of water needed, we need to add the amount needed for the horses and the chickens. So, we add 60 + 30 = 90 gallons.

Answer: 90
