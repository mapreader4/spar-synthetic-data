Let's start by letting Diego's amount be x. Then, Celina got 4x. We know that the total amount paid to the two is 50,000. So, we can set up an equation: 50,000 = x + 4x. We can solve this equation to find the value of x.

50,000 = x + 4x
50,000 = 5x

We can subtract 4x from both sides of the equation to get:

46,000 = x

Then, we can divide both sides by 4 to find the value of x:

46,000 / 4 = 11,500

So, Diego got 11,500.
