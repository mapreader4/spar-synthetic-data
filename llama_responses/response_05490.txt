Let's break this problem down step by step:

On Monday, Junior bought 6 toys for his rabbits.

On Wednesday, he bought twice as many toys as he did on Monday, which is 6 x 2 = 12 toys.

On Friday, he bought four times as many toys as he did on Monday, which is 6 x 4 = 24 toys.

On the next day, he bought half as many toys as he did on Wednesday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

So, in total, Junior bought 6 + 12 + 24 + 6 = 48 toys.

Since he has 16 rabbits, and he splits the toys evenly between them, we can divide the total number of toys by the number of rabbits:

48 รท 16 = 3
