Let's break down the sentence lengths:

* Arson (2 counts) = 2 x 6 years = 12 years
* Explosives sentence = 12 years (since it is twice the length of the arson sentence)
* Domestic terrorism sentence = 20 years

To find the total sentence length, we add up the lengths of each sentence:

12 years (arson) + 12 years (explosives) + 20 years (domestic terrorism) = 44 years

So, James might spend 44 years in jail.
