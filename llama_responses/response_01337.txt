Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Let's start by identifying the number of shoes that Bonny has: 13.
2. We know that Becky has 2 times as many pairs of shoes as Bonny has, so Becky has 2 x 13 = 26 pairs of shoes.
3. Bobby has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Becky has, so Bobby has 3 x 26 = 78 pairs of shoes.

Answer: 78
