Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the dinner party without the discount. Monica charges $25.00 per person, and Phoebe is having a dinner party for 20 guests. So, the total cost of the dinner party without the discount is:

$25.00 per person * 20 guests = $500.00

Now, Monica offers a 10% discount for repeat customers. To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost:

$500.00 * 0.10 = $50.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$500.00 - $50.00 = $450.00

So, Monica will make $450.00 from the party.

Answer: 450
