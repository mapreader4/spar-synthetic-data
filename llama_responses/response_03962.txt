Let's think step by step.

Lucas has $20 and he needs to buy 3 avocados that cost $2 each. To find the total cost of the avocados, we multiply the cost of each avocado by the number of avocados:

3 x 2 = 6

So, the total cost of the avocados is $6.

Lucas has $20, and he needs to pay for the avocados. To find the change, we subtract the cost of the avocados from the $20:

$20 - 6 = $14

So, Lucas brings home $14.
