Let's break this down step by step!

Let's start by identifying the total number of friends Katrina referred: 5 friends on the same day + 7 friends by the end of the week = 5 + 7 = 12 friends

For each of her 12 friends, Katrina earned $5.00, so she earned 12 x $5.00 = $60.00

Additionally, Katrina also earned $5.00 for each of her 12 friends, so she earned another 12 x $5.00 = $60.00

In total, Katrina earned $60.00 (from her friends) + $60.00 (from herself) = $120.00

So, Katrina and her friends made a total of $120.00.

Answer: 120
