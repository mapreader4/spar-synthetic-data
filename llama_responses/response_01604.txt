Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Mary paints a dragon using 3 square feet of paint. This means that 3 square feet of paint is used up.
2. Mike paints a castle using 2 square feet more paint than Mary used on her dragon. Since Mary used 3 square feet, Mike used 3 + 2 = 5 square feet of paint.
3. The total amount of paint used by Mary and Mike is 3 + 5 = 8 square feet.
4. There is enough paint left in the jar to cover 13 square feet.
5. Since 13 - 8 = 5 square feet of paint is left, this is the amount of paint left to paint the sun.
