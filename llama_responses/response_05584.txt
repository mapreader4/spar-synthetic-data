Let’s break this problem down step by step.

Let’s start by identifying the number of people who are voting for Marty. We know that 45% of the people polled said they are voting for Biff, and 8% are undecided. We are looking for the number of people who are voting for Marty, which is 100% - 45% - 8%.

Let’s calculate the number of people voting for Marty:

100% - 45% = 45

Subtract 8% from this number to get the number of people voting for Marty:

45 - 8 = 37

So, 37 people are voting for Marty.

Answer: 37
