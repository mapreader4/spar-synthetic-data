Let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume that each person takes the same amount of time to figure out the solution to the math problem, and we can model it as a linear combination of their individual times.

Let's call the time it takes the first person to solve the problem "x" hours. Then, if we add the second person to the equation, the total time would be 2x hours.

So, if it takes 1 person 10 hours to solve the problem, we can set up the equation as:

10 = x

Now, if we add the second person, we can multiply both sides by 2:

2x = 2 * x

We know that 2 * 10 = 20, so we can solve for x:

x = 10

So, the equation is x = 10, which means that the two people would take 10 hours to solve the problem together.

Answer: 10
