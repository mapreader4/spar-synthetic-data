Let's break down the items and their prices.

Leonard bought a wallet for $50.
Leonard bought two pairs of sneakers for $100 each pair, so that's $200.
Michael bought a backpack for $100.
Michael bought two pairs of jeans for $50 each pair, so that's $100.

To find the total cost, we add up all the prices:
$50 + $200 + $100 + $100 = $350

So, the answer is:

Answer: 350
