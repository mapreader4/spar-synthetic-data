To solve this problem, we need to determine how old Mel will be in years when Katherine is 2 dozen years old.

Since Katherine is 2 dozen years old, we can subtract 2 dozen from her current age to get Mel's age. 

2 dozen is equal to 24, so we subtract 24 from Katherine's age.

Katherine is 3 years older than Mel. So, 24 - 3 = 21.
