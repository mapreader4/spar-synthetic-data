Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the time it took Leo to finish the first part of the assignment is 25 minutes. If it took him twice as long to finish the second part, then the time it took to finish the second part is 25 * 2 = 50 minutes.

Since the total time it took Leo to finish his assignment is 2 hours, and the time it took to finish the first part was 25 minutes, the time it took to finish the third part is 2 hours - 25 minutes = 75 minutes.

Answer: 75
