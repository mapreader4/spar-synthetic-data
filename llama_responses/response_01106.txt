Let's start by letting the age of the younger friend be x. Then, the age of the older friend will be x + 2.

We know that the sum of their ages is 74, so we can write an equation to solve for x:

x + (x + 2) = 74

We can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 72

So, the age of the older friend is 72 years old.
