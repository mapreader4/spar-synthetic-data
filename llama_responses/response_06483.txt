Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information: Carrie has 20 cups of potatoes, and she mixed 2 cups of turnips with 5 cups of potatoes. We know that 2 cups is equal to 0.5 cups, so the total amount of potatoes and turnips is 5 + 0.5 = 5.5 cups.

Since Carrie wants to add more turnips to the mixture, we need to find out how many cups of turnips she needs to add to get to a total of 20 cups. Let's subtract the 5.5 cups that are already there from the total amount of cups she has, which is 20.

20 - 5.5 = 14.5

So, Carrie needs to add 14.5 cups of turnips to the mixture.
