Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Anna wants to have at least 12 large salads. Since half of the lettuce will be lost, she wants to grow at least 24 large salads in total. Since each lettuce plant provides 3 large salads, she needs to grow:

24 (at least) รท 3 = 8

Anna needs to grow at least 8 lettuce plants to ensure she has enough lettuce for 12 large salads, considering half of the lettuce will be lost.
