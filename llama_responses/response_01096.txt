Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of jellybeans that Rory has. Rory has 30 more jellybeans than Gigi, so Rory has 30 - 15 = 15 jellybeans.

Now, Lorelai has eaten three times the number of jellybeans that both girls have. So, the number of jellybeans that both girls have is 15. To find out how many jellybeans Lorelai has eaten, we need to multiply 15 by 3.

15 * 3 = 45.

So, Lorelai has eaten 45 jellybeans.
