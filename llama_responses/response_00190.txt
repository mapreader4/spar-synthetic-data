Let's start by using the information given to set up an equation.

Let's say Darcy's age is x.

Since Darcy is twice as old as Dexter, who is 8, we can write an equation to represent this:

x = 2 * 8

This means that Darcy is 16 years old.

Now, we know that Dallas is 3 times the age of Darcy. So, we can write another equation to represent this:

Dallas = 3 * x

We can substitute the value of x, which is 16, into this equation to get:

Dallas = 3 * 16

Dallas is 48 years old.
