Let's first calculate the total number of books that can be sold for $2.50 each. Two-fifths of the books can be sold for $2.50 each, so that would be 2/5 * 2.5 = 10 books. The rest of the books can be sold for $2 each. That would be 8 books. So the total number of books sold for $2.50 each would be 10 + 8 = 18. The total amount earned would be 18 * 2.5 = 45. The total amount earned is 45 dollars.
