Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding Jake's weight. Since Jake weighs 8kg more than Tracy, and Tracy weighs 52kg, we can set up the equation as follows:

Jake's weight = Tracy's weight + 8

Jake's weight = 52 + 8
Jake's weight = 60

Now that we know Jake's weight, we can find the range of their weights. The range of their weights is from the minimum weight of Tracy (52kg) to the maximum weight of Jake (60kg). We can represent this range as:

Answer: 52-60
