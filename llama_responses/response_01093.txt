Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Lorenzo had 3 full cans of thumbtacks, and he used 1 tack from each can for every board he tested. We also know that he tested 120 boards.

Let's start by finding the total number of tacks used. Since he used 1 tack for each of the 120 boards, the total number of tacks used is 120.

We also know that at the end of the day, he had 30 tacks remaining in each of the 3 cans. To find the total number of tacks in the 3 cans, we can multiply the number of tacks remaining in each can by the number of cans:

30 tacks/can x 3 cans = 90 tacks

So, the total number of tacks in the 3 cans is 90.

To find the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans, we need to add the number of tacks used (120) to the number of tacks remaining (90):

120 (tacks used) + 90 (tacks remaining) = 210

Answer: 210
