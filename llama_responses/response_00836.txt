Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's let the number of heads be h. Let's let the number of tails be t.

We know that the total number of flips is 211. We know that the number of heads is 65.

So, we can set up the equation as follows:

h + t = 211

We want to know the value of t, which is the number of tails. So, we need to solve for t.

t = 211 - h

We can subtract 65 from both sides of the equation:

t = 211 - 65

t = 146

So, the number of tails is 146.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 146
