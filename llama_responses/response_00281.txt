Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that Betty's account has a balance of $3,456. Since Gina has two accounts, each account has a quarter of Betty's balance, we can say that each account has a balance of $3,456 / 4 = $864.

To find the combined balance of both accounts, we need to add the balances of both accounts together. So, we have 2 x $864 = $1,728.

Answer: 1728
