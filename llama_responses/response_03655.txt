Let's start by calculating the total weight of the ingredients.

Martha needs 1.5 kg of cheese, which is equal to 1500 grams (1.5 x 1000). She also needs 500 grams of meat.

The total weight of the ingredients is 1500 + 500 = 2000 grams.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cheese and meat.

The cheese costs $6 per kilogram, so the cheese will cost 6 x 1.5 = $9. The meat costs $8 per kilogram, so the meat will cost 8 x 0.5 = $4.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cheese and the cost of the meat. So, the total cost is 9 + 4 = 13.
