Let's start by letting x be the number of male members in the club. Since there are 18 members in the club and there are two times as many female members, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 18

To solve for x, we can subtract 2x from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

x = 18 / 3

x = 6

So, the number of male members in the club is 6.

Answer: 6
