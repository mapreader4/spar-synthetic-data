To find the speed of the car, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken. 

First, we convert the time from hours to hours. 4 hours and 30 minutes is equal to 4.5 hours. 

So, the total time taken is 4.5 hours. 

Now, we divide the distance by the time: 

Distance = 360 miles
Time = 4.5 hours

Distance / Time = Distance / 4.5

Distance / 4.5 = 80

Answer: 80
