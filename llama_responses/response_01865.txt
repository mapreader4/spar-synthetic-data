Let's break it down step by step.

Linda has 2 dimes, 6 quarters, and 5 nickels initially.

Her mother gives her 2 more dimes. So, Linda now has 2 + 2 = 4 dimes.

Her mother gives her 10 quarters. So, Linda now has 6 + 10 = 16 quarters.

Her mother gives her twice as many nickels as she has. Linda has 5 nickels, so she gives her 2 * 5 = 10 nickels.

So, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of dimes, quarters, and nickels together:

4 dimes + 16 quarters + 10 nickels = 4 + 16 + 10 = 30

Answer: 30
