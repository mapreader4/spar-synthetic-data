Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the information that Tim has 1 hundred photos less than the total amount of photos, which is 152. So, Tim has 152 - 100 = 52 photos.

We know that Paul has 10 more photos than Tim. So, Paul has 52 + 52 = 104 photos.

We are asked how many photos Tom has. We know that Paul has 104 photos, and Tom has less photos than Paul. So, Tom has 104 - 10 = 94 photos.

Answer: 94
