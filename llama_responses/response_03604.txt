Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first week, 40 pounds of food were donated to the food bank.

In the second week, donations were twice as high as the first week, so the amount of food donated in the second week is:

40 pounds (first week) x 2 = 80 pounds

So, the total amount of food donated in the first two weeks is:

40 pounds (first week) + 80 pounds (second week) = 120 pounds

In the third week, Lyanna gave out 70% of the donated food to the homeless. To find the amount of food given out, we need to calculate 70% of 120 pounds:

120 pounds x 0.7 = 84 pounds

So, Lyanna gave out 84 pounds of food to the homeless.

To find the amount of food remaining in the food bank, we subtract the amount given out from the total amount donated:

120 pounds (total donated) - 84 pounds (given out) = 36 pounds

Answer: 36
