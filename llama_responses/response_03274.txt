Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, the aquarium has 60 fish.

After two weeks, the Bobbit worm eats 2 fish every day, so it eats 14 fish in total. 60 - 14 = 46 fish.

Then, James adds 8 more fish to the aquarium, so now there are 46 + 8 = 54 fish.

A week later, James discovers the Bobbit worm.
