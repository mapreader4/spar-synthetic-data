Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Robbie weighs 100 pounds. We are also given that Patty was 4.5 times as heavy as Robbie, so we can set up an equation to represent Patty's initial weight: Patty's initial weight = 4.5 x 100 = 450 pounds. Since Patty has lost 235 pounds, we can subtract that from her initial weight to find her current weight: Patty's current weight = 450 - 235 = 215 pounds. We are asked to find how much more Patty weighs than Robbie now, so we can subtract Robbie's weight from Patty's weight: Patty's weight - Robbie's weight = 215 - 100 = 115 pounds. 

Answer: 115
