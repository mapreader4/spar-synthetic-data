Let's break this problem down step by step.

Marcy has 6 tubs of lip gloss, and each tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss. So, the total number of tubes of lip gloss she has is:

6 tubs x 2 tubes/tub = 12 tubes

Each tube of lip gloss holds enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. So, the total number of people Marcy can do makeup for is:

12 tubes x 3 people/tube = 36 people

Answer: 36
