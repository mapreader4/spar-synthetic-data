Let's think step by step.

Let's say the number of marshmallows Jacob has is x.

We know that Jacob has 6 marshmallows initially. We are asked how many more marshmallows he needs to buy.

The number of marshmallows Jacob has is 6. He wants to make s'mores. Each s'more takes one marshmallow. So, to make 48 s'mores, Jacob will need 48 / 1 = 48 marshmallows.

But Jacob has 6 marshmallows. So, he needs 48 - 6 = 42 more marshmallows.

Answer: 42
