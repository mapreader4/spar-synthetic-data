Let's break it down step by step.

Gondor repairs phones, and he earns $10 for each phone. He repaired 3 phones last Monday, so he earns 3 x $10 = $30.

Gondor repairs phones again on Tuesday, and he repairs 5 phones. He earns 5 x $10 = $50.

Gondor repairs laptops on Wednesday, and he repairs 2 laptops. He earns 2 x $20 = $40.

Gondor repairs laptops on Thursday, and he repairs 4 laptops. He earns 4 x $20 = $80.

To find the total amount Gondor earns, we add up the money he earns each day:

$30 + $50 + $40 + $80 = $160

Answer: 160
