Let's break down the order step by step.

1. 2 drip coffees that are $2.25 each:
2 x 2.25 = 4.50

2. One double shot espresso that's $3.50:
3.50

3. 2 lattes that are $4.00 each:
2 x 4.00 = 8.00
One of those lattes needs vanilla syrup for an additional $0.50:
8.00 + 0.50 = 8.50

4. 2 cold brew coffees that are $2.50 each:
2 x 2.50 = 5.00

5. 1 cappuccino that's $3.50:
3.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of the order:
4.50 + 3.50 + 8.50 + 5.00 + 3.50 = 25.00
