Let's break this down step by step.

Harry ran 10 meters per hour on Monday. On Tuesday, he ran 50% faster than on Monday, so he ran 15 meters per hour (10 * 1.5 = 15). On Friday, he ran 60% faster than he ran on Thursday. Since he ran 15 meters per hour on Thursday, that means he ran 18 meters per hour (15 * 1.6 = 24). 

So, on Friday, Harry ran 24 meters per hour.
