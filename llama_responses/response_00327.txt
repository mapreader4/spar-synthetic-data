Let's break it down step by step:

1. The problem states that it takes 15 mink skins to make a coat. So, if we know how many minks are needed, we can find the number of coats Andy can make.

2. The problem also states that Andy buys 30 minks. Since each mink has 6 babies, and half of the total minks are set free by activists, we can find the number of minks that are not set free.

3. To find the number of minks that are not set free, we can subtract the number of minks set free from the total number of minks. 30 - (30/2) = 15 minks are not set free.

4. Now, we can use the fact that it takes 15 mink skins to make a coat to find the number of coats Andy can make. Since 15 mink skins are needed to make a coat, and 15 minks are not set free, we can find the number of coats Andy can make.
