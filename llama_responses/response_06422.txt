Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Eric runs for 20 minutes to reach the park. So, it takes him 20 minutes to get to the park.
2. Then, he jogs for 10 minutes to reach the park. So, it takes him an additional 10 minutes.
3. When he returns, he takes a different route home and this takes him 3 times as long as his trip there. So, the time it takes him to get there is 3 times the time it took to get to the park.
4. So, the total time it takes Eric to return home is the time it took to get to the park plus the time it took to get back home, which is 3 times as long as the time it took to get to the park.

Let's calculate the total time it took to get to the park. 20 minutes + 10 minutes = 30 minutes. Now, we multiply this by 3, because it takes him 3 times as long as his trip there. 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.

Answer: 90
