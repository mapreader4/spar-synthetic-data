Let's break this down step by step.

Josh had 100 gummy bear candies initially. He gave his 3 siblings 10 candies each, so he gave away 30 candies.

Then, he gave half of the remaining candies to his best friend. Since there are 100 - 30 = 70 candies left, half of that is 35 candies. So, he gave away 35 candies to his best friend.

Now, he wants to eat 16 gummy bear candies. He has 35 - 16 = 19 candies left.

Answer: 19
