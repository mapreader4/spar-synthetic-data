Let's break down the time spent by considering each shoe individually. For one shoe, it takes 5 minutes to replace the buckle and 10 minutes to even out the heel, so for each shoe, the total time spent is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes. Since Melissa has 2 shoes to repair, the total time spent is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.
