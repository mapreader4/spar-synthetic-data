Let's start by calculating the total value of the cards Arthur can sell: 2,000 cards x 5 cents = 10,000 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the total value from cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 10,000 cents รท 100 = 100 dollars.

Now, let's calculate how many comic books Arthur can buy with the money he has after selling his cards: 100 dollars รท 6 = 16.67. Since he buys comic books, he will have some money left over. So, the money left over is 100 - 16.67 = 83.33. Answer: 83.33.
