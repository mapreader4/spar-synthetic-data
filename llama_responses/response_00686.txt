Let's break it down step by step.

1. The cost of the cottage is $5 per hour.
2. They rented it for 8 hours.
3. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per hour by the number of hours: 5 * 8 = 40.
4. To find the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the number of people: 40 / 2 = 20.

Answer: 20
