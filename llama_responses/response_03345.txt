Let's start by using the given information to write an equation.

Rica's group won 3/8 of the prize money.

So, let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let P be the total prize money.

Rica's group won 3/8 of the prize money, which means Rica's group got 3/8 x P.

Rica spent 1/5 of her prize money. So, she spent 1/5 of P.

Now, we know Rica's group got 3/8 of P, and she spent 1/5 of P. So, Rica's group is left with P - 1/5P.

We are given that Rica's group is left with $300. So, we can write:

P - 1/5P = 300.

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

P - 1/5P = 300
5( P) = 300

P = 300 / (1/5)

P = 600

So, the prize money Rica's group won was $600.
