Let's break it down step by step:

1. Morgan pays $20 for his lunch.
2. He gets a hamburger for $4, so he spends $4.
3. He gets onion rings for $2, so he spends $2.
4. He gets a smoothie for $3, so he spends $3.
5. He has spent a total of $4 + $2 + $3 = $9.
6. So, Morgan has $20 - $9 = $11 left over.

Answer: 11
