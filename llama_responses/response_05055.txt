Let's start by using the information given to find the number of cups of sugar needed for the second layer. The first layer requires 2 cups of sugar, and the second layer is twice as big as the first layer, so it requires 2 * 2 = 4 cups of sugar. The third layer is three times as big as the second layer, so it requires 3 * 4 = 12 cups of sugar.

The total number of cups of sugar needed is the sum of the sugar required for the first, second, and third layers: 2 + 4 + 12 = 16 cups of sugar. Answer: 16.
