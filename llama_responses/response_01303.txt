Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how much Terry spent on Monday. He spent 6 dollars on Monday.

Next, he spent twice as much on Tuesday. Twice of 6 is 2 x 6, which is 12.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on Wednesday. On Wednesday, he spent double the amount he spent the previous two days combined. The previous two days combined is 6 + 12, which is 18. Double of that is 2 x 18, which is 36.

To find the total amount Terry spent, we add up the amounts: 6 + 12 + 36 = 54.

Answer: 54
