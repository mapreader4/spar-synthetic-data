Let's break down the problem step by step.

The house help's medical bill is $128. The couple agreed to pay half of it, so the amount they will pay is $64.

The husband paid for the entire half, so he paid $64.

The house help's total salary is $160. The husband paid $64, so the amount remaining is $160 - $64 = $96.

The couple agreed to split the expenses equally, so they will split the remaining amount of $96. To split it equally, they will each pay half, which is $96 / 2 = $48.

So, the husband still needs to pay $48 to split the expenses equally.

Answer: 48
