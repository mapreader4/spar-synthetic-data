Let's break it down step by step.

Winwin won $50. She paid 20% for the tax, so the tax is $50 * 0.2 = $10. Then she paid $5 for the processing fee. So the total amount she paid is $10 + $5 = $15. To find out how much she was able to take home, we subtract the total amount she paid from the original $50:

$50 - $15 = $35

Answer: 35
