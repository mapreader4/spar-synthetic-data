Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Billy picks 36 dandelions.
2. George picks 1/3 of the remaining dandelions that Billy picked, so George picks 12 dandelions.
3. They both pick 10 more dandelions each, so Billy picks 10 more of the remaining dandelions, and George picks 10 more of the remaining dandelions.
4. Billy and George have picked a total of 36 + 12 + 10 + 10 = 68 dandelions.

To find the average number of dandelions they have picked on average, we can add the total number of dandelions picked by both Billy and George and divide by 2.

Answer: 68 รท 2 = 34.
