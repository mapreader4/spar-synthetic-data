Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of pizzas each person will eat. TreShawn eats 1/2 a pizza, Michael eats 1/3 of a pizza, and LaMar eats 1/6 of a pizza. To find the total number of pizzas they will eat, we can add up these fractions.

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 3/6

So, the total number of pizzas they will eat is 3/6 or 1/2 of a pizza.

To find the number of pizzas TreShawn's mom needs to order, we need to divide 1/2 by the number of people eating: 1/2 รท 3 = 1/6.
