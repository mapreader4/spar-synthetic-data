Let's break this down step by step.

Elise had some amount of dog food initially. Let's call this amount x.

Elise bought a 15kg bag of dog food. This means she now has x + 15kg of dog food.

Then, she bought another 10kg bag of dog food. This means she now has x + 15kg + 10kg = x + 25kg of dog food.

So, Elise now has 25kg of dog food.
