Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's start by identifying the number of each type of hanger.

* Pink hangers: 7
* Green hangers: 4
* Blue hangers: 4 - 1 = 3 (because it says "one less than there are green hangers")
* Yellow hangers: 3 - 1 = 2 (because it says "one less than there are blue hangers")

Now, let's add up the number of each type of hanger:

7 (pink) + 4 (green) + 3 (blue) + 2 (yellow) = 16

So, the total number of colored hangers in Fifi's closet is 16.

Answer: 16
