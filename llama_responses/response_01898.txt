Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Walter is cooking 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes. This means that he can cook 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes, so to find the time it will take to cook all the hushpuppies, we need to find the total number of hushpuppies he needs to cook.

The problem states that each guest will eat 5 hushpuppies. There are 20 guests, so the total number of hushpuppies needed is 20 * 5 = 100. 100 hushpuppies need to be cooked in total.

Now, let's find the time it will take to cook all the hushpuppies. If Walter can cook 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes, then the time it will take to cook 1 hushpuppy is 8 minutes. To find the time it will take to cook 100 hushpuppies, we need to multiply the time it takes to cook 1 hushpuppy by 100.

100 * 8 = 800.

Answer: 800
