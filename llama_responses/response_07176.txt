Let's break this down step by step:

1. Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal. This means that he takes x years to finish high school. Let's call this x.

2. It takes him 3 times that long to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. This means that it takes him 3x years to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.

3. The time it takes to finish high school plus the time it takes to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. is equal to the total time Tate spent in high school and college.

4. Since Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal, we can set up an equation: x + 3x = 1. We can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to get x = -2.

5. Now we know that Tate spent 2 years in high school and college.
