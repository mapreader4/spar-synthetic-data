Let's start by identifying the weights of the dogs:

* The brown dog weighs 4 pounds.
* The black dog weighs 4 + 1 = 5 pounds.
* The white dog weighs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
* The grey dog weighs 5 - 2 = 3 pounds.

To find the average weight of all the dogs, we need to add the weights of all the dogs and divide by 4:

4 + 5 + 8 + 3 = 17

So, the average weight of all the dogs is:

Answer: 17
