Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Nancy has 40 metal beads and 20 pearl beads.
* Rose has 20 crystal beads and 40 stone beads. Since Rose has twice as many stone beads as crystal beads, we know that Rose has 80 stone beads.
* There are 8 beads in each bracelet.

We want to find the number of bracelets that Nancy and Rose can make.

Let's start by adding the number of beads Nancy has. Nancy has 40 metal beads + 20 pearl beads = 60 beads. Rose has 20 crystal beads + 80 stone beads = 100 beads. 60 + 100 = 160 beads. Since there are 8 beads in each bracelet, we can divide the total number of beads by 8 to find the number of bracelets. 160 beads / 8 = 20 bracelets.

Answer: 20
