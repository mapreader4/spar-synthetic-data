Let's break it down step by step.

Benny started with an unknown amount in his piggy bank. Let's call that x.

In January, he adds 19 dollars to the piggy bank, so now he has x + 19 dollars.

In February, he adds the same amount again, so he now has x + 19 + 19 = x + 38 dollars.

By the end of March, he has 46 dollars, so we know that x + 38 + some amount = 46.

To find the amount he added in March, we need to subtract 38 from 46 to get the unknown amount:

46 - 38 = 8

So, Benny added 8 dollars to his piggy bank in March.

Answer: 8
