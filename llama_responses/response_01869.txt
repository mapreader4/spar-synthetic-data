Let's break down the problem step by step.

Francie receives an allowance of $5 a week for 8 weeks, so she gets 5 x 8 = $40 in total.

Then, her dad raises her allowance, and she receives $6 a week for 6 weeks. This is 6 x 6 = $36. So, Francie now has a total of 40 + 36 = $76.

Francie uses half of the money to buy new clothes, which is 76 / 2 = $38. So, she spends $38.

Francie is left with the remaining money, which is 76 - 38 = $38. Then, she buys a video game that costs $35. So, she has 38 - 35 = $3 remaining.
