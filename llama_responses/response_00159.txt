Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: 
- The haircuts are 50% more expensive during the weekends.
- Mario paid $18 for his last haircut on Monday.

Let's say the price for a haircut on a weekday is x.

Since the haircuts are 50% more expensive during the weekends, the price for a haircut on a weekend will be 150% of the weekday price, or 1.5x. 

So, the price for a haircut on the day before (Sunday) will be 1.5x.

Since Mario paid $18 for his haircut on Monday, the price for a haircut on the day before (Sunday) is 1.5x = 18/0.5x. 

To find the value of x, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 0.5:

0.5x = 18/1.5

x = 0.5 * 18 / 1.5

x = 0.5 * 12

x = 6

So, Mario would have paid 6 for his haircut the day before. 

Answer: 6
