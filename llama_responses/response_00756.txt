Let's solve this problem step by step.

Anna had 37 stamps initially. Alison gave Anna half of her 28 stamps, which is 14 stamps. So, Anna now has 37 + 14 = 51 stamps.

Anna traded 2 bluebird stamps for 1 mountain stamp with Jeff, so she got 1 stamp and lost 2 stamps. So, Anna now has 51 - 2 = 49 stamps.

Anna has 49 stamps in the end.
