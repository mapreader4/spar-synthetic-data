Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of members in each group:

* Flute players: 5
* Trumpet players: 3 * 3 = 9
* Trombone players: 9 - 8 = 1
* Drummers: 1 + 9 = 10
* Clarinet players: 5 * 2 = 10
* French horn players: 3 + 9 = 12

To find the total number of members, we add up the numbers: 5 + 9 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 12 = 36

Since there are 36 members in total, the number of seats needed on the bus is:

Answer: 36
