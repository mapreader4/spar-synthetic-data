Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's first find the total number of cars served during the peak hours.
During the peak hours, they serve 12 cars every 15 minutes. So, in one hour, they serve 12 / 15 = 0.8 cars. Since there are 2 hours of peak hours, they serve 2 * 0.8 = 1.6 cars per hour. 

2. Now, let's find the total number of cars served during the off-peak times.
During off-peak times, they serve 8 cars every 15 minutes. So, in one hour, they serve 8 / 15 = 0.53 cars. Since there is one hour of off-peak time, they serve 0.53 * 1 = 0.53 cars.

3. To find the total number of cars served during the given time frame, we need to add the number of cars served during peak hours and off-peak hours.
The total number of cars served during the given time frame is 1.6 + 0.53 = 2.13.

Answer: 2.13
