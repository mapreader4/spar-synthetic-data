Let's break down the problem step by step.

Harry and Kevin start with $200. They spend $42 on the sheet, $18 on the rope, and $14 on the propane tank and burner. This leaves them with:

$200 - $42 = $158
$158 - $18 = $140
$140 - $14 = $126

They have $126 left to spend on helium. The helium costs $1.50 per ounce, so:

$126 / $1.50 = 84 ounces

The balloon can fly 113 feet higher for every ounce of helium they buy. So, the total height they can fly is:

84 ounces * 113 feet/ounce = 9,492 feet

Answer: 9492
