Let's break this problem down step by step.

Marge started with 23 seeds.

5 seeds never grew into plants, so we subtract 5 from 23, leaving 23 - 5 = 18 seeds.

A third of the remaining seeds grew, but were eaten by squirrels and rabbits. To find a third of 18, we divide 18 by 3, which is 6. So 6 seeds grew, but were eaten by squirrels and rabbits. 18 - 6 = 12 seeds remain.

A third of the number of uneaten plants were strangled by weeds. A third of 12 is 4. So 4 plants were strangled by weeds. 12 - 4 = 8 plants remain.

Marge pulled 1 weed, but liked the flowers on one weed and let the plant grow. So, she has 1 additional plant. 8 + 1 = 9 plants.

Answer: 9
