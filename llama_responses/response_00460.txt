Let's break it down step by step.

Last year, John made $100,000. He got a $10,000 bonus, which is 10% of his total pay. This means the percentage of his total pay that he got as a bonus is 10%.

This year, John makes $200,000. To find his bonus, we need to find the 10% of his total pay. To do this, we can multiply his total pay by 0.10, which is the decimal form of 10%.

$200,000 x 0.10 = $20,000

John's bonus is $20,000. To find his total pay and bonus, we add the two amounts together.

$100,000 + $20,000 = $120,000

Answer: 120,000
