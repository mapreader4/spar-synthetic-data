Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of friends planting flowers. There are 5 people planting flowers in total: James and 4 of his friends. 

Let's identify the total number of flowers planted. The total number of flowers planted is 200.

Now, we need to find the number of flowers planted by James. Since there are 5 people planting flowers, we can divide the total number of flowers by the number of people. 

Let's do the division: 200 flowers รท 5 people = 40 flowers per person.

So, James planted 40 flowers in a day.
