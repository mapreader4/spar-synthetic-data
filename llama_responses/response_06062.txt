To find the total number of bowling balls, we need to add the number of red bowling balls to the number of green bowling balls.

The problem states that there are 30 red bowling balls, but it also states that there are 6 more green bowling balls than red. To find the number of green bowling balls, we need to add 6 to the number of red bowling balls. So, the number of green bowling balls is 6.

So, the total number of bowling balls is the sum of the number of red bowling balls and the number of green bowling balls:

30 (red bowling balls) + 6 (green bowling balls) = 36

Answer: 36
