Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Jemma sells x frames. Since Jemma sells twice as many frames as Dorothy, Dorothy must sell x/2 frames. We know that Jemma sold 400 frames, so we can set up an equation.

x/2 = 400

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 2, to get:

x = 200

Now we know that Jemma sold 200 frames. We also know that Jemma sells each frame for 5 dollars, so we can multiply 200 by 5 to get the total amount of money Jemma made.

200 * 5 = 1000

Jemma made a total of 1000 dollars from the sale of the glass frames.
