To find the distance the fox would travel in 120 minutes, we can multiply the speed of the fox by the time. The speed of the fox is 50 kilometers per hour, and the time is 120 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing 120 by 60, which is 2 hours. So, the time is 2 hours. 

Speed * time = distance. Speed * 2 hours = 50 * 2 = 100. 

Answer: 100.
