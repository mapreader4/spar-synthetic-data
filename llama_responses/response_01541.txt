Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of flowers. If she has 8 bunches of flowers with 9 flowers in each bunch, she has a total of 8 x 9 = 72 flowers.

If she puts 12 flowers in each bunch instead, she will have a total of 8 x 12 = 96 flowers.

So, the difference between the two is 96 - 72 = 24.

So, the number of bunches needed to get 96 flowers is 24 / 12 = 2.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 2
