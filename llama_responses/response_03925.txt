Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Let's identify the total hours Jenny has to work on the project. She has 20 hours total.

Step 2: Let's identify the hours she has already worked. She has worked 12 hours so far, which is 10 hours for research and 2 hours for the proposal.

Step 3: To find the hours left, we subtract the hours worked from the total hours. 20 - 12 = 8.
