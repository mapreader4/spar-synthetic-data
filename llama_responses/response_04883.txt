Let's break this down step by step:

1. The total cost of the MRI is $1200.
2. The doctor charges $300 for 30 minutes, so the total time charge is $300.
3. There is a $150 fee just for being seen.
4. The total cost is the sum of the MRI cost and the time charge and the fee.

The total cost is $1200 + $300 + $150 = $1650.

The insurance covers 80% of the cost. So, 80% of $1650 is:

$1650 * 0.8 = $1320

So, the amount Tim paid is $1320.
