Let's break it down step by step.

Josie receives $50 as a gift. She wants to buy two cassette tapes that cost $9 each, so the total cost of the tapes will be 2 x $9 = $18. Then she wants to buy a headphone set that costs $25. The total cost of the headphone set is $25. To find out how much money Josie will have left, we need to subtract the total cost of the tapes and the headphone set from the $50 she received.

$50 - $18 - $25 = $7.
