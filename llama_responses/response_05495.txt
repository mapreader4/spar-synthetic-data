Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that DeShawn made 12 free-throws, and Kayla made 50% more than DeShawn. We can represent this as an equation:

DeShawn + 50% = Kayla

We also know that Annieka made 4 fewer than Kayla. We can represent this as an equation:

Kayla - 4 = Annieka

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for Annieka by subtracting 50% from both sides of the first equation to get:

DeShawn + 50% - 50% = Kayla - 4

This simplifies to:

DeShawn = Kayla - 4

We know that DeShawn made 12 free-throws, so we can substitute that in for DeShawn:

12 = Kayla - 4

Subtract 4 from both sides to get:

12 - 4 = Kayla

This simplifies to:

8 = Kayla

Now we can solve for Kayla by adding 4 to both sides:

Kayla = 12

Finally, we can solve for Annieka by subtracting 4 from Kayla:

Kayla - 4 = Annieka

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:

8 - 4 = Annieka

This simplifies to:

4 = Annieka

Answer: 4
