Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Tim hires 2 bodyguards.
* Each bodyguard charges $20 per hour.
* Each bodyguard works for 8 hours a day.
* He hires them for 7 days a week.

We need to calculate the total amount Tim pays each bodyguard in a week.

To do this, we can multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked:

$20 per hour * 8 hours = $160 per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the daily pay by 7:

$160 per day * 7 = $1120

So, the total amount Tim pays each bodyguard in a week is $1120.
