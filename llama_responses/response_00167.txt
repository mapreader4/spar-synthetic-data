Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the length of Janet's previous movie was 2 hours, or 120 minutes. 60% more than that would be 1.2 * 60 = 120 minutes. The total length of the new movie is 2.2 hours, or 132 minutes.

The cost of the previous movie was 50 dollars per minute, so the cost of the previous movie was 120 * 50 = 6000 dollars.

The new movie cost twice as much per minute to film, so the cost per minute is 2 * 50 = 100 dollars. The total cost of the new movie is 132 * 100 = 13200 dollars.

So the answer is:

Answer: 13200
