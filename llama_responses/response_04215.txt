Let's break it down step by step:

1. It takes John 2 hours to draw each picture.
2. It takes John 30% less time to color each picture. This means that the time spent coloring each picture is 2 hours - 30% of 2 hours = 1.4 hours.
3. Since John draws and colors 10 pictures, the total time spent drawing and coloring is:
2 hours (drawing each picture) + 10 x 1.4 hours (coloring each picture) = 20 hours.

Answer: 20
