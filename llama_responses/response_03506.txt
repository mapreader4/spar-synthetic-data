Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Rosie pays with a $1 bill and a $.44 piece of candy. So, the cashier will give her the change in cents.

Since the cashier will give Rosie the smallest number of coins possible, let's think about the possible combinations of coins she can get.

A $1 bill is equal to 100 cents, so we can subtract the 44 cents from the 100 cents to get the remaining change. 100 - 44 = 56 cents.

Now, we need to convert the 56 cents into the smallest number of coins possible. We can make 56 cents with 25 quarters, 1 quarter, and 1 penny.
