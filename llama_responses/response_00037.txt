Let's break down the cost of the items:

5 pieces of hamburger that cost $3 each = 5 x 3 = 15 dollars
4 sets of French fries that cost $1.20 each = 4 x 1.20 = 4.80 dollars
5 cups of soda that cost $0.5 each = 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 dollars
1 platter of spaghetti that cost $2.7 = 2.7 dollars

Total cost = 15 + 4.80 + 2.5 + 2.7 = 24.10

Since there are 5 friends, they will split the bill equally, so each friend will pay:

24.10 / 5 = 4.82

Answer: 4.82
