Let's break this problem down step by step.

Lindsey buys 2 exercise bands that each add 5 pounds of resistance. This means that the total additional resistance from the bands is 5 x 2 = 10 pounds.

Lindsey doubles up both sets of bands and places them around her legs. This means that the total additional resistance from the doubled bands is still 10 pounds.

Now, she picks up a 10-pound dumbbell. This means that the total weight she will be squatting is 10 pounds from the dumbbell + 10 pounds from the doubled bands = 20 pounds.

Answer: 20
