Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of making the 6 cookies. Each cookie costs $0.25, so the total cost to make the 6 cookies is 6 * 0.25 = $1.50. The profit from selling the cookies is the total revenue minus the cost of making the cookies. The total revenue is 6 * 1.5 = $9, so the profit is $9 - $1.5 = $7.5. Since the profit is split evenly between the two charities, each charity gets $3.75. Answer: 3.75.
