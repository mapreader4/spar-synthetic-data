Let's break it down step by step.

There are 3 snakes. The first snake is 2 feet long. 2 feet is equal to 24 inches. The second snake is 16 inches long. 16 inches is equal to 16 inches. The third snake is 10 inches long. 10 inches is equal to 10 inches.

To find the total length of all the snakes, we need to add the lengths of each snake. 24 inches + 16 inches + 10 inches is equal to 40 inches.
