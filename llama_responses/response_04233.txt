Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many bags of potatoes James needs. Since each person eats 1.5 pounds of potatoes, and there are 40 people, the total amount of potatoes needed is 40 x 1.5 = 60 pounds.

Next, let's find out how many 20-pound bags of potatoes that is needed. 60 pounds is equal to 60 / 20 = 3 bags.

Finally, let's find out how much it costs. Each bag of potatoes costs 5 dollars. So, 3 bags will cost 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.

Answer: 15
