Let's start by identifying the number of married people and children.

The number of married people is 30% of 1000, which is 0.3 * 1000 = 300.

The number of children is 1000 - 300 = 700.

To find the difference between the number of married people and the number of children, we subtract the number of children from the number of married people:

300 - 700 = 100.

Answer: 100.
