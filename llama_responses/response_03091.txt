Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the number of sodas Marcy had initially, which is 22.

Tina gave her 12 plus two times the number of sodas Marcy had before. Two times the number of sodas Marcy had is 2 * 22 = 44. So, Tina gave her 44 sodas.

Add the number of sodas Marcy had initially, 22, to the number of sodas Tina gave her, 44. This gives us the total number of sodas Marcy has now:

22 + 44 = 66

So, Marcy will have 66 sodas for the party.

Answer: 66
