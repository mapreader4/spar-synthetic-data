Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the distance from Anthony's apartment to work. The distance is given as 10 miles. 

Now, we are told that the gym is 2 miles more than half the distance from his apartment to work. So, let's find the half distance from his apartment to work first. 

Half of 10 miles is 5 miles. 

The gym is 2 miles more than this distance, so we add 2 miles to 5 miles to find the distance from his apartment to the gym. 

5 + 2 = 7

So, the gym is 7 miles away from his apartment.
