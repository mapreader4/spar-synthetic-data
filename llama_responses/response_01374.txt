Let's start by identifying the number of books Darla has. Darla has 6 books. Katie has half as many books as Darla, so Katie has 6 / 2 = 3 books. Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined. Darla and Katie have 6 + 3 = 9 books combined. So, 6 + 3 = 9. So, Gary has 5 * 9 = 45 books. The total number of books the three have is 6 + 3 + 45 = 54.
