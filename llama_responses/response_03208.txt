Let's break this problem down step by step.

Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. So, she has 20 pencils.

Then, she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. So, she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils.

On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she bought on Tuesday, which is 3 x 18 = 54. So, she buys 54 pencils.

So, in total, Sarah has 20 + 38 + 54 = 112 pencils.
