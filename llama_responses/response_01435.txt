Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to convert all the coins into the same unit, which is the penny.

10 quarters = 10 x 25 cents = 250 cents
3 dimes = 3 x 10 cents = 30 cents
3 nickels = 3 x 5 cents = 15 cents
5 pennies = 5 x 1 cent = 5 cents

Now, we add up the values of the coins to find the total amount of money Harriet found:

250 cents + 30 cents + 15 cents + 5 cents = 300 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

300 cents รท 100 = 3 dollars
