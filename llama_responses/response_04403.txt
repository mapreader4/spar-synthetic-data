Let's break this problem down step by step!

1. Manny wants one piece, so that's one piece accounted for.
2. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much, so he'll only eat garlic bread and salad. He won't eat any lasagna, so that's zero pieces.
3. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Since Manny wants one piece, Kai will eat two pieces (twice Manny's one piece).
4. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does. Since Manny wants one piece, Raphael will eat half of that, which is 0.5 pieces. But Lisa will eat any leftover piece from Raphael, so we need to add 0.5 pieces to the total. This means Raphael will eat 0.5 pieces, and Lisa will eat the remaining 0.5 pieces, making it a total of 1 piece for Raphael and Lisa.
5. Now, let's add up the total number of pieces: Manny (1), Kai (2), Raphael and Lisa (1), and Aaron (0). This gives us a total of 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 4 pieces.
