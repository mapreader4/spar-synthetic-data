Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate the time it takes to dry a short-haired dog like a beagle. It takes 10 minutes. 

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to dry a full-haired, fluffy dog like a german shepherd. It takes twice as long, so it takes 10 * 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we have 6 short-haired dogs and 9 full-haired dogs. The total number of dogs is 6 + 9 = 15 dogs.

To dry 6 short-haired dogs, it takes 10 minutes. To dry 9 full-haired dogs, it takes 20 minutes. So, the total time it takes to dry all the dogs is the sum of these two times: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

To convert the minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 30 รท 60 = 0.5 hours.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 0.5
