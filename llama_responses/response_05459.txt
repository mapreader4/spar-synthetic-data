Let's break this problem down step by step:

The bus driver drives for 5 days, so we need to multiply the hours he drives each day by 5.

The driver drives for 2 hours each day, so the total hours driven is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

From Monday to Wednesday, the bus driver drives at an average speed of 12 kilometers per hour. So, the distance covered is 12 * 2 = 24 kilometers.

From Thursday to Friday, the bus driver drives at an average speed of 9 kilometers per hour. So, the distance covered is 9 * 2 = 18 kilometers.

The total distance driven is the sum of the distance driven from Monday to Wednesday and Thursday to Friday. So, the total distance driven is 24 + 18 = 42 kilometers.

Answer: 42
