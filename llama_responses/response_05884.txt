Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of track medals Jameson has: 5.

He has two times as many swimming medals as track medals, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 medals.

He has 20 medals in total. 5 + 10 = 15. So, he has 15 track medals.

The rest of the medals are for badminton. So, the number of badminton medals is 20 - 15 = 5.

Answer: 5
