Let's break this down step by step.

There are 2 birds nests with 5 eggs each in 1 tree, so that is 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

There is also 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree, so that is 1 x 3 = 3 eggs.

There is also a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard, so that is 1 x 4 = 4 eggs.

Adding all the eggs together, we get 10 + 3 + 4 = 17 eggs.

Answer: 17
