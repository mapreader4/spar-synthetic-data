Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many crayons Martha has initially. Martha has 18 crayons.

Then, she lost half of them. Half of 18 is 9. So, Martha has 18 - 9 = 9 crayons left.

Now, she bought a new set of 20 crayons. So, Martha has 9 crayons initially and 20 crayons. To find the total number of crayons she has, we need to add 9 and 20. 9 + 20 = 29.

Answer: 29
