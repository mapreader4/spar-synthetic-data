I will solve the problem step by step, stating my reasoning before stating the answer.

To find the new price of the movie ticket, I will subtract the discount from the original price.

The original price is $100. The discount is 20% of the original price, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20.

To find the new price, I will subtract the discount from the original price:

100 - 20 = 80

Answer: 80
