Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of nails Jill is painting.

She is painting 20 nails.

Next, let's find the number of nails painted blue:

6 nails are painted blue.

Next, let's find the number of nails painted striped:

The remaining nails are painted striped, so we subtract the number of nails painted blue from the total number of nails:

20 - 6 = 14

So, 14 nails are painted striped.

Now, we need to find the percentage of nails painted blue:

(6 / 20) * 100 = 30%

And we need to find the percentage of nails painted striped:

(14 / 20) * 100 = 70%

Now, we need to find the difference between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped:

30% - 70%

To find the difference, we subtract the smaller percentage from the larger one:

70 - 30 = 40

So, the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped is 40%.

Answer: 40
