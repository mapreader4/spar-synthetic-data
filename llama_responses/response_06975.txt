Let's break it down step by step:

Let's first find the rate at 1 km that Ben can travel in 2 hours. We know that 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, and we know that 1 km is equal to 1000 meters. So, Ben can travel 1000 meters in 2 hours, which means his speed is 1000/2 = 500 meters per minute.

Now, to find the time it would take him to travel 12 km, we need to divide 12000 meters (12 km) by his speed. 12000/500 = 24 minutes.
