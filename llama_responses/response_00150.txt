Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us: Angela is a bike messenger who needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals. 

We are given the total number of packages and meals combined, which is 27. 

To find the number of meals, we need to divide the total number of packages and meals combined by 8. 

27 รท 8 = 3.25

So, Angela delivers 3.25 meals.
