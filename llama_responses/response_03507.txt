Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the amount of money Ella makes from babysitting last year.

Let's call this amount M.

Since Ella spent 40% of the money she makes from babysitting on video games, we know that 40% of M = 100.

To find the value of M, we can divide 100 by 40%:

M = 100 / 0.4 = 250

So, Ella makes $250 from babysitting last year.

Now, let's find Ella's new salary after the 10% raise.

Her new salary is 10% more than her old salary. We can add 10% of her old salary to her old salary to find her new salary:

New salary = Old salary + (10% of old salary)

New salary = 250 + (10% of 250)

New salary = 250 + 25
