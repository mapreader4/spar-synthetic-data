Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of steps Mabel lives east of the school. Mabel lives 4500 steps east of the school.

Step 2: Find the number of steps Helen lives west of the school. Helen lives 3/4 the number of steps Mabel lives east of the school. So, Helen lives (4500 / 4) steps west of the school.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of steps Mabel will walk to visit Helen. Mabel lives 4500 steps east of the school, and Helen lives (4500 / 4) steps west of the school. The total number of steps Mabel will walk is the sum of these two distances, which is:

4500 + (4500 / 4) = 1125 steps.

Answer: 1125
