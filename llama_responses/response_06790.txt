Let's break it down step by step:

Let x be the number of chickens Colten has.  Let y be the number of chickens Skylar has.  Let z be the number of chickens Quentin has.

We know that Quentin has 25 more chickens than Skylar has, so we can write an equation to represent this:

z - 2y = 25

We know that Skylar has 4 less chickens than Colten has, so we can write another equation to represent this:

z = y - 3

Now we know that Quentin has 25 more chickens than Skylar has, and Skylar has 4 less chickens than Colten has.  So we can substitute z - 2y = 25 into our first equation:

z - 2( y - 3) = 25

We can solve for y:

y - 3 = 13

So we know that y = 16.

Now we can substitute y = 16 into our second equation:

z = 16 - 3

So we know that z = 13.

So Colten has 13 chickens.  So the answer is:

Answer: 13
