Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Mrs. Smith wants to buy something worth $500.

Step 2: She goes to the boutique with the $500.

Step 3: She picks out everything she likes, but realizes she needs more money.

Step 4: She needs two-fifths more money than she has.

Step 5: The shop owner gives her a discount of 15%.

Let's find out how much more money she needs.

The total amount she needs is 2/5 of the 500, which is 200. Since she has 500, she needs 200 more. But the shop owner gives her a 15% discount, so she will get 500 - 0.15*500 = 425. So, she will need 200 - 425 = 75.

Answer: 75
