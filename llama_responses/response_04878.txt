Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of plants initially. There are 30 plants in the garden.

The bugs ate 20 plants the first day, so there are 30 - 20 = 10 plants left.

The next day, the bugs ate half of the remaining plants. Half of 10 is 5. So, there are 10 - 5 = 5 plants left.

Finally, the bugs ate 1 more plant, so there are 5 - 1 = 4 plants left.

Answer: 4
