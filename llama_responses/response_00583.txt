Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water per minute.  Since it's a 2-hour period, the amount of water leaked from the largest hole in 2 hours is:

3 ounces per minute * 120 minutes (2 hours) = 360 ounces

2. The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole.  So, the rate of the medium-sized hole is:

3 ounces per minute / 2 = 1.5 ounces per minute

In 2 hours, the amount of water leaked from the medium-sized hole is:

1.5 ounces per minute * 120 minutes = 180 ounces

3. The smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.  So, the rate of the smallest hole is:

1.5 ounces per minute / 3 = 0.5 ounces per minute

In 2 hours, the amount of water leaked from the smallest hole is:

0.5 ounces per minute * 120 minutes = 60 ounces

4. Now, we need to add up the amount of water leaked from all three holes:

360 ounces (largest hole) + 180 ounces (medium-sized hole) + 60 ounces (smallest hole) = 600 ounces

Answer: 600
