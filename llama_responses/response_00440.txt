Let x be the age of Cori's aunt today.

Since Cori is 3 years old, and in 5 years, she will be one-third the age of her aunt, we can set up an equation to solve for x, the age of her aunt.

3 + 5 = x/3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3.

3 + 5 = 3 * 3

9 = x

So, 9 = x. Therefore, the aunt is 9 years old.
