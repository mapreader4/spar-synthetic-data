Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of stickers she has. She has 50 gold stickers, and she has twice as many silver stickers as gold stickers, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver stickers. Then, she has 20 fewer bronze stickers than silver stickers, so she has 100 - 20 = 80 bronze stickers.

Now, she wants to give the same number of stickers to each of her 5 students. So, she will give each student (100 + 80 + 50) / 5 = 230 / 5 = 46 stickers.
