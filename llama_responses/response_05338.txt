Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of shirts he can iron in an hour. We know that Rick can iron 4 shirts in an hour, so we can represent this as 4 shirts per hour.

We also know that Rick can iron 3 pants in an hour, so we can represent this as 3 pants per hour.

We know that Rick spends 3 hours ironing dress shirts, which is 3 x 4 = 12 shirts.

We also know that Rick spends 5 hours ironing dress pants, which is 5 x 3 = 15 pants.

To find the total number of pieces of clothing ironed, we add the number of shirts and pants ironed:

12 (shirts) + 15 (pants) = 27

So, Rick has ironed 27 pieces of clothing.

Answer: 27
