Let's say the original number is x.

If you double the number and add 5 to the result, it means that you are doubling the original number and then adding 5 to it.

So, the equation is 2x + 5.

Since we know that this is 20 more than half of the original number, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

The equation is 2x + 5 = 20 + x.

To solve for x, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 20 - 5

2x = 15

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 15 / 2

x = 7.5

So, the original number is 7.5.
