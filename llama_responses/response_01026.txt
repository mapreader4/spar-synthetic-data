Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Find Chiquita's height.
Chiquita is 5 feet tall.

Step 2: Find Mr. Martinez's height.
Mr. Martinez is two feet taller than his daughter, so he is 5 + 2 = 7 feet tall.

Step 3: Add their heights together.
Mr. Martinez's height is 7 feet, and Chiquita's height is 5 feet. So, their combined height is 7 + 5 = 12 feet.

Answer: 12
