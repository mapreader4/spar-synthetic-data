Let's break it down step by step.

Yoque borrowed money from her sister. She borrowed some amount of money, which we'll call x.

She promised to pay it back in 11 months, which means she has 11 periods of 1 month each. In each period of 1 month, she pays back the same amount of money. Let's call this amount of money y.

The total amount of money she borrowed, x, is the sum of the money she borrowed and the interest she will pay back. We can write this as an equation:

x = amount borrowed + y * 12

We know that the interest rate is 10% of the money she borrowed. This is given as an additional 10% of the money she borrowed. So, we can write the equation as:

x = y * 1.1

We know that she pays 15 dollars per month, so we know that y = 15. We can substitute this value into the equation:

x = 15 * 1.1 * 12

x = 180

So, the amount of money she borrowed is 180.
