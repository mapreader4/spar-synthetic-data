Let's start by identifying the amount of money Leila spent on jewelry. She spent the rest of her money, which is $20, on jewelry. The amount she spent on the sweater was $40. To find the amount she spent on jewelry, we need to subtract the amount she spent on the sweater from the total amount of money she had. $40 was spent on the sweater, so we subtract $40 from $40. $40 - $40 is $0. Now, we need to find the difference between $0 and the amount she spent on jewelry. The amount she spent on jewelry is $20. The difference between $20 and $0 is $20.
