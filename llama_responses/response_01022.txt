Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's say Rachel's age is x. Then, Leah's age is x - 4.

The sum of their ages is 34, so we can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x - 4) = 34

To solve for x, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation to get:

x - 4 + x = 34 + 4

Combine like terms on the right side of the equation:

x - 4 + x = 38

Subtract 4 from both sides to get:

x = 38 + 4

x = 42

Answer: 42
