Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many eBook readers John and Anna bought.

John bought 15 eBook readers less than Anna did, so Anna bought 15 + 3 eBook readers = 18 eBook readers.

John and Anna together have 15 + 18 eBook readers = 33 eBook readers.

Answer: 33
