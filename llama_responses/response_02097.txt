Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Ali has $5 less than Nada. We can let's say Nada has x dollars, so Ali has x - 5 dollars. 

Then, John has 4 times more than Nada, so John has 4x dollars. 

We know that Ali, Nada, and John have a total of 67 dollars. So, we can set up an equation:

x - 5 + 4x = 67

We can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get:

x + 4x = 72

Then, we can subtract 4 from both sides to get:

x = 18

So, John has 18 dollars.
