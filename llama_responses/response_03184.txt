Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* We bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns.
* Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies.
* Rick bought 30 guppies.

From the first statement, we know that Tim bought x clowns. If we let x be the number of clowns Tim bought, then we can set up an equation:

4x = x

The second statement tells us that Rick bought twice as many clowns as he bought guppies. So, if Rick bought 30 guppies, then Rick bought 30/2 = 15 clowns.

Now, we can substitute this into the equation:

4x = 15

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 15 / 4
x = 3.75

So, we bought 3.75 times as many clowns as tetras as Tim bought clowns.
