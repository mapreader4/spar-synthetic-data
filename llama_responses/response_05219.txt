Let's break down the problem step by step.

Anne breaks the mirror into 60 pieces. Then, she sweeps up half of them. Half of 60 is 30.

So, she has 30 pieces. The cat steals 3 pieces, leaving her with 27 pieces.

Then, her boyfriend picks up 1/3 of the remaining pieces. 1/3 of 27 is 9.

So, her boyfriend picks up 9 pieces.

Answer: 9
