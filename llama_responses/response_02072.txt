Let's break it down step by step.

1. The first popsicle melts completely in 1 minute. Let's call this time "t1".

2. The second popsicle melts twice as fast, which means it takes half the time to melt. So it takes 0.5 minutes to melt.

3. The third popsicle melts twice as fast, which means it takes a quarter of the time to melt. So it takes 0.25 minutes to melt.

4. The fourth popsicle melts twice as fast, which means it takes an eighth of the time to melt. So it takes 0.125 minutes to melt.

5. The fifth popsicle melts twice as fast, which means it takes a sixteenth of the time to melt. So it takes 0.0625 minutes to melt.

6. The sixth popsicle melts twice as fast, which means it takes a thirty-second of the time to melt. So it takes 0.03125 minutes to melt.

6. The last popsicle remains melt.

The last popsicle melts 6 times faster than the first popsicle. The first popsicle melts in 1 minute, so the last popsicle melts in 0.03125 minutes. So the answer is 31.25 times faster.

Answer: 31.25
