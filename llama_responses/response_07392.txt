Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Gina's sister watches x shows in a week. Gina and her sister watch the same shows, so Gina also watches x shows in a week.

Since Gina's sister watches 24 shows in a week, we know that x = 24.

Each show is 50 minutes long, so Gina and her sister watch a total of 50x minutes of shows per week.

We know that Gina and her sister watch the same shows, so Gina also watches 50x minutes of shows per week.

Now, we need to find the total number of minutes of shows Gina gets to choose. We know that 50x = 50x.

We can multiply both sides of the equation to find the value of x. 50x = 50x = 24, so Gina gets 1200 minutes of shows to choose.

Answer: 1200
