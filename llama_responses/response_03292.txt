Let's start by identifying the number of blind students. Let's say the number of blind students is x. Since the school has three times the number of deaf students, we can set up an equation:

x = 3 * 180

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 1:

x = 540

So, the number of blind students is 540.
