Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. Emmy has 14 iPods initially, but she loses 6 of them, so she has 14 - 6 = 8 iPods left. Rosa has twice as many iPods as Emmy, so Rosa has 8 * 2 = 16 iPods. To find the total number of iPods Emmy and Rosa have together, we add the number of iPods Emmy has to the number of iPods Rosa has. 8 + 16 = 24. So, the answer is:

Answer: 24
