Let's break this problem down step by step.

Paula buys 2 bracelets at $4 each, so she spends 2 x 4 = 8 dollars on bracelets. She also buys a keychain at $5, so she spends an additional 5 dollars. In total, Paula spends 8 + 5 = 13 dollars.

Olive buys a coloring book at $3 and a bracelet at $4. She spends 3 + 4 = 7 dollars.

To find the total amount Paula and Olive spend, we add the amounts they spent. 13 + 7 = 20.

Answer: 20
