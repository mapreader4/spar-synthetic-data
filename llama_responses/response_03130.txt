Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the distance Jace travels during the first 4 hours. We know that Jace drives 60 miles per hour, so:

Distance = Rate * Time = 60 * 4 = 240 miles

So, Jace travels 240 miles in the first 4 hours.

Next, he takes a 30-minute break. Since he drives 60 miles per hour, he travels 30 miles during the break.

Finally, Jace drives for another 9 hours. At a rate of 60 miles per hour, he travels:

Distance = Rate * Time = 60 * 9 = 540 miles

Adding the distance he traveled during the break to the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours, Jace travels a total of:

240 + 30 + 540 = 810 miles

Answer: 810
