Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The number of tents in the northernmost part of the campsite is 100.
2. The number of tents on the east side of the grounds is twice the number of tents in the northernmost part, so it's 2 x 100 = 200.
3. The number of tents at the center of the camp is four times the number of tents in the northernmost part, so it's 4 x 100 = 400.
4. The number of tents in the southern part of the campsite is 200.
5. To find the total number of tents in the recreation area, we add up the number of tents in each part: 100 + 200 + 400 + 200 =?

Answer: 800
