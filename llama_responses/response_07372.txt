Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that the distance between city A and city B is 100 miles. We can let x be the distance between city B and city C. We know that the distance between city B and city C is 50 miles more than the distance between city A and city B, so we can set up the equation:

x = 100 + 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 150

Now, we know that the distance between city C and city D is twice the distance between city B and city C. So, we can set up the equation:

Distance between city C and city D = 2x

We know that x is equal to 150, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Distance between city C and city D = 2(150)

Distance between city C and city D = 300

Now, we need to find the total distance between city A and city D. We can add the distances between city A and city B and city B and city C, and then add the distance between city C and city D:

Total distance = distance between city A and city B + distance between city B and city C + distance between city C and city D
= 100 + 150 + 300
= 450

Answer: 450
