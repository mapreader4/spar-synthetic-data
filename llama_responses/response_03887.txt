Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that the two dogs walk a total of 70 miles in a week. We are trying to find the average distance that the other dog walks in a day.

Let's use the formula for average, which is the total divided by the number of days.

The total distance is 70 miles and the number of days is 7, since it's a week.

So, the average distance the other dog walks in a day is 70 divided by 7.

70 divided by 7 is 10.

Answer: 10
