Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter, so if Peter is x years old, Rupert is x + 3.5 years old.

Since Peter has 10 candles on his cake, it means that he is 10 years old. Therefore, Rupert is 10 + 3.5 = 13.5 years old.

Since Rupert has a fraction of a year older than Peter, we can round up the fraction to the nearest whole number. Since 3.5 is the same as 4, we can conclude that Rupert is 14 years old.

Rupert's cake will have 14 candles.
