Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The original dandelion seed produces 50 fluffy, white seeds.
2. Only half of these seeds land on good soil, so 50/2 = 25 seeds land on good soil.
3. Each of these 25 seeds will grow into a new dandelion plant, just like the original plant.
4. Each of these new plants will produce the same number of seeds as the original plant, which is 50.
5. Since each of the 25 new plants will produce 50 seeds, the total number of seeds produced by these new plants will be 25 x 50 = 1250 seeds.

Answer: 1250
