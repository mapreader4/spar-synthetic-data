Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the given information: They are celebrating their 20th anniversary in 2025. We know that they will celebrate their anniversary in 7 years from now. So, to find the year they got married, we need to subtract 20 from 2025 to find the year they got married.

2025 - 20 = 2005.

Now, they started dating 3 years before they got married. So, to find the year they started dating, we need to subtract 3 from 2005 to find the year they started dating.

2005 - 3 = 2002.

So, they met in the year 2002.

Answer: 2002.
