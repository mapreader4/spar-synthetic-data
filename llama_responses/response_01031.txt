Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of people at the beginning of the game, which is 600.

There were 1/4 (one-fourth) of the boys and 1/8 (one-eighth) of the girls who left early, which is the same as saying 1/4 + 1/8 = 9/8 of the total people left the game early.

To find the number of girls at the beginning of the game, we can multiply the total number of people (600) by the fraction of girls who remained, which is 1 - 9/8 = 7/8.

So, the number of girls remaining at the beginning of the game is 600 * 7/8 = 525.

Answer: 525
