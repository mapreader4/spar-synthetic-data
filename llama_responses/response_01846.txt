Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the discount for Bob. The discount for Bob is 5% of the $30 bill, which is:

$30 * 0.05 = $1.5

So, the discounted amount for Bob is $30 - $1.5 = $28.5.

Next, we need to calculate the discount for Kate. The discount for Kate is 2% of the $25 bill, which is:

$25 * 0.02 = $0.5

So, the discounted amount for Kate is $25 - $0.5 = $24.5.

Now, we need to add the discounted amounts together to find the total amount they have to pay. The total amount is:

$28.5 + $24.5 = $52.5
