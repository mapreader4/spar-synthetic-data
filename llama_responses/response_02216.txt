Let's start by finding out how many ml of dye Jenna needs for all the blouses.

Each blouse takes 10 ml of black dye. If there are 100 blouses, then Jenna needs 100 * 10 = 1000 ml of black dye.

The question asks how many 400-ml bottles of dye Jenna needs to buy. Since 1000 ml is more than 400 ml, Jenna needs to buy 3 400-ml bottles of dye.
