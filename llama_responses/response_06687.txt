To solve this problem, I will divide the total change by 3 to find the cost of one soda.

The total change is $14.  The change is the amount left over after John pays with a $20 bill.  So, we will subtract the cost of the sodas from the change.

$20 - $14 = $6

To find the cost of each soda, we will divide the $6 by 3.

$6 / 3 = $2
