Let's break down the information given:

* The novel has half as many pages as their history book.
* The history book has 300 pages.
* The science book has 4 times the amount of pages as their novel.

We can start by identifying the number of pages in the novel:

Novel: x pages
History book: 300 pages
Science book: 4x

Since the novel has half the pages of the history book, we can set up an equation:

x = 300 / 2
x = 150

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the equation for the science book:

Science book: 4 * 150
Science book: 600

Answer: 600
