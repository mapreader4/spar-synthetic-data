Let's start by using variables to represent the cost of the items:

Let M be the cost of the magnet, S be the cost of the sticker, and A be the cost of a single stuffed animal.

We know that the magnet cost 3 times more than the sticker, so:

M = 3S

We also know that the cost of the two stuffed animals is the same as the cost of one stuffed animal, so:

2A = A

We also know that the cost of the magnet is 3 times the cost of the sticker, so:

M = 3S

We also know that the cost of the magnet is $3, so:

3S = 3

We can solve for S:

S = 1

We also know that the cost of the two stuffed animals is the cost of one stuffed animal, so:

2A = A

2A = A

We can solve for A:

A = 6

The cost of a single stuffed animal is 6 dollars.
