Let's start by finding the total number of strawberries picked by Kimberly and her family. Her brother picked 3 baskets of 15 strawberries each, so that's 3 x 15 = 45 strawberries. Kimberly picked 8 times the amount her brother picked, so she picked 8 x 45 = 360 strawberries. The total number of strawberries picked by Kimberly and her family is 360 + 45 = 405 strawberries. If they divide the total number of strawberries equally, each person would get 405 รท 4 = 101.25 strawberries.
