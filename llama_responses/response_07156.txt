To find the time it took Rich to run a mile, we can divide the total time by the total distance. The total distance is 24 miles. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 minutes in 1 mile. So, we can convert the distance from miles to minutes by multiplying by 60. So, the total time in minutes is 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes. Then, we divide that by 24, to find the time it took to run a mile. 1440 / 24 = 60. So, it took Rich 60 minutes to run a mile.
