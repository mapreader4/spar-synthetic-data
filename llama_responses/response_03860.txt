Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. There are 52 cards in a standard deck of cards.
2. There are 4 hearts on a card.
3. So, the number of hearts is 4 * 52 = 208.
4. The cows are sold at $200 each.
5. To find the total cost, multiply the number of cows by the cost of each cow.
6. The total cost is 208 * 200 = 41,600.

Answer: 41,600
