Let's break this down step by step.

We know that the total cost of the accident is $40,000 + $70,000 = $110,000.

We also know that Carl's insurance company will pay 80% of the costs. To find the amount they will pay, we multiply the total cost by 0.8:

$110,000 * 0.8 = $88,000

This means that Carl's insurance company will pay $88,000.

To find the amount Carl will have to pay, we subtract the amount the insurance company will pay from the total cost:

$110,000 - $88,000 = $22,000

Carl will have to pay $22,000.

Answer: 22000
