Let's break down the costs first. Biff spent a total of $11 + $3 + $16 = $30 on the ticket, drinks, and headphones.

He will need to make enough money to cover this cost. He makes $12/hour, but has to pay $2/hour for WiFi. So, his net earnings per hour are $12 - $2 = $10.

To find out how many hours he needs to work to break even, we can divide the total cost by his net earnings per hour:

$30 รท $10 = 3

So, Biff needs to work for 3 hours to break even. However, this is not the answer to the original question, which asks for the length of the bus ride. Since he needs to work for 3 hours to break even, the bus ride will need to be at least 3 hours long for him to break even.

Answer: 3
