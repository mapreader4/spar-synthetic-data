Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start with Olaf, who is 15 years old.

Beckett is 12 years younger than Olaf, so Beckett is 15 - 3 = 12 years old.

Shannen is 2 years younger than Olaf, so Shannen is 15 - 2 = 13 years old.

Jack is 5 more than twice as old as Shannen, so Jack is 5 + 2 x 13 = 25 years old.

The sum of the ages of all 4 people is Olaf's age, plus Beckett's age, plus Shannen's age, plus Jack's age.

Olaf's age is 15, Beckett's age is 12, Shannen's age is 13, and Jack's age is 25.

Adding these up, we get 15 + 12 + 13 + 25 = 60.

Answer: 60
