Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the remaining amount Lyka needs to buy the smartphone.

The smartphone costs $160, but Lyka has $40. So, the remaining amount she needs is $160 - $40 = $120.

Step 2: Determine how many weeks she needs to save for the remaining amount.

Lyka needs to save for 2 months. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she needs to save for 2 * 4 = 8 weeks.

Step 3: Calculate how much she needs to save per week.

To find out how much Lyka needs to save per week, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of weeks. $120 / 8 = $15.
