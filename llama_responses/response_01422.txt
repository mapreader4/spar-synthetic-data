Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of accidents in 10 seconds:

1. In 10 seconds, there is 1 accident.
2. In 20 seconds, there is 1 accident.
3. Since accidents happen in a sequence, we can assume that the number of accidents in 10 seconds is the same as the number of accidents in 20 seconds.

So, the number of accidents in 10 seconds is 1. Now, we need to find the number of accidents in 40 seconds. We know that accidents happen every 10 seconds, so in 40 seconds, there will be 4 accidents.

Now, we can find the number of accidents in 40 seconds:

1. In 10 seconds, there is 1 accident.
2. In 20 seconds, there is 1 accident.
3. In 30 seconds, there is 1 accident.
4. In 40 seconds, there is 1 accident.

So, the number of accidents in 40 seconds is 3.

So, the number of accidents in 40 seconds is 3. Now, we can find the number of accidents in 4 minutes. Since accidents happen every 20 seconds, we can find the number of accidents in 4 minutes by multiplying the number of accidents in 40 seconds by 12 (since 4 minutes is 24 times 20 seconds):

1. 3 accidents in 40 seconds * 12 = 36

So, the number of accidents in 4 minutes is 36.

Answer: 36
