Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how much Theodore earns in a month.

He crafts 10 stone statues and 20 wooden statues, which is a total of 30 statues. The cost of a stone statue is $20 and a wooden statue is $5. So, the total cost of all the statues is:

10 x $20 = $200 (stone statues)
20 x $5 = $100 (wooden statues)
Total cost = $200 + $100 = $300

So, Theodore earns $300 in a month.

Now, he pays 10% of his total earnings in taxes. 10% of $300 is:

$300 x 0.1 = $30

So, his total earnings after taxes are:

$300 - $30 = $270

Answer: 270
