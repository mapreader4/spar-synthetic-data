Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Carly sent 200 job applications to companies in her state. Let's say that is 200.

Step 2: Carly also sent twice that number, or 200 x 2, to companies in other states. Let's multiply 200 by 2 to get the total number of job applications she sent to other states.

Step 3: To find the total number of job applications she has sent so far, we add the number of job applications sent to her state to the number of job applications sent to other states. So, the total number of job applications is 200 + 200 x 2 = 200 + 400 = 600.

Answer: 600
