Let's break down the total distance into two parts: the distance from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas and the distance from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.

The distance from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas is 420 miles. The distance from Las Vegas to Los Angeles is 273 miles. To find the total distance, we add the two distances: 420 + 273 = 693 miles.

Now, we need to find the average speed. We can use the formula: Speed = Total Distance / Time. We know the total distance and the time. We need to find the average speed.

Let's use the formula: Speed = Total Distance / Time. The time given is 11 hours. We can convert the time to hours to minutes: 11 * 60 = 660 minutes.

Now, we can plug in the values: Speed = 693 miles / 660 minutes.

Speed = 693 / 660 = 1.05 miles per minute.

Andy needs to drive at a speed of 1.05 miles per minute to reach Los Angeles in 11 hours.
