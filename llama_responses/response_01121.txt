Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with what we know:

* Alice has 60 pens.
* Clara has 2/5 as many pens as Alice, which means Clara has 60/5 = 12 pens.
* Alice's age is 20.
* Clara is older than Alice.

Let's find the age difference between Alice and Clara. Since Clara is older, we can subtract Alice's age from Clara's age to find the age difference.

Clara's age = Alice's age + age difference

We know Clara's age is unknown, so let's call it 'x'. So, we can write:

x = Clara's age = Alice's age + age difference

We know Alice's age is 20, so:

x = 20 + age difference

We know Clara has 12 pens, which is 2/5 as many pens as Alice. So, the age difference is:

age difference = 12 - 20 = -8

So, the age difference is -8.

Clara is 8 years older than Alice.

Now, we need to find Clara's age in 5 years to come. We can add the age difference to Clara's age to find her age in 5 years.

Clara's age in 5 years = Clara's age + age difference = 8 + 5 = 13

Answer: 13
