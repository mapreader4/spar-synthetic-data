Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of the flashlight. The flashlight was 20% of the cost of the hoodie, which is $80. So, the cost of the flashlight is 20% of $80, which is 20% x $80. To find 20% of a number, we can multiply the number by 0.20. So, 0.20 x $80 = $16.

Now, let's find the cost of the boots. The boots were originally $110, but due to a special promotion, they were 10% cheaper. So, the cost of the boots is 100% - 10% of $110. 100% - 10% is 90%, so the cost of the boots is 0.90 x $110. 0.90 x $110 = $99.

Now, let's add the cost of the flashlight and the cost of the boots together. The cost of the flashlight is $16 and the cost of the boots is $99. $16 + $99 = $115.

So, Celina spent a total of $115 on the equipment.
