Let's start by finding the total amount of money Lilith would have gotten if she sold her water bottles at $2 each. She has 5 dozen water bottles, which is equal to 5 x 12 = 60 water bottles. If she sells each bottle for $2, she would get:

60 x $2 = $120

However, she ended up selling the water bottles at $1.85 each. To find the total amount of money she got, we multiply the number of bottles by the new price:

60 x $1.85 = $111

So, Lilith ended up with $111. Since this is less than the original amount she would have gotten, she will need to find the difference to buy her friend's birthday gift. The difference is:

$120 - $111 = $9
