Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Find the time it takes to take route A to Boston and back to his home.

The time it takes to take route A to Boston is 5 hours. To go back home, it will take the same amount of time, so the total time taken for route A is 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours.

Step 2: Find the time it takes to take route B to Boston and back to his home.

The time it takes to take route B to Boston is 2 hours. To go back home, it will take the same amount of time, so the total time taken for route B is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in time taken for the two routes.

The time saved by taking route B is the difference between the time taken for route A and the time taken for route B, which is 10 hours - 4 hours = 6 hours.
