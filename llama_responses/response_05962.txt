Let's break this problem down step by step:

Let's first find the total cost of the items before the discount.

The t-shirt is $30, the backpack is $10, and the blue cap is $5. So the total cost is:

$30 + $10 + $5 = $45

Since Charles paid $43, we can set up an equation to find the discount:

$45 = $43

To solve for the discount, we can subtract the discount from the total cost:

$45 - $2 = $43

The store gave Charles a discount of $2.
