Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, Bruce has $71 dollars to spend on clothes.

He buys 5 shirts that cost $5 each. That's a total of 5 * 5 = $25.

Then, he buys a pair of pants that cost $26.

So, the total cost of the clothes he bought is $25 + $26 = $51.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the initial $71 he had:

$71 - $51 = $20

So, Bruce has $20 left to buy more clothes.
