Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total value of the gold quarters. If each quarter weighs 1/5 of an ounce, then the number of ounces of gold that Carlos has is the total number of quarters divided by 1/5.

Let's let x be the total number of quarters. Then, the number of ounces of gold Carlos has is x / 5.

The value of the gold in ounces is the number of ounces multiplied by the price per ounce, which is 100. So, the total value of the gold is x / 5 * 100.

The value of the gold if he spends them in a store is the regular amount, which is not given. Let's call this value y. Then, we can set up the equation:

x / 5 * 100 = y

Now, we need to find the number of times more money Carlos would get from melting them down. Let's call this value z. Then, we can set up another equation:

z * 100 = y

To find z, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100:

z = y / 100

Now, we can substitute the first equation with the second:

x / 5 * 100 = (x / 5 * 100) / 100

We can simplify this by dividing both sides by 100:

x / 5 = x / 100

Now, we can cancel the x's:

1 / 5 = 1 / 100

So, Carlos would get 20 times more money from melting them down instead of spending them in a store.
