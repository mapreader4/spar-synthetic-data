Let's break this problem down step by step.

Day 1: They traveled at 5 miles per hour for 7 hours, so they traveled a total of:

5 mph x 7 hours = 35 miles

Day 2: They traveled at 6 miles per hour for 6 hours, so they traveled a total of:

6 mph x 6 hours = 36 miles

Then, they traveled at half of that speed (3 miles per hour) for 3 hours, so they traveled a total of:

3 mph x 3 hours = 9 miles

Adding the distances from both days, they traveled a total of:

35 miles + 36 miles + 9 miles = 80 miles

Day 3: They traveled at 7 miles per hour for 5 hours, so they traveled a total of:

7 mph x 5 hours = 35 miles

Adding this to the total, they traveled a total of:

80 miles + 35 miles = 115 miles

Answer: 115
