Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the amusement park tickets. The cost of the tickets is $18 for one person, and there are 4 people going (Jeremie and her 3 friends), so the total cost of the tickets is 4 x $18 = $72.

Next, let's find the cost of the snacks. The cost of a set of snacks is $5, and there are 4 people, so the total cost of the snacks is 4 x $5 = $20.

To find the total cost of the amusement park and snacks, we need to add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the snacks. The total cost is $72 + $20 = $92.

Answer: 92
