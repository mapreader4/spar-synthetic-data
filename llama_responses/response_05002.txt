Let's break this down step by step.

Let's let the number of Oreos Jordan has be x.

James has 3 more than 2 times the number of Oreos Jordan has, so James has 2x + 3 Oreos.

We know that there are a total of 36 Oreos. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 3 = 36

We can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get:

2x = 33

So, x = 33/2 = 16.5

Since we can't have a fraction of an Oreo, we know that James must have 17 Oreos.

Answer: 17
