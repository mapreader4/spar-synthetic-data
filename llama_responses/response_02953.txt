Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of pies eaten by each person:

* Adam eats 3 more pies than Bill.
* Sierra eats twice as many pies as Bill.
* Sierra ate 12 pies.

We know that Sierra ate 12 pies, and she eats twice as many pies as Bill. So, Bill must have eaten 12 / 2 = 6 pies.
* Adam eats 3 more pies than Bill, so Adam must have eaten 6 + 3 = 9 pies.

Now, let's add up the number of pies eaten by each person:

12 (Sierra) + 9 (Adam) + 6 (Bill) = 27

So, in total, 27 pies were eaten in the pie-eating contest.
