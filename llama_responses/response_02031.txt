Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of questions Martin answered correctly is x.

We know that Kelsey answered 8 more questions correctly than Martin, so Kelsey's number of correct answers is x + 8.

We know that Campbell answered 35 questions correctly, and Kelsey's number of correct answers is greater than Martin's, so we can set up an equation:

x + 8 = 35

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 35 - 8
x = 27

So, Martin answered 27 questions correctly.

Answer: 27
