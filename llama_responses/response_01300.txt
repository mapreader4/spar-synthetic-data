Let's break down the time Martin spends waiting in traffic and trying to get off the freeway step by step.

Martin spends 2 hours waiting in traffic. That's the first part of the time he wastes.

Then, he spends 4 times as long trying to get off the freeway. Since he spends 2 hours waiting in traffic, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours trying to get off the freeway.

To find the total time Martin wastes, we add the time he spends waiting in traffic and the time he spends trying to get off the freeway.

2 hours (waiting in traffic) + 8 hours (trying to get off the freeway) = 10 hours

So, Martin wastes a total of 10 hours.
