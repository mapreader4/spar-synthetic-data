Let's start by identifying what we know:

* Duke needs 17 points to tie the record, but he breaks the record by 5 points, so he scores 17 + 5 = 22 points in total.
* The old record is 257 points, so Duke scores 22 points, which means he scores 257 + 5 = 262 points in total.
* Duke scores 5 free throws, which is 5 points.
* He scores 4 regular baskets, which is 4 x 2 = 8 points.
* He normally scores 2 three-pointers a game, so in the final game, he scored 2 x? =? three-pointers.

We can set up an equation to represent the number of three-pointers he scored in the final game:

2 +? = x

We know that the total points he scored is 22, so we can set up an equation to represent the total points:

5 (free throws) + 8 (regular baskets) + 2x (three-pointers) = 22

Combine like terms:

5 + 8 + 2x = 22

Add 5 and 8:

13 + 2x = 22

Subtract 13 from both sides:

2x = 9

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 4.5

Since you can't score a fraction of a three-pointer, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Duke scored 4 three-pointers in the final game, which is 2 more than his normal amount.
