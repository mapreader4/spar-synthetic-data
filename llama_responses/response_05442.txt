Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins.

The ukuleles have 2 x 4 strings = 8 strings.
The guitars have 4 x 6 strings = 24 strings.
The violins have x strings, which we don't know yet. Let's call this unknown number of strings "v".

The total number of strings is 8 + 24 + v = 40.

We can set up an equation to solve for v: 8 + 24 + v = 40.

Subtract 8 and 24 from both sides of the equation to get: v = 8.

So, Francis' family has 8 violins.
