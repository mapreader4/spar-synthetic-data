Let's start by using the information given that Felix's brother can lift three times his weight off the ground. Since his brother can lift 600 pounds, we know that 600 is three times his weight. So, we can divide 600 by 3 to find his weight: 600 รท 3 = 200. Felix's brother weighs 200 pounds.

Now, Felix can lift 1.5 times more than he weighs, so we can multiply his weight by 1.5 to find his weight: 200 * 1.5 = 300. So, Felix can lift 300 pounds off the ground.
