Let's break down the problem step by step:

Johnny runs around the block 4 times, which is 4 x 200 = 800 meters.

Mickey runs around the block half as many times as Johnny, so Mickey runs 4/2 = 2 times around the block.

To find the total distance run by Johnny and Mickey, we add their distances: 800 (Johnny) + 2 (Mickey) = 802.

So, the answer is: Answer: 802
