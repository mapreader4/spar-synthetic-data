To find the number of seeds Bob can plant in each row, we need to find the number of inches in a row, and then divide that by the space each seed needs.

The length of each row is 120 feet, and each seed needs 18 inches, so to find the number of seeds, we divide 120 by 12.

120 / 12 = 10

Answer: 10
