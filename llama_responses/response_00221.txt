Let's break this down step by step.

1. Mira jogs 5 miles per hour.
2. She jogs for 2 hours every morning.
3. To find the total distance she jogs in one day, we multiply the distance she jogs per hour by the number of hours she jogs in a day: 5 miles/hour * 2 hours = 10 miles.
4. Since she jogs for 5 days, we multiply the distance she jogs in one day by the number of days: 10 miles * 5 = 50 miles.

Answer: 50
