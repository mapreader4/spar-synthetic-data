To find the combined population of both states, we can start by finding the population of New York state and New England.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of New York state is approximately 20.2 million. Since New England is a region, we can find the population of the states in New England by adding up the populations of each state.

The states in New England are: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, and Massachusetts.

The populations of each state are:

* Connecticut: approximately 3.2 million
* Maine: approximately 1.3 million
* Massachusetts: approximately 7.1 million
* New Hampshire: approximately 1.3 million
* Rhode Island: approximately 1.1 million
* Vermont: approximately 643,000
* New York: approximately 20.2 million

Now, we can add up the populations to find the total population of New England:

3,200,000 + 1,300,000 + 7,100,000 + 1,300,000 + 1,100,000 + 643,000 + 20,200,000 = 24,643,000

So, the combined population of both states is approximately 24,643,000.
