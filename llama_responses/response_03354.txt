Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the car. The car costs 18000 € and Mr. Lalande pays 3000 € upfront, so the total amount left to be paid is 18000 - 3000 = 15000 €.

Now, Mr. Lalande has to pay the remaining 15000 € in 6 installments. To find the monthly payment, we can divide 15000 by 6:

15000 / 6 = 2500 €

So, Mr. Lalande has to pay 2500 € every month.
