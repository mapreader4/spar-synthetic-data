Let's start by identifying the number of students who are reading.

The number of girls is 12 and the number of boys is 10. The number of girls who are reading is 5/6 of 12, so it is 10. The number of boys who are reading is 4/5 of 10, so it is 8.

So, the total number of students who are not reading is 12 - (10 + 10) = 22 - 18 = 4.
