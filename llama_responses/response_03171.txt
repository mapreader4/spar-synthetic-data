Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total area of the 5 boxes that measure 15 inches by 30 inches. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so the area of each box is 15 x 30 = 450 square inches. Since there are 5 boxes, the total area is 5 x 450 = 2250 square inches.

Next, let's find the area of the 2 boxes that measure 40 inches square. Since they are 40 inches by 40 inches, the area is 40 x 40 = 1600 square inches. Since there are 2 boxes, the total area is 2 x 1600 = 3200 square inches.

Now, let's add the total area of the 5 boxes and the 2 boxes. 2250 + 3200 = 5450 square inches.

The problem asks for the amount of tape needed, not the total area. Since each box requires 3 pieces of tape, and the total area is in square inches, we need to convert the area to linear inches. To do this, we can divide the total area by 3. 5450 square inches / 3 = 1816.67 linear inches.
