Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Euston had 20 more carriages than Norfolk.
* Norwich had 100 carriages.
* Flying Scotsman had 20 more carriages than Norwich.

We can start by subtracting the number of carriages in Norfolk from the number of carriages in Euston to get the number of carriages in Euston minus Norfolk:

Euston had 20 more carriages than Norfolk, so Euston - Norfolk = 20 - 0 = 20 carriages.

Next, we can subtract the number of carriages in Norwich from the number of carriages in Euston to get the number of carriages in Euston minus Norwich:

Euston had 20 carriages than Norwich, so Euston - Norwich = 20 - 20 = 0 carriages.

Now, we can add the number of carriages in Norfolk and the number of carriages in Euston minus Norfolk to get the total number of carriages in Euston:

Euston had 20 carriages - 0 = 20 carriages.

Then, we can add the number of carriages in Norwich to the total:

Euston had 20 carriages + 100 carriages = 120 carriages.

Finally, we can add the number of carriages in Flying Scotsman to the total:

Euston had 120 carriages + 20 carriages = 140 carriages.

Answer: 140
