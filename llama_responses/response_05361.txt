Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many dishes have mangoes or mango salsa. The problem states that the restaurant has mangoes in a sixth of its dishes, which means that there are 6 dishes with mangoes.

Then, we need to find out how many dishes have mango jelly. The problem states that there is mango jelly in one dish, so that's one dish.

Now, we need to subtract the dishes with mangoes and mango jelly from the total number of dishes. We know that Oliver won't eat dishes with mangoes, so we subtract 2 dishes from the 6 dishes with mangoes. We also subtract the dish with mango jelly, so we subtract 1 dish.

So, the total number of dishes left for Oliver is:

6 - 2 - 1 = 3

Answer: 3
