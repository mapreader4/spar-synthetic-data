Let's start by identifying the given information: Sarah bought 6 paperback books, and her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah bought. Since Sarah bought 6 paperback books, one-third of that amount is 2. So her brother bought 2 paperback books.

Next, we know that her brother bought two times the number of hardback books that she bought. The number of hardback books she bought is 4. So, her brother bought 2 * 4 = 8 hardback books.

In total, her brother bought 2 paperback books + 8 hardback books. 2 + 8 = 10.
