Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total time Olive charged her phone for. Since she charged it for 10 hours, that means the phone was charged for 10 hours.

Each hour of charge lasts 2 hours of use. So, if Olive is able to use her phone for 3/5 of the time she charged it last night, that means she would be able to use it for:

10 hours * (3/5) = 6 hours

So, Olive would be able to use her phone for 6 hours before it goes off.
