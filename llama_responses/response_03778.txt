Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of miles built on the first day:

50 miles are built on the first day.

Next, we know that three times this amount are built on the second day. So, three times 50 is 150 miles.

So, the total miles built on the first two days are 50 + 150 = 200 miles.

The highway's current length is 200 miles, and it needs to be extended to 650 miles. So, the total amount of miles that still need to be added is:

650 - 200 = 450

Answer: 450
