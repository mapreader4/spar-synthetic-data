Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that each class uses 200 sheets of paper per day. We are told that the school uses a total of 9000 sheets of paper every week. We are also given that there are 5 days of school days.

Let's start by identifying the variable. Let's let x be the number of classes. We know that each class uses 200 sheets of paper per day, so the total number of sheets of paper used per week is 200 x x. We are given that the total number of sheets of paper used per week is 9000. We can set up an equation to represent this:

200x = 9000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 200 to get:

x = 9000 / 200

x = 45

Answer: 45
