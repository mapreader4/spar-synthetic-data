Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of each item.

Chenny bought 9 plates at $2 each, so the total cost of the plates is 9 x 2 = 18 dollars.

Chenny also bought spoons at $1.50 each, and she paid a total of $24. So, let's subtract the cost of the plates from the total cost to find the cost of the spoons.

24 - 18 = 6

So, Chenny bought 6 spoons at $1.50 each. To find the total number of spoons, we can divide the cost of the spoons by the cost of a single spoon.

6 รท 1.5 = 4

So, Chenny bought 4 spoons.
