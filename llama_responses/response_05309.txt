Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The students have a total of 3 breaks a day. 
2. The 15-minute recesses are combined, and the 30-minute lunch and 20-minute recess are also combined. 
3. The total time spent outside of class is the sum of these two combinations.

So, the total time spent outside of class is 15 + 30 + 20 = 65 minutes. 

Answer: 65
