Let's start by using a variable, $x$, to represent the number of extra chores she does each week. She earns $1.5x each week. She earns a total of $20 + 1.5x$ per week. At the end of 10 weeks, she has $425. So, we can set up the equation: $20 + 1.5x \times 10 = 425$. We can subtract $20$ from both sides of the equation to get $1.5x \times 10 = 405$. Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by $1.5$ to get $x = 270$. So, the answer is 270.
