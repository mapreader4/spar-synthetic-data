Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of bags of apples that Austin picked. We know that Dallas picked 14 bags of apples, and Austin picked 6 bags of apples more than Dallas. So, the number of bags of apples that Austin picked is:

14 + 6 = 20

Now, let's find the number of bags of pears that Austin picked. We know that Dallas picked 9 bags of pears, and Austin picked 5 fewer bags of pears than Dallas. So, the number of bags of pears that Austin picked is:

9 - 5 = 4

To find the total number of bags of fruit that Austin picked, we add the number of bags of apples and pears together:

20 (apples) + 4 (pears) = 24

Answer: 24
