Let's break it down step by step:

Let's start by identifying the number of female cows that are pregnant.

We know that 50 percent of the cows are female, so 50% of the 44 cows are female. To find the number of female cows, we multiply 50% by 44 (the number of cows).

50% * 44 = 22

So, 22 female cows are female.

Now, we know that 50% of the female cows are pregnant. So, we multiply 50% by 22 (the number of female cows).

50% * 22 = 11

So, Terez has 11 pregnant female cows.
