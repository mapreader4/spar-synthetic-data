Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year, so in 1 year, it will produce 2 baby plants. Then, in the next year, it will also produce 2 baby plants. This will continue until 4 years. So, the total number of baby plants the mother plant will have produced after 4 years is:

2 baby plants + 2 baby plants = 4 baby plants
2 baby plants + 2 baby plants = 4 baby plants
4 baby plants + 2 baby plants = 6 baby plants
6 baby plants + 2 baby plants = 8 baby plants

So, in 4 years, the mother plant will have produced 8 baby plants.

Answer: 8
