Let's start by finding the total number of stuffed animals. Barbara has 9 stuffed animals. Trish has two times as many stuffed animals as Barbara, so Trish has 9 stuffed animals as well. So, together they have 9 + 9 = 18 stuffed animals.

Barbara will sell her stuffed animals for $2 each, so she will make 9 x 2 = 18 dollars. Trish will sell her stuffed animals for $1.50 each, so she will make 9 x 1.50 = 13.50 dollars. Together, they will make 18 + 13.5 = 31.50 dollars. They will donate this amount to their class funds.
