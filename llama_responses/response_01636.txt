Let's start by converting the hours into minutes. Keegan spends 7.5 hours in school each day. 7.5 hours is 7 * 60 = 450 minutes. He takes 1.5 hours of history and chemistry classes, which is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. So, he has 450 - 90 = 360 minutes left for his other classes. To find the average, we divide 360 by 7, which is 360 รท 7 = 51.5. So, Keegan spends 51.5 minutes in one of his other classes on average.
