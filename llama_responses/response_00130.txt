Let's break it down step by step.

Ali started with 180 seashells. He gave away 40 seashells to his friends, so he has:

180 - 40 = 140 seashells left

Then, he gave away 30 seashells to his brothers, so he has:

140 - 30 = 110 seashells left

Next, he sold half of the remaining seashells. Half of 110 is:

110 / 2 = 55

So, he sold 55 seashells. To find out how many seashells he has left, we subtract the seashells he sold from the remaining seashells:

110 - 55 = 55

Answer: 55
