Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total number of pounds of potato chips Lucy will need. There are 11 people, including Lucy, and each person will get 1.2 pounds. So, the total number of pounds of potato chips needed is 11 * 1.2 = 13.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the potato chips. The cost per pound is 25 cents. So, the total cost is 13 * 0.25 = 3.25.

So, Lucy will pay 3.25 dollars for the potato chips.
