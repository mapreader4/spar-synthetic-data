Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's find the number of oranges he has. He has 2 dozen oranges. A dozen is equal to 12, so he has 2 x 12 = 24 oranges.

Next, let's find the number of apples he has. He has 14 apples.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of oranges and the number of apples. 24 - 14 = 10.

Answer: 10
