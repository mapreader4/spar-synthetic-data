Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate the money from the cans. For every 12 cans, you receive $0.50. So, for 144 cans, you would receive:

144 cans / 12 cans per dollar = 12 dollars

So, the money from the cans is 12 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the money from the newspapers. For every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. For 20 kilograms, you would receive:

20 kilograms / 5 kilograms per dollar = 4 dollars

So, the money from the newspapers is 4 dollars.

Now, let's add the money from the cans and the money from the newspapers:

12 dollars + 4 dollars = 16 dollars

So, the total amount of money you would receive is 16 dollars.

Answer: 16
