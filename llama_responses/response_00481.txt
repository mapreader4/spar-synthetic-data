Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of people going to the show:

* Mom
* Dad
* Grandma
* 3 little sisters

There are 4 adults and 3 children. So, the total number of people going to the show is 4 + 3 = 7.

The cost of the tickets for adults is $12 each, so the total cost for the adults is 4 x 12 = $48.

The cost of the tickets for children is $10 each, so the total cost for the children is 3 x 10 = $30.

To find the total cost for the entire family, we add the cost for the adults and the cost for the children: $48 + $30 = $78.

So, the answer is: Answer: 78
