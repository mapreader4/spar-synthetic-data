Let x be the number of Russian dolls Daniel can buy at the discounted price.

The cost of the Russian dolls is 15 * 4 = 60 dollars. If the price drops to 3 dollars, the cost is 15 * 3 = 45 dollars.

Daniel can buy 45 dolls at the discounted price, as the price is less than his savings. So, the answer is 45.

Answer: 45
