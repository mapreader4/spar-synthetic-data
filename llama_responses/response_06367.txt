Let's break down the problem step by step.

Bert buys the product for $90, but he has to pay 10% of the value in tax, so we need to calculate 10% of 90.

10% of 90 is the same as 0.1 times 90, which is 9.

So, Bert has to pay 9 dollars in tax.

To find out how much Bert made on this sale, we need to subtract the tax from the total sale.

Bert's total sale is 90, and he has to pay 9 dollars in tax, so he has 90 - 9 = 81 dollars left.

Answer: 81
