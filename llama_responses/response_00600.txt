Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Let's calculate Mike's new typing speed. If he can type 65 words per minute with his right hand, then with his right hand, he can type 45 words per minute now. So, his new typing speed is 45 words per minute.

Step 2: Let's calculate the time it will take Mike to type the document. To do this, we can divide the total number of words in the document (810) by his new typing speed (45 words per minute).

Answer: 810 words / 45 words per minute = 18 minutes.
