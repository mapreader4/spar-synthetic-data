Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of students accepted to the university.

20,000 students apply, and 5% of them are accepted. To find the number of accepted students, we can multiply 20,000 by 5%:

20,000 x 0.05 = 1,000

So, 1,000 students are accepted to the university.

Step 2: Find the number of students who choose to attend Harvard University.

Of the accepted students, 90% choose to attend Harvard University. To find the number of students who choose to attend Harvard, we can multiply 1,000 by 0.9:

1,000 x 0.9 = 900

Answer: 900
