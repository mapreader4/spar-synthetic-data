Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the total distance on the first trip is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. To find the time taken for the first trip, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 1500 miles / 75 MPH
Time = 20 hours

So, the time taken for the first trip is 20 hours.

For the second trip, the total distance is 750 miles and the average speed is 25 MPH. To find the time taken for the second trip, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 750 miles / 25 MPH
Time = 30 hours

So, the time taken for the second trip is 30 hours.

Now, we want to find the fastest route. We can add the times taken for both trips:

Total Time = 20 hours + 30 hours
Total Time = 50 hours

So, the fastest route takes 50 hours.
