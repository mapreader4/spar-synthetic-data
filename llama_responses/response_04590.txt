Let's break down the information given: the farmer shipped 10 boxes of pomelos last week, and each box had 24 pomelos. So, the total number of pomelos shipped last week is 10 * 24 = 240. This week, the farmer shipped 20 boxes. So, the total number of pomelos shipped in all is 20 * 24 = 480. 

Answer: 480
