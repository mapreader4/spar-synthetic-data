Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* It rained 3 mm, 6 mm, and 5 mm on the three days while Greg was camping.
* The total amount of rain while camping is the sum of these three amounts: 3 + 6 + 5 = 14 mm.
* It rained 26 mm at his house, which is a different location.

To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping, we need to subtract the amount of rain at his house from the total amount of rain while camping: 26 mm - 14 mm = 12 mm.

Answer: 12
