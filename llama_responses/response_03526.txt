Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first determine which fruit is the cheaper one. Since 10 apples for $2 is the same as 200 cents, and 5 oranges for $1.50 is the same as 150 cents, the cheaper fruit is the oranges.

Jane would need to buy 12 of these 5 oranges. Since each orange costs 150 cents, the total cost would be 12 x 150 = 1800 cents.

Answer: 1800
