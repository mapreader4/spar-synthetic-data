Let's break this down step by step.

1. Simon bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each. 5 x 2.50 = 12.50
2. He also bought one hydrangea that cost $12.50. So, the total cost of the flowers is 12.50 + 12.50 = 24.50.
3. He also bought 5 petunias that cost $1.00 each. 5 x 1.00 = 5.00. The total cost of the flowers is now 24.50 + 5.00 = 29.50.
4. The garden center is offering 10% off all purchases. 29.50 x 0.10 = 2.95.
5. The total amount he paid is $50. 50 - 2.95 = 47.05.

So, the change Simon would receive back is 50 - 47.05 = 2.95.

Answer: 2.95
