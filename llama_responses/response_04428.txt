Let's break this down step by step.

1. Rick traveled to the first destination, and then from there, he traveled twice the distance to the second destination.

Let's call the distance to the first destination x. Then, the distance to the second destination is 2x.

2. The third point on his trip was 40 miles away, which was half the distance he traveled from the beginning to his first destination.

So, the distance from the beginning to the first destination is 2(40) = 80 miles.

3. The final destination took twice the amount of driving of all the other legs put together.

The total distance traveled so far is x + 2x + 40 = 3x + 40. The final destination is twice this distance, so it's 2(3x + 40) = 6x + 80.

The total distance traveled is the sum of all the legs: x + 2x + 40 + 6x + 80.

Combine like terms: 9x + 120.

Answer: 120
