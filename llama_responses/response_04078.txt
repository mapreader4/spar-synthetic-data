Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: There were 15 boys initially in the class.

Step 2: The number of girls was 20% greater than the number of boys. So, let's find 20% of 15. 20% of 15 is 3. So, the number of girls was 15 + 3 = 18.

Step 3: Later, the number of girls doubled. The number of girls became 2 x 18 = 36.

Step 4: The number of boys remained the same, which is 15.

Step 5: The total number of students now is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls. The total number of students is 15 + 36 = 51.

Answer: 51.
