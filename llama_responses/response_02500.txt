Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find out how much flour is needed to make 2 cakes. If 2 cakes require 2 packages of flour, and 1 package of flour is 3, then 2 packages will be 2 x 3 = 6.

So, Claire needs 6 packages of flour.

To find out how much Claire pays for the flour, we multiply the number of packages by the cost per package. 6 packages of flour cost 6 x 3 = 18.

Answer: 18
