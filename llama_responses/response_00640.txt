Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many ceilings Michelangelo painted this week. He painted 12 ceilings.

Next, we need to find out how many ceilings he will paint next week. He will paint 1/4 the number of ceilings he painted this week. So, if he painted 12 ceilings this week, he will paint 12/4 = 3 ceilings next week.

Now, let's find out how many ceilings are left to paint. We know that Michelangelo painted 28 ceilings originally, and he painted 12 of them this week. So, the number of ceilings left to paint is 28 - 12 = 16.

Answer: 16
