Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total area of the quilt, which is 16 feet by 20 feet, which is 320 square feet.

Next, we need to find the number of patches needed to cover this area. Since each patch is 4 square feet, we can divide the total area by the size of each patch to get the number of patches needed. 320 / 4 = 80 patches.

The first 10 patches cost $10 each, so the total cost of the first 10 patches is 10 x 10 = $100. The remaining 70 patches will cost half as much, which is 10 / 2 = $5. So, the cost of each of the remaining patches is $5.

To find the total cost of the remaining patches, we multiply the number of patches by the cost of each patch. 70 x 5 = 350. The total cost of all the patches is the cost of the first 10 patches plus the cost of the remaining patches. 100 + 350 = 450.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 450
