Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the area of the square-shaped street. Since the street has a length of 100 meters on one side, it has an area of 100 * 100 = 10,000 square meters.

The area of the forest is three times the area of the street, so the area of the forest is 3 * 10,000 = 30,000 square meters.

Now, the number of trees per square meter in the forest is 4. To find the total number of trees, we multiply the area of the forest by the number of trees per square meter: 30,000 * 4 = 120,000 trees.

Answer: 120,000
