Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the distance Samson will travel. The distance to the town is 140 km. But he will travel one way, so we need to divide the distance by 2. 140 km / 2 = 70 km. So the distance is 70 km.

Now, he will use 10 liters of gasoline for a distance of 70 km. So, for a one-way trip, he will use 10 liters / 70 km = 0.1428 liters.

Answer: 0.1428
