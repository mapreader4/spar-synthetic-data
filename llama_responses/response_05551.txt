To solve this problem, I will think step by step.

First, I will calculate the cost of the computer and the printer. The cost of the computer is $400, and the cost of the printer is $40. So, the total cost of the computer and the printer is $400 + $40, which is $440.

Next, I will subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Delores has, which is $450. So, I will subtract $440 from $450. To do this, I will write the subtraction problem as follows:

$450 - $440 =?

To solve this problem, I will use the subtraction symbol, which is a minus sign (-). I will subtract $440 from $450, which gives me:

$450 - $440 = $10

So, the answer is that Delores has $10 left.

Answer: 10
