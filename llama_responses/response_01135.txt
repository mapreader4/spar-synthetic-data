Let's start by calculating the total cost of the books Reggie bought.

The cost of each book is $2, so the total cost of the 5 books is 5 x 2 = 10 dollars.

Reggie's father gave him $48. So, Reggie has 48 dollars initially. After buying the 5 books, Reggie has 48 - 10 dollars left.

Answer: 38
