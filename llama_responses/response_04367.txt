Let's break down Susan's movements step by step.

1. Susan moves forward 8 spaces on the first turn.
2. She moves back 5 spaces on the second turn, so she has moved a total of 3 spaces forward (8 - 5 = 3).
3. On the third turn, she moves 6 spaces forward.

So, Susan has moved a total of 3 + 6 = 9 spaces forward. To reach the winning space, she needs to move 48 - 9 = 39 spaces.

Answer: 39
