Let's break down the information given:

Annie has 6 barrettes.
She has twice as many scrunchies as barrettes, so she has 6 * 2 = 12 scrunchies.
She has 3 fewer bobby pins than barrettes, so she has 6 - 3 = 3 bobby pins.

In total, she has 6 + 12 + 3 = 21 hair decorations.

The number of bobby pins is 3 out of 21. To find the percentage, we can divide 3 by 21 and multiply by 100:

3 / 21 = 0.14
0.14 * 100 = 14

Answer: 14
