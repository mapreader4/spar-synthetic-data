Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of people at the party, which is 15, including Carl himself.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of punch each person will have. We know that each glass holds 12 ounces of punch, and we want everyone to have at least 2 glasses. So, each person will have 2 glasses of punch, which is a total of 2 x 12 ounces per person.

To find the total amount of ounces of punch needed, we multiply the number of people by the number of ounces per person: 15 people x 2 x 12 ounces = 15 x 24 = 360 ounces.

So, Carl needs to buy 360 ounces of punch for the party.

Answer: 360
