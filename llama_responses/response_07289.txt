Let's break this down step by step.

Ursula bought 5 hot dogs at $1.50 each, so that's a total of 5 x 1.50 = 7.50. She also bought 3 salads at $2.50 each, so that's a total of 3 x 2.50 = 7.50. In total, she spent 7.50 + 7.50 = 15.00.

Ursula paid with 2 $10 bills. To find the change, we need to subtract 15.00 from 20.00 (since 2 x 10 = 20.00). So, the change is 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00.

Answer: 5.00
