Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say John watches cartoons for x minutes. We know that for every 10 minutes of cartoons, he has to do 8 minutes of chores. So, we can set up an equation:

x / 10 = 2 / 8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 10:

x = 2 * 10 / 8
x = 20 / 8
x = 2.5

So, John has to do 2.5 minutes of chores.
