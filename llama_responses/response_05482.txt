Let's break down the total amount of water Rachel drinks each day:

* Sunday: 2 glasses = 2 x 10 = 20 ounces
* Monday: 4 glasses = 4 x 10 = 40 ounces
* Tuesday to Friday: 3 glasses each day = 3 x 3 = 9 x 10 = 90 ounces
* Total amount of water drank from Tuesday to Friday = 90 ounces
* Total amount of water drank in 5 days = 20 + 40 + 90 = 150 ounces
* Total amount of water Rachel wants to drink in a week = 220 ounces
* Amount of water Rachel needs to drink on Saturday = 220 - 150 = 70 ounces

Since one glass of water is 10 ounces, Rachel needs to drink 70 รท 10 = 7 glasses of water on Saturday.
