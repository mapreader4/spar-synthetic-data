Let's break this problem down step by step.

Celine buys 2 laptops at $600 each. So the cost of laptops is 2 * $600 = $1200.

Celine buys 4 smartphones at $400 each. So the cost of smartphones is 4 * $400 = $1600.

The total cost of both laptops and smartphones is $1200 + $1600 = $2800.

Celine has $3000. So she has $3000 - $2800 = $200 left over.

Answer: 200
