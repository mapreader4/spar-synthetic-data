Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the values given in the problem:

* The new iPhone costs $800.
* She can trade in her Samsung Galaxy for $240.
* She can make $80 per week babysitting.

Now, we need to figure out how many weeks she needs to work to make enough money to buy the iPhone. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of weeks she needs to work.

The equation is:

80 * x = 800 - 240

We can solve for x by subtracting 240 from both sides of the equation:

80x = 800 - 240

80x = 560

Now, we need to find the value of x by dividing both sides of the equation by 80:

x = 560 / 80

x = 7

Answer: 7
