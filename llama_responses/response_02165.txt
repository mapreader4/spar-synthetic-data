Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Elliot has read 149 pages.

He has a total of 381 pages to read.

To find the number of pages he still has left to read, we can subtract the number of pages he has read (149) from the total number of pages (381).

381 - 149 = 232.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 232
