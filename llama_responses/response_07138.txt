To find the difference in the distance driven, we can subtract the distance driven by Gervais from the total distance driven by Henri.

Let's first find the distance driven by Gervais. Gervais drove 315 miles for 3 days. So, the distance driven by Gervais is 315 miles per day. To find the total distance driven by Gervais, we multiply 315 by 3:

315 miles per day Ã— 3 days = 945 miles

Now, we can subtract the distance driven by Gervais from the total distance driven by Henri. The difference is:

1,250 miles - 945 miles = 305 miles

Answer: 305
