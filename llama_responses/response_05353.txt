Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the puppies. There are 2 puppies, and each puppy costs $20. So, the total cost of the puppies is 2 x 20 = 40.

Next, we know that the total cost of the kittens is $100. So, the cost of the kittens is $100.

Let's find the cost of the kittens in terms of the puppies. Let's subtract the cost of the puppies from the total cost. $100 - 40 = $60.

So, the pet shop has 6 kittens.
