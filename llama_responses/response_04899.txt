Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of letters in the names of her friends. The names are Jessica, Tori, Lily, and Patrice. Let's count the letters:

1. Jessica: 7 letters
2. Tori: 5 letters
3. Lily: 4 letters
4. Patrice: 7 letters

The total number of letters is 7 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 17.

Since each bracelet costs $2, the total cost will be 17 x $2 = 34.

Answer: 34
