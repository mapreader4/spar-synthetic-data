Let's break this down step by step.

Lisa makes breakfast for her family every morning, Monday through Friday. This means she makes breakfast for 5 days a week.

She makes 2 eggs for each of her 4 children, so that is 2 * 4 = 8 eggs. Then, she makes 3 eggs for her husband. Then, she makes 2 eggs for herself.

So, in total, Lisa makes 8 + 3 + 2 = 13 eggs for her family for breakfast every week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we need to multiply this by 52 to get the total number of eggs cooked for the whole year.

52 * 13 = 676 eggs.
