Let's break it down step by step:

1. Athena bought 3 sandwiches at $3 each, so the cost of the sandwiches is 3 x 3 = 9 dollars.
2. She also bought 2 fruit drinks at $2.5 each, so the cost of the fruit drinks is 2 x 2.5 = 5 dollars.
3. The total cost of the snacks is the sum of the cost of the sandwiches and the cost of the fruit drinks. So, the total cost is 9 + 5 = 14 dollars.
