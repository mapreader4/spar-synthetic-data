Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Emani has $x amount of money and Howard has $y amount of money. We know that Emani has $30 more money than Howard, so we can write an equation to represent this:

x - y = 30

We also know that Emani has $150 in total. So we can write another equation to represent this:

x + y = 150

We can solve for y by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation x + y = 150:

x + (y - 30) = 150

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:

x + y = 120

Now we can substitute x = 120 - y = 30 into our first equation:

y = 120 - x

Now we know that Emani has $120 - y, and Howard has $y. To find out how much each person gets, we can add y to both sides:

y + y = 120 - y

This simplifies to:

2y = 120 - y

We can solve for y by dividing both sides by 2:

y = 60

So, Emani gets $60 and Howard gets $60.
