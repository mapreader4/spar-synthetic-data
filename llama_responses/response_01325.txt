Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate the money she earned last month. She earned $1000.

This month, she received a 10% raise. To find out how much she will earn this month, we multiply her previous earnings by 1.1 (1 + 0.1). This is because a 10% raise is the same as a 1.1 times her previous amount.

1000 * 1.1 = 1100

So, she will earn 1100 this month. To find the total amount for the two months, we add her earnings for both months.

1000 + 1100 = 1200

Answer: 1200
