Let's start by calculating the total number of balloons they have initially.

Brooke has 12 balloons, and Tracy has 6 balloons.

If they add the balloons together, they have 12 + 6 = 18 balloons in total.

Then, Tracy pops half of her balloons. Half of 6 balloons is 6 / 2 = 3 balloons.

So, Brooke has 12 balloons and Tracy has 15 balloons in total, and Tracy pops 3 balloons. So, they have 12 + 12 - 3 = 21 balloons in total.

Answer: 21
