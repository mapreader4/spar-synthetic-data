Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old.

The Franzia wine is 3 times as old as the Carlo Rosi. So, the Franzia wine is 40 * 3 = 120 years old.

The Twin Valley wine is 4 times older than the Carlo Rosi. So, the Twin Valley wine is 40 * 4 = 160 years old.

So, the total age of the three brands of wine is 120 + 160 = 280 years old.
