Let's break this problem down step by step.

Tara has $10 to start with. She wants to buy a clarinet that costs $90. So, the number of books she needs to sell to reach her goal is:

$90 - $10 = $80

Since she sells each book for $5, she needs to sell:

$80 / $5 = 16

Tara sells 16 books in total to reach her goal.
