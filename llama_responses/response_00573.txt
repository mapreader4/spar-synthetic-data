Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of money Bert earned from selling the phones.

Bert sold 8 phones for $18 each, so he earned 8 x 18 = 144 dollars.

Now, let's find the amount of money Tory earned from selling the guns.

Tory sold 7 guns for $20 each, so he earned 7 x 20 = 140 dollars.

Now, to find the difference between the two amounts, we need to subtract 140 from 144.

144 - 140 = 4.

So, Bert earned 4 more dollars than Tory.
