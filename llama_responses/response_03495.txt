Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many goals Louie scored in total in his first season. He scored 4 goals in the last match, and 40 goals in the previous matches. So, the total number of goals he scored in his first season is:

4 (goals in the last match) + 40 (goals in the previous matches) = 44 goals

Now, let's focus on Louie's brother. He has played for 3 seasons, and each season has 50 games. So, he has played a total of:

3 (seasons) x 50 (games per season) = 150 games

He has scored twice as many goals as Louie scored in the last match (which is 4 goals) in each game. So, he has scored:

4 (goals per game) x 2 = 8 goals per game

Since he has played 150 games, the total number of goals he has scored is:

8 (goals per game) x 150 (games) = 1200 goals

Now, let's add the total number of goals scored by both brothers:

Louie's total goals = 44 goals
Brother's total goals = 1200 goals
Total goals = 44 + 1200 = 1244 goals

Answer: 1244
