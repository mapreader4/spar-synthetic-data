Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Antoine is inviting 6 people over for dinner.
* The butcher recommends 1/2 pound of meat per person.
* The beef tenderloin is $15.00 per pound.

To find the total amount of meat needed, we need to multiply the amount per person by the number of people:

1/2 pound per person x 6 people = 3 pounds of meat

Since the beef tenderloin is $15.00 per pound, we can multiply the total amount of meat by the price per pound to find the total cost:

3 pounds of meat x $15.00 per pound = 3 x $15.00 = $45.00

So, the total cost of the beef tenderloin for Antoine's dinner party will be $45.00.
