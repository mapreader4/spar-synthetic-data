Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the time it takes for Apple to run 24 miles at a rate of 3 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 miles / 3 miles per hour
Time = 24 miles / 3 mph
Time = 8 hours

So, it will take Apple 8 hours to run 24 miles at a rate of 3 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the time it takes for Mac to run 24 miles at a rate of 4 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

So, it will take Mac 6 hours to run 24 miles at a rate of 4 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the difference in time it takes for Mac to run 24 miles at a rate of 4 miles per hour and Apple to run 24 miles at a rate of 3 miles per hour.

Time for Mac - Time for Apple
Time for Mac - 6 hours
Time for Apple - 8 hours
Time for Mac - 2 hours

Time for Mac is 2 hours less than time for Apple.
