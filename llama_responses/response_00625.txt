To find the total number of trash cans the town paid for, we need to multiply the number of trash cans added to the streets by 2. The town added 14 trash cans to the streets, so that is 14 * 2 = 28. Then, the town also added trash cans to the back of stores. Since the town added twice as many trash cans to the back of stores, we multiply 14 by 2, which is 14 * 2 = 28. So, the total number of trash cans the town paid for is 28 + 28 = 56. 

Answer: 56
