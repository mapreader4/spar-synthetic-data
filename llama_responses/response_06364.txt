Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the three items Toby sold and their respective prices:

1. Treadmill: $100
2. Chest of drawers: half as much as the treadmill, so $100 / 2 = $50
3. Television: three times as much as the treadmill, so $100 x 3 = $300

Now, we know that these three items made up 75% of the total amount of sales money Toby earned. This means that the total amount of sales money is 100% - 75% = 25% more than the sum of these three items.

Let's calculate the sum of these three items:

$100 + $50 + $300 = $450

Now, we need to find 25% of $450 to add to the sum:

25% of $450 = ($450 x 0.25) = $112.50

So, the total sum of money Toby made at the garage sale is:

$450 + $112.50 = $562.50

Answer: 562
