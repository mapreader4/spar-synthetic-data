Let's break this down step by step.

Martha spends 10 minutes turning the router off and on again. This is a fixed time, so we can add this to our total time.

Next, she spends 6 times 10 minutes on hold with Comcast, which is 60 minutes. We can add this to our total time.

Then, she spends half as much time as she spent on hold yelling at a customer service representative. She spent 60 minutes on hold, so half of that is 30 minutes. We can add this to our total time.

To find the total time, we add the 10 minutes turning the router on and off again, the 60 minutes on hold, and the 30 minutes yelling at a customer service representative.

10 + 60 + 30 = 100

Answer: 100
