Let's break it down step by step.

Cathy and Chris were supposed to work 20 hours per week each for 2 months. 2 months is 8 weeks, so Cathy was supposed to work 20 * 8 = 160 hours.

But then Chris got sick for 1 week. 1 week is 7 days. Cathy took Chris's shifts, so Cathy only worked for 3 weeks, or 3 * 20 = 60 hours.

So, Cathy worked 160 - 60 = 100 hours. Cathy worked 100 hours.

Answer: 100
