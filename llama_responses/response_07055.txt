Let's break this problem down step by step.

Cindy has 20 marbles, which is 5 more than what Lisa had. This means Lisa had 20 - 5 = 15 marbles.

Cindy gives Lisa 12 marbles, so Lisa now has 15 + 12 = 27 marbles.

The question asks how many more marbles Lisa has now, which is 27 - 15 = 12.

Answer: 12
