Let's start by letting x be the amount of money Trisha brought with her to the store.

We know that the total cost of the groceries is the sum of the cost of the meat, chicken, veggies, eggs, and dog food, which is 17 + 22 + 43 + 5 + 45 = 127.

Since Trisha had 35 dollars left after buying the groceries, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

x - 127 = 35

To solve for x, we subtract 127 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

x = 35 + 127
x = 162

So, Trisha brought 162 dollars with her to the store.
