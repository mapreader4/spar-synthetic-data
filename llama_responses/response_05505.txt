Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the initial number of caterpillars: 14 caterpillars.

Then, 4 more eggs hatch, and 4 more caterpillars join the original 14. So, the new total number of caterpillars is:

14 + 4 = 18

Next, 8 caterpillars leave the tree to cocoon themselves to be butterflies. These caterpillars are not counted among the caterpillars on the tree.

So, the number of caterpillars left on the tree is:

18 - 8 = 10

Answer: 10
