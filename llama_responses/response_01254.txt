Let's start by identifying the type of berries that Emilia needs. She needs a total of 42 cartons of berries, and she already has 2 cartons of strawberries and 7 cartons of blueberries. To find out how many more cartons she needs, we need to subtract the number of cartons she already has from the total number of cartons she needs.

Let's subtract 2 (strawberries) and 7 (blueberries) from 42.

42 - 2 - 7 = 33

Emilia needs 33 more cartons of berries.
