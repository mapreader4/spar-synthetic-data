Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many pizza rolls Jerome ate. We know that Jerome ate twice as many pizza rolls as Jackson, so we can multiply the number of pizza rolls Jackson ate by 2 to get the number of pizza rolls Jerome ate. Jackson ate 10 pizza rolls, so Jerome ate 10 x 2 = 20 pizza rolls.

Now, we need to find out how many pizza rolls Tyler ate. We know that Tyler ate 1 and a half times more pizza rolls than Jerome, so we can start by adding 1 to the number of pizza rolls Jerome ate, which is 20. Then, we add half of 1 to that, which is 0.5. So, Tyler ate 20 + 0.5 = 20.5 pizza rolls.

To find out how many more pizza rolls Tyler ate than Jackson, we subtract the number of pizza rolls Jackson ate from the number of pizza rolls Tyler ate. Jackson ate 10 pizza rolls, so we subtract 10 from 20.5 to get 10.5.
