Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of legs. Since each tripodasaurus has 3 legs, and there are a total of 20 legs, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of tripodasauruses.

Let's set up the equation as follows:

Let x be the number of tripodasauruses. Then, we know that each tripodasaurus has 3 legs, and there are a total of 20 legs. So, we can set up the equation as:

3x = 20

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 20 รท 3

x = 6.67

So, the answer is that there are 6 tripodasauruses in the flock.
