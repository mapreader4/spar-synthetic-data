Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Kathleen's middle school allowance was $8.  In her senior year, her allowance was $2 more than her middle school allowance. So, her senior year allowance is $8 + 2 = $10.  To find the percentage increase, we need to find the difference between her senior year allowance and her middle school allowance.  $10 - $8 = $2.  To find the percentage increase, we can use the formula: percentage = (difference / original value) * 100.  In this case, the difference is $2, and the original value is $8.  So, the percentage increase is: percentage = ($2 / $8) * 100 = 25%.  Therefore, Kathleen's weekly allowance increased by 25% from her middle school days to her senior year.
