To solve this problem, I will first find the total yards rushed by Malik and Josiah. Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games, so he rushed for a total of 4 x 18 = 72 yards. Josiah rushed for 22 yards in each of 4 games, so he rushed for a total of 4 x 22 = 88 yards. 

Now, to find the total yards rushed by all 3 athletes, I will add the total yards rushed by Malik and Josiah: 72 + 88 = 160 yards. 

Darnell rushed for an average of 11 yards per game, and he played in 4 games, so he rushed for a total of 11 x 4 = 44 yards. 

The total yards rushed by all three athletes is 160 + 44 = 204 yards. 

Answer: 204
