Let's break it down step by step.

1. The entrance ticket to the park is $5.
2. Each child's ticket costs $2, so 4 children's tickets would cost 4 x $2 = $8.
3. Each parent's ticket costs $4, so 2 parent's tickets would cost 2 x $4 = $8.
4. The grandmother's ticket also costs $4.
5. So, the total cost for the entrance fee to the park is $5.
6. The total cost for the 4 children's tickets is $8.
7. The total cost for the 2 parents' tickets is $8.
8. The total cost for the grandmother's ticket is $4.
9. The total cost for visiting the park is the sum of these costs: $5 + $8 + $8 + $4 = $17.
