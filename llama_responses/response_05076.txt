Let's break down the problem step by step.

The price of the TV increased by 2/5 times its initial price, which means the new price of the TV is 2/5 * 500 = 200, and then add it to the original price, so the new price of the TV is 500 + 200 = 700.

The price of the phone increased by 40% from its original price, which means the new price of the phone is 1.4 * 400 = 560.

To find the total amount Bethany received for the items at the auction, we need to add the prices of the TV and the phone, which is 700 + 560 = 1260.

Answer: 1260
