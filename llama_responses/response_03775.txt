Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the given information:

* Greg's PPO algorithm obtained 90% of the possible reward on the CoinRun environment.
* The maximum reward in CoinRun is half as much as the maximum ProcGen reward of 240.

From the first statement, we know that the maximum reward in CoinRun is half of 240, which is 120.

From the second statement, we know that Greg's PPO algorithm obtained 90% of the possible reward. Since the maximum reward in CoinRun is 120, we can set up an equation to represent the reward Greg's PPO algorithm obtained:

Let x be the reward Greg's PPO algorithm obtained.

We know that 90% of the possible reward is equal to the reward Greg's PPO algorithm obtained. So, we can set up the equation as:

0.9x = x

We can now solve for x, the reward Greg's PPO algorithm obtained:

x = 0.9x = 0.9x

Since we know that the maximum reward in CoinRun is 120, we can substitute x with 120:

0.9x = 0.9(120)

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.9:

x = 120 / 0.9
x = 120 / 0.9
x = 133.33

So, the answer is:

Answer: 133
