Let's break down the information given:

* In January, James made $4000.
* In March, he made twice as much as he made in January, so he made $8000.
* In February, he made $2000 less than in January, so he made $2000.

Let's add up the amounts he made in January, March, and February to find the total amount he has made this year:

$4000 + $8000 + $2000 = $12000

Answer: 12000
