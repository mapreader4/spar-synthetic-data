Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the ingredients. 12 dollars for ingredients for 2 cakes will be 12 / 2 = 6 dollars per cake.

Next, the packaging for each cake costs 1 dollar. So the total packaging cost for 2 cakes is 1 x 2 = 2 dollars. 

So the total cost for the ingredients and packaging is 6 + 2 = 8 dollars.

Andy sells each cake for 15 dollars. So to find the profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price. 15 - 8 = 7.

So Andy makes a profit of 7 dollars for each cake.
