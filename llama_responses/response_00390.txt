Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the marathon is x weeks away.

Oscar has already run 2 miles, so he has 18 miles left to go.

He wants to add 2/3 of a mile each week. So, he will add 2/3 of a mile each week to his current progress.

So, to find out how many weeks it will take him to reach the marathon, we can set up an equation.

Let x be the number of weeks.

2 miles remaining / 2/3 of a mile each week = x weeks

18 miles / (2/3 * 1) = x

18 / 2/3 = 9

So, Oscar should start training 9 weeks before the marathon.
