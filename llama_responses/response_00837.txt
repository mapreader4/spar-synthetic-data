Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the number of dogs Mariel is walking.  Since each dog walker has 3 dogs, there are 3 x 1 = 3 dogs.  So, there are 3 dogs in total.

However, Mariel is tangled up in the leashes of another dog walker and their 3 dogs.  This means we need to add the dogs of the other dog walker to the 3 dogs that Mariel is already walking.  So, there are 3 + 3 = 6 dogs in total.

But we need to count the legs of all the dogs.  Each dog has 4 legs, so the total number of legs is 4 x 6 = 24.  Since Mariel is walking 36 legs, and each leg is part of a dog, we can divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the number of dogs.  36 / 4 = 9.  So, Mariel is walking 9 dogs.
