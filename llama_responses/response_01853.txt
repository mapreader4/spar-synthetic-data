Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Shenny is going on a 7-day trip, and she wants to use the same shirt on Monday and Sunday. That means she'll need 2 shirts for those 2 days.

For the other 5 days, she'll need to bring 2 different shirts each day. So, that's 2 x 5 = 10 shirts.

So, Shenny should pack 12 shirts for her next vacation.
