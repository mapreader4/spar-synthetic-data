Let's break it down step by step.

James buys 3 dirt bikes for $150 each, so the total cost of the dirt bikes is 3 x $150 = $450.

James buys 4 off-road vehicles for $300 each, so the total cost of the off-road vehicles is 4 x $300 = $1200.

The total cost of the dirt bikes and off-road vehicles is $450 + $1200 = $1650.

It also costs $25 to register each of these, so the total registration cost is 3 x $25 = $75.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the dirt bikes, off-road vehicles, and registration. So, the total cost is $1650 + $75 = $1725.

Answer: 1725
