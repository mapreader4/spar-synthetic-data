Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The soda costs $1. Each soup costs as much as the 3 combined sodas, so the soup costs 3 x 1 = $3.
2. The sandwich costs 3 times as much as the soup, so the sandwich costs 3 x 3 = $9.
3. The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the soda, soups, and sandwich. The cost of the soda is 3 x 1 = $3, the cost of the soups is 2 x 3 = $6, and the cost of the sandwich is $9. The total cost is $3 + $6 + $9 = $18.
