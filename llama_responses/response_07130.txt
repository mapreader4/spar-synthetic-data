Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say there were x people lifting weights at the start of Bethany's shift.

After 5 people came in, the number of people lifting weights is x + 5.

Then, 2 people left, so the number of people lifting weights is x - 2.

The total number of people lifting weights is the same as the total number of people in the gym, which is 19.

So, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 - 2 = 19

We can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get:

x + 3 = 19

Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 16

So, the answer is:

Answer: 16
