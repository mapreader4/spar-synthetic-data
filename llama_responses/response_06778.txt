Let's break this down step by step.

1. The first day, Joey takes 1 pill.
2. The second day, Joey takes 1 + 1 = 2 pills.
3. The third day, Joey takes 1 + 2 = 3 pills.
4. The fourth day, Joey takes 1 + 3 = 4 pills.
5. The fifth day, Joey takes 1 + 4 = 5 pills.
6. The sixth day, Joey takes 1 + 5 = 6 pills.
7. The seventh day, Joey takes 1 + 6 = 7 pills.

So, Joey will take 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28 pills.
