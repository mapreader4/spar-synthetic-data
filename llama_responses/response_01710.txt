To find the average temperature, I will first add up all the temperatures and then divide by the number of years.

The temperatures are: 90, 90, 90, 79, and 71.

I will add them up:

90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 420

There are 5 years. To find the average, I will divide the sum by 5:

420 รท 5 = 84

Answer: 84
