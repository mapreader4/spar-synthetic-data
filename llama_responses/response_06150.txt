Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: We know the tree grows at the rate of 50 cm every 2 weeks.

Step 2: We know that the tree is currently 2 meters tall. We need to convert this to centimeters, so 2 meters is 200 cm.

Step 3: We want to know the height of the tree in 4 months. Since the tree grows at the rate of 50 cm every 2 weeks, we can find the total growth in 4 months by multiplying the growth rate by the number of weeks in 4 months.

Step 4: We need to convert 4 months to weeks. There are 4 months = 16 weeks. So, the total growth in 4 months is 16 * 50 = 800 cm.

Answer: 800
