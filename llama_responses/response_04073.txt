Let's break this problem down step by step.

The first tree is 40% red and 60% green. This means that for every 100 apples, 40 apples are red and 60 apples are green. The second tree is 50% red and 50% green. This means that for every 100 apples, 50 apples are red and 50 apples are green.

If the trees each produce 20 apples, then the total number of apples is 20. For the first tree, 40% of these apples are red. So, the number of red apples from the first tree is 8. For the second tree, 50% of these apples are red. So, the number of red apples from the second tree is 10. Therefore, the total number of red apples is 18.

Answer: 18
