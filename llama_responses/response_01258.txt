Let's break this down step by step:

1. There are 15 books with 30 puzzles each, so there are 15 * 30 = 450 puzzles in total.
2. The average time it takes to find Waldo in a puzzle is 3 minutes. To find Waldo in all 450 puzzles, it would take 450 * 3 = 1350 minutes.
3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert minutes to hours, we can divide 1350 minutes by 60 to get 22.5 hours.
4. So, it would take approximately 22.5 hours to find every Waldo.

Answer: 22.5
