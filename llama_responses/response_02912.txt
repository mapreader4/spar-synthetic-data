Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of books in each level of the pyramid. Since the top level has 64 books, we know that the fourth level has 64 books.

Since the number of books in each level is 80% of the number of books in the previous level, we can calculate the number of books in the third level by multiplying 64 by 0.8 (or 80% as a decimal):

64 x 0.8 = 51.2

So, the third level has 51.2 books.

Since the number of books in each level is 80% of the number of books in the previous level, we can calculate the number of books in the second level by multiplying 51.2 by 0.8 (or 80% as a decimal):

51.2 x 0.8 = 40.96

So, the second level has 40.96 books.

Finally, the number of books in the first level is 40.96 x 0.8 (or 80% as a decimal):

40.96 x 0.8 = 32.768

So, the first level has 32.768 books.

To find the total number of books in the pyramid, we add the number of books in each level:

64 + 51.2 + 40.96 + 32.768 = 148.968

Rounding the answer to the nearest whole number, we get:

Answer: 149
