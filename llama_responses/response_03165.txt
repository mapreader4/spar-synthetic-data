Let's start by using the information that Talia's mom is three times as old as Talia is today. Let's say Talia is x years old today. Then, Talia's mom is 3x years old.

In 7 years, Talia will be 20 years old. So, 7 years later, Talia will be 20 years old, which means that 7 years from now, Talia is 13 years old.

Since Talia's mom is 3x years old, we can set up the equation 3x = 13. Solving for x, we get x = 4.33. So, Talia's mom is 12 years old.

Now, Talia's dad is the same age as Talia's mom is today. So, Talia's dad is also 12 years old.

Answer: 12
