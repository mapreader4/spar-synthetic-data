Let's think step by step.

James has 28 marbles initially. He puts them into 4 bags. So, we can divide 28 by 4 to find out how many marbles are in each bag: 28 รท 4 = 7.

James gives one bag away. So, he has one less bag left. The number of marbles in that bag is 7. So, he has 7 marbles left.

Answer: 7
