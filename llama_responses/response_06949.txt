Let's start by identifying the total number of calories in the potato chips. We know that there are 60 calories in total in the potato chips, and each of the 6 cheezits has 1/3 more calories than a chip. 

Let's figure out the total number of calories in a chip. Since 60 / 3 = 20, each cheezit has 20 calories. So, the 6 cheezits have a total of 6 x 20 = 120 calories. 

Now, let's add the calories from the potato chips and the cheezits. The total number of calories is 60 + 120 = 180. 

Answer: 180
