Let's break this down step by step:

1. The first quarter has 265 points.
2. There are 4 times as many test points as quiz points.
3. So, the number of test points is 4x, where x is the number of quiz points.
4. There are 5 more quiz points than homework points.
5. So, the number of homework points is x + 5.
6. We can set up an equation: 4x = x + 5 - 4.
7. We can solve for x: x = 265 - 4 = 261.
8. So, the number of homework points is 261.

Answer: 261
