Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Miriam currently has 30 marbles. Let's call the number of marbles Miriam started with x.

Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has x - 60 marbles.

She then gave her sister twice that amount, so she gave her sister 2 x 60 = 120 marbles. So, she now has x - 60 - 120 marbles.

She gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, which is 3 x 30 = 90 marbles. So, she now has x - 60 - 120 - 90 marbles.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - 60 - 120 - 90 = 30.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 210 = 30.

Adding 210 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 240.

Answer: 240
