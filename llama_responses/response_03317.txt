Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the percentage of the school year that Hazel has missed.

The school year is 180 days.  Hazel has missed 6 days.  We can find the percentage of the school year that Hazel has missed by dividing the number of days she has missed (6) by the total number of days in a school year (180).

6 / 180 = 0.0333 (or 3.33%)

So, Hazel has missed 3.33% of the school year.

Since Hazel can skip her final exams if she misses 5% or less of the school year, we can set up an equation to represent the number of days Hazel can miss and still not have to take her exams.

Let's represent the number of days Hazel can miss by the total number of days in a school year, and subtract the percentage of the school year she has missed.

180 - (3.33%) =?

180 - 5 = 176.5

So, Hazel can miss 176.5 days and still not have to take her exams.
