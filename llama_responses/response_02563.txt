Let's start by identifying the number of black cows. We know that 5 more than half the cows are black. So, let's first find half of the total number of cows. Half of 18 is 9. Since 5 more than that is 14, we know that 14 cows are black. To find the number of cows that are not black, we subtract 14 from the total number of cows. 18 - 14 = 4. So, the number of cows that are not black is 4.
