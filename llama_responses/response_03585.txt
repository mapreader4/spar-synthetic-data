Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many meals Colt and Curt have given away initially.

Colt and Curt prepared 113 meals to be given away. They have given away 85 meals. So, they have given away 85 meals so far.

To find out how many meals are left, we need to subtract the meals they have given away from the total meals they had prepared.

113 - 85 = 28

So, there are 28 meals left to be distributed.

Answer: 28
