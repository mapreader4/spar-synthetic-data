Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of zits in Ms. Swanson's class. Since there are 25 kids in her class, and each kid has an average of 5 zits, we multiply the number of kids by the number of zits each kid has: 25 x 5 = 125 zits.

Next, we need to find the total number of zits in Mr. Jones' class. Since there are 32 kids in his class, and each kid has an average of 6 zits, we multiply the number of kids by the number of zits each kid has: 32 x 6 = 192 zits.

To find the difference in the number of zits, we subtract the number of zits in Ms. Swanson's class from the number of zits in Mr. Jones' class: 192 - 125 = 67.

Answer: 67
