Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the total cost of what Andy bought.

Andy bought a can of soda at $1 and two hamburgers at $2 each. So, the total cost for Andy's items is $1 + 2 * 2 = $5.

Step 2: Now, let's find the total cost of what Bob bought.

Bob ordered two sandwiches for $3 and a can of fruit drink. So, the total cost for Bob's items is $3 +? (the cost of the fruit drink).

Step 3: To find the cost of the fruit drink, we need to subtract the cost of the sandwiches from the total cost of what Bob bought.

Total cost of what Bob bought = $3 (cost of sandwiches) + cost of fruit drink
Total cost of what Bob bought = $3 + cost of fruit drink

Step 4: We know that the total cost of what Andy bought is $5. So, the cost of the fruit drink must be $5 - $3 = $2.
