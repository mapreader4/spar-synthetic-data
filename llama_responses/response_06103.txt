Let's break this down step by step.

1. Tim starts with 22 cans of soda.
2. Jeff takes 6 cans of soda from Tim, so now Tim has 22 - 6 = 16 cans left.
3. Tim buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left, so he buys 16 / 2 = 8 more cans.
4. Tim has 16 + 8 = 24 cans in the end.

Answer: 24
