Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the amount of battery used by Brody's calculator.

Brody has used three quarters of the battery, which means that he has used 3/4 of the total battery.

Step 2: Find the total battery capacity.

The total battery capacity is 60 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining battery capacity.

To find the remaining battery capacity, we subtract the used battery capacity from the total battery capacity.

Used battery capacity = 3/4 * 60 = 45 hours
Total battery capacity - used battery capacity = 60 - 45 = 15 hours
