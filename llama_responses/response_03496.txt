Let's break this down step by step.

There are 30 rows of tomatoes with 10 plants in each row. So, there are 30 x 10 = 300 plants in total.

Each plant yields 20 pieces of tomatoes. So, for each plant, the farmer can get 20 pieces of tomatoes. Since there are 300 plants, the total number of pieces of tomatoes is 300 x 20 = 6000.

Answer: 6000
