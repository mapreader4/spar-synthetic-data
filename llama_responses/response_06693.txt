Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. John's hair grows 1.5 inches every month, and he cuts it down to 6 inches when it reaches 9 inches. So, his hair will grow 3 inches before it gets cut. 12 months in a year is 12 * 1.5 = 18 inches. 18 inches is 6 inches more than 12 inches. So, he gets a haircut 12 times in a year. A haircut costs $45 and he gives a 20% tip. So, we can multiply the cost of the haircut by 12 to get the total cost of the haircuts for the year. 12 * 45 = 540. 540 * 0.2 = 108. So, the total cost of the haircuts is 540 + 108 = 648. The answer is: Answer: 648.
