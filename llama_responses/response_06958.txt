We can start by letting $x$ be the number of tickets that Alan handed out. We know that Marcy handed out 6 fewer than 5 times as many tickets as Alan, so Marcy handed out $5x-6$ tickets. We know that the total number of tickets that they handed out was 150, so we can set up an equation to solve for $x$: $$x + (5x-6) = 150$$ We can add 6 to both sides of the equation to get $$x+5x-6+6=150+6$$ We can then subtract 6 from both sides to get $$x+5x=156$$ We can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get $$x=x+156$$ Finally, we can subtract 156 from both sides to get $$x=\boxed{156-156=100}$$ Answer: 100
