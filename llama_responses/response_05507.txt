Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the information given: John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  This means he wants to be 20% less than 1000 pounds.  20% of 1000 is 20/100 * 1000 = 200 pounds.  So, he wants to be 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds or less.

Now, we need to find out how much weight he can put on the bar.  Since he wants to be 800 pounds or less, he can put 800 pounds on the bar.

Answer: 800
