Let's break down the information given:

Pete saves his money, so he didn't spend any. He has 2.50 dollars, which is 250 cents. 

Raymond spends his money at the arcade games, but still has 7 dimes left, which is 70 cents.

To find the total amount spent by Pete and Raymond, we need to add their amounts together. Pete spent 0 cents, and Raymond spent 70 cents. So, the total amount spent is:

0 + 70 = 70

Answer: 70
