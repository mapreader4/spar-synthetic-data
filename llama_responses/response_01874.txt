Let's start by subtracting the number of boxes of cookies Sonny gave away from the total number of boxes he received.

Sonny received 45 boxes of cookies initially. He gave 12 to his brother, 9 to his sister, and 7 to his cousin. So, let's subtract the number of boxes he gave away from the total:

45 - 12 = 33
33 - 9 = 24
24 - 7 = 17

So, 17 boxes of cookies were left for Sonny.
