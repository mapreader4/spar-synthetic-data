Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Quinn decided he could read 2 books a week for 10 weeks, so the total number of books Quinn can read is 2 x 10 = 20 books.

2. For every 5 books Quinn reads, he gets a coupon for a free donut. So, Quinn can get a coupon for a free donut for every 5 books, so he can get 20 / 5 = 4 free donuts.
