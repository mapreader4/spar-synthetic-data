Let's start by calculating the total number of croissants, cakes, and pizzas eaten by Jorge and Giuliana.

Jorge eats 7 croissants for breakfast and 30 pizzas before bedtime, so he eats 7 + 30 = 37 in total. Giuliana eats 18 cakes after school, so she eats 18 cakes. Therefore, the total number of croissants, cakes, and pizzas eaten by Jorge is 37 + 18 = 55.

So, the total number of croissants, cakes, and pizzas eaten by Jorge and Giuliana is 37 + 18 = 55.
