Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find the price of one CD by "The Dark". Since the "AVN" CD is half the price of one CD by "The Dark", and the "AVN" CD costs $12, we can set up an equation:

Price of "The Dark" CD = 2 x $12

Price of "The Dark" CD = $24

So, one CD by "The Dark" costs $24.

Alan is buying 2 CDs by "The Dark", so the total cost of those CDs is:

2 x $24 = $48

The "AVN" CD costs $12, so the total cost of all the CDs by "The Dark" and "AVN" is:

$48 + $12 = $60

The 5 CDs of 90s music cost 40% of the total cost of all other CDs. To find the total cost of all other CDs, we subtract the cost of the 5 CDs of 90s music from the total cost:

$60 - (5 x?) = 0.6 x $60

We can solve for the cost of one CD of 90s music:

5 x? = 0.6 x $60
? = $6

So, each CD of 90s music costs $6. The total cost of the 5 CDs of 90s music is:

5 x $6 = $30

The total cost of all the CDs is the sum of the costs of all the CDs:

$60 + $30 = $90

Answer: 90
