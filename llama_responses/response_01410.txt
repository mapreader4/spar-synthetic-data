Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first figure out how many onions Brittney can chop in 5 minutes.

Brittney can chop 15 onions in 5 minutes, so she can chop 15 / 5 = 3 onions per minute.

Now, we need to figure out how many onions Carl can chop in 30 minutes.

Carl can chop 20 onions in the same 5 minutes, so he can chop 20 / 5 = 4 onions per minute.

Now, we want to find out how many more onions Carl can chop in 30 minutes than Brittney.

Carl chops 4 onions per minute, so in 30 minutes, he can chop 4 * 30 = 120 onions.

Brittney chops 3 onions per minute, so in 30 minutes, she can chop 3 * 30 = 90 onions.

To find the difference between the two, we subtract 120 (Carl's onions) - 90 (Brittney's onions).

120 - 90 = 30.

Answer: 30
