Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the cost of one burger:

A burger costs $9.

Now, to find the cost of one pizza, we need to know that a pizza is 2 times as much as a burger. So, the cost of one pizza would be:

$9 * 2 = $18

Now, we need to find the cost of three burgers, which is 3 times the cost of one burger, which is:

$9 * 3 = $27

Finally, to find the cost of one pizza and three burgers, we add the cost of one pizza to the cost of three burgers:

$18 + $27 = $45

So, the answer is:

Answer: 45
