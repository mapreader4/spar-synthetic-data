Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the number of Monster Club cards. Oliver has twice as many Monster Club cards as Alien Baseball cards. So, let's call the number of Monster Club cards x. We can represent the number of Alien Baseball cards as 2x, since it is twice as many.

The number of Monster Club cards is 48, which is three times the size of the Alien Baseball card collection. So, we can write the number of Alien Baseball cards as 3x. Since the number of Monster Club cards is 48, we can write 48 as 3x.

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that 48 = 3x, so we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x. 48 / 3 = 16.

So, Oliver has 16 Alien Baseball cards. To find the number of Monster Club cards, we multiply the number of Alien Baseball cards by 2. 16 * 2 = 32.

Answer: 32
