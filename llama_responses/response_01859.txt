Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Janet reads 80 pages a day.
* Belinda reads 30 pages a day.
* We want to find out how many pages Janet reads in 6 weeks.

To find the number of pages Janet reads in 6 weeks, we can multiply the number of pages Janet reads in a day by the number of days in 6 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 * 6 = 42 days in 6 weeks.

Now, let's multiply the number of pages Janet reads in a day by the number of days in 6 weeks:

80 pages per day * 42 days = 80 * 42 = 3360

So, Janet reads 3360 pages in 6 weeks.

Answer: 3360
