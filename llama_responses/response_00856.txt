Let's break it down step by step.

Randy makes 4 trips to the store every month. There are 12 months in a year. So, Randy makes 4 * 12 = 48 trips to the store in a year.

Randy spends 2 dollars every time he goes to the store. So, the amount he spends is 2 * 48 = 96 dollars.

He has 104 dollars left in his piggy bank after a year. So, he had 104 + 96 = 200 dollars at first. 

Answer: 200
