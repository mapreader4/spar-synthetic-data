Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Antonio's current age is x. Since Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, we know that Isabella's age is 2x.

Since Isabella will be 10 years old in 18 months, we know that 2x = 10. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

2x = 10
x = 10/2
x = 5

So, Antonio is 5 years old.
