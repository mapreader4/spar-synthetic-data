Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total time it takes for 30 cars to come down the road.

The time it takes for 1 car to come down the road is 20 minutes. To find the total time it takes for 30 cars, we can multiply the time it takes for 1 car by 30.

20 minutes * 30 = 600 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

600 minutes รท 60 = 10 hours

So, it takes 10 hours for 30 cars to come down the road.

Answer: 10
