Let's break it down step by step.

First, Sophie buys five cupcakes at $2 each, so she spends 5 * 2 = $10 on cupcakes.

Next, she buys six doughnuts at $1 each, so she spends 6 * 1 = $6 on doughnuts.

Then, she buys four slices of apple pie at $2 per slice, so she spends 4 * 2 = $8 on apple pie.

Finally, she buys fifteen cookies at $0.60 each, so she spends 15 * 0.60 = $9 on cookies.

Adding up all of these, Sophie spends 10 + 6 + 8 + 9 = $25.
