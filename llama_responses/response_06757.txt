Let's break down the damages into parts:

1. Loss of a $50,000 annual salary for 30 years: $50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000
2. Medical bills of $200,000

The total damages he's asking for is $1,500,000 + $200,000 = $1,700,000

If he gets 80% of this, he gets 0.8 x $1,700,000 = $1,360,000

So, the answer is:

Answer: 1,360,000
