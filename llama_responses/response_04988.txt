Let's break down the information step by step.

Greg lent Tessa $40 initially. Then, Tessa paid back half of her debt, which is half of $40, which is $20. Then, Tessa asked for $10 more. So, the amount Tessa owes Greg is the original debt minus the amount she paid, which is $40 - $20 = $20. Then, she asked for $10 more, so the new amount she owes Greg is $20 + $10 = $30.

Answer: 30
