Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the seminar fee for the 10 teachers. The regular seminar fee is $150, so the total cost would be:

10 x $150 = $1500

Then, we need to apply the 5% discount. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage:

$1500 x 0.05 = $75

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

$1500 - $75 = $1425

Next, we need to add the $10 food allowance for each of the 10 teachers. So, we multiply the number of teachers by the food allowance:

10 x $10 = $100

Finally, we add the total cost of the seminar fee and the food allowance:

$1425 + $100 = $1525

Answer: 1525
