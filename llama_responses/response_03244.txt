Let's break down the problem step by step.

The radio show plays for 3 hours a day, which is equivalent to 180 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

The show includes 3 talking segments, each lasting 10 minutes. So, the total time spent on talking segments is:

3 talking segments × 10 minutes per segment = 30 minutes

The show also includes 5 ad breaks, each lasting 5 minutes. So, the total time spent on ad breaks is:

5 ad breaks × 5 minutes per break = 25 minutes

Now, let's subtract the time spent on talking segments and ad breaks from the total show time:

180 minutes (total show time) - 30 minutes (talking segments) - 25 minutes (ad breaks) = 125 minutes

This means the show plays songs for 125 minutes.

Answer: 125
