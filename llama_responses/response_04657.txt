Let's break this down step by step.

1. Fatima has a piece of cloth that is 100 square inches big.
2. She decides to cut the cloth in half. This means that she will have 50 square inches left over after cutting.
3. She plans to keep half and donate the other half. So, she will keep 50 square inches and donate 50 square inches.
4. She plans on doing this 2 times. This means that she will keep 50 square inches and donate 50 square inches.
5. So, in total, she will donate 50 + 50 = 100 square inches.
