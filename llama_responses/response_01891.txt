Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's say the number of stickers that Xia had at the beginning is x.

Since Xia had 5 sheets of stickers left after sharing with her friends, each sheet had 10 stickers. So, the total number of stickers that Xia had at the beginning is 5 * 10 = 50.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 50
