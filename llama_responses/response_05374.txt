Let's start by identifying the total number of marbles. We know that half of the marbles are blue, so that is 1/2 of the total. A quarter of the marbles are red, which is 1/4 of the total. 27 marbles are green, and 14 are yellow. We can add these together to get the total number of marbles: 1/2 + 1/4 + 27 + 14 = 1/2 + 31/4 + 14. We can simplify this fraction to 63/2 + 14, which is 77/2, or 38.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a marble, we can round down to the nearest whole number, which is 38. So, there are 38 marbles in the jar.
