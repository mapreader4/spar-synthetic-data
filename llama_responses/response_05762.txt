Let's break this down step by step.

1. The nurse must check 26 Kindergarteners. This will take 2 minutes per child, so 2 x 26 = 52 minutes.

2. The nurse must check 19 first graders. This will take 2 minutes per child, so 2 x 19 = 38 minutes.

3. The nurse must check 20 second graders. This will take 2 minutes per child, so 2 x 20 = 40 minutes.

4. The nurse must check 25 third graders. This will take 2 minutes per child, so 2 x 25 = 50 minutes.

5. To find the total time, we add the time for each group. 52 + 38 + 40 + 50 = 140 minutes.

Answer: 140
