Let's start by finding the total number of marbles Markus has. Markus has 2 bags with 13 marbles in each bag, so he has a total of 2 x 13 = 26 marbles. Since Mara has 12 bags with 2 marbles in each bag, she has a total of 12 x 2 = 24 marbles. To find out how many more marbles Markus has, we subtract the number of marbles Mara has from the number of marbles Markus has: 26 - 24 = 2. Answer: 2
