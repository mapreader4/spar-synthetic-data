Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of fish James has after 20% of the fish have gone bad. To find the total number of fish that are left, we can multiply the total number of fish by the decimal value of 0.2 (20%).

400 x 0.2 = 80

So, James has 400 - 80 = 320 fish left.

Now, James needs 40 fish to make one sushi roll. To find the number of sushi rolls James can make, we can divide the number of fish left by 40.

320 รท 40 = 8

So, James can make 8 sushi rolls with the remaining fish.
