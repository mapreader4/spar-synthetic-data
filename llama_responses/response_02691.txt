Let's start by letting Kyle's catch be represented by the variable k. Then, we know that Kyle and Tasha caught the same number of fish, so we can let Tasha's catch be represented by the variable t. We can set up an equation with the information given to us.

The equation would be:

k + t = 36

We know that Carla caught 8 fish, so we can substitute that in for k to get:

k + t = 36 = 8

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get:

k = 28

So, Kyle caught 28 fish.
