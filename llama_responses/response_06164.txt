Let's break it down step by step.

Adam bought 3 sandwiches for $3 each. So the cost of the sandwiches is 3 x 3 = 9.

He also bought a bottle of water for $2.

To find the total cost of the shopping, we add the cost of the sandwiches and the cost of the water.

9 + 2 = 11.

So, the total cost of the shopping is 11.

Answer: 11
