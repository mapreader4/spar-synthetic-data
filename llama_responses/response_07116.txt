Let's start by identifying the number of eggs in each box. There are 12 eggs in total, and since she packs an equal number in each box, we can divide 12 by 4 to find the number of eggs in each box. 12 / 4 = 3.

Each box has 3 eggs, and since each egg weighs 10 ounces, the weight of the eggs in each box is 3 x 10 = 30 ounces.

There are 3 boxes remaining. The total weight of the chocolate eggs is the total weight of the eggs in each box, which is 3 x 30 = 90 ounces. So, the answer is:

Answer: 90
