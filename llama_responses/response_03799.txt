Let's start by letting x be Mary's current age. Since Suzy will be twice Mary's age in four years, we know that Suzy's age in four years will be 2x. So, we can set up an equation: 20 + 4 = 2x. We can subtract 4 from both sides to get: 16 = 2x. We can divide both sides by 2 to get: 8 = x. So, Mary is 8 years old.
