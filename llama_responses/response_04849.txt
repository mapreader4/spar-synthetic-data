Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the poodles.  It takes 30 minutes to groom a poodle.  There are 3 poodles, so it will take 3 x 30 = 90 minutes to groom all the poodles.

Next, let's look at the terriers.  It takes half as much time to groom a terrier as it takes to groom a poodle.  Since it takes 30 minutes to groom a poodle, it takes 15 minutes to groom a terrier.  There are 8 terriers, so it will take 8 x 15 = 120 minutes to groom all the terriers.

Now, let's add the time it takes to groom the poodles and the time it takes to groom the terriers.  It will take 90 + 120 = 210 minutes in total.
