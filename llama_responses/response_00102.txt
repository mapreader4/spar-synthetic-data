Let's think step by step.

Ellie needs 10ml of oil for each wheel, and the bike has 4 wheels. So, she needs 10 x 4 = 40ml of oil for the wheels.

She also needs 5ml of oil for the rest of the bike. So, she needs 5ml of oil for the rest.

In total, Ellie needs 40ml + 5ml of oil = 45ml to fix the bike.

Answer: 45
