Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the items Linda bought. She bought two coloring books at $4 each, so that's a total of $8. She also bought 4 packs of peanuts at $1.50 each, so that's a total of $6. And she also bought one stuffed animal, the price of which we want to find.

The total cost of the items Linda bought is $8 + $6, which is $14. She gave the cashier $25. So, to find the cost of the stuffed animal, we subtract $25 - $14 from $25, which gives us $11.
