Let's start by using the information that Max sold 24 candy bars. Since Seth sold 6 more candy bars than 3 times the number of candy bars that Max sold, we can say that Seth sold 3 times the number of candy bars that Max sold, plus 6 candy bars.

Let's call the number of candy bars that Max sold "x". Then, we can say that Seth sold 3x + 6 candy bars.

We know that Max sold 24 candy bars, so we can set up an equation to solve for x:

3x + 6 = 24

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 24 - 6
3x = 18

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 18 / 3
x = 6

So, Seth sold 6 candy bars.
