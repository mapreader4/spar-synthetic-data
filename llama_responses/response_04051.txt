Let's start by adding up the total cost of all the items:

* The platter of Taco Salad cost $10.
* 5 orders of Dave's Single hamburger cost 5 x $5 = $25.
* 4 sets of french fries cost 4 x $2.50 = $10.
* 5 cups of peach lemonade cost 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost is $10 + $25 + $10 + $10 = $45.

Since there are 5 friends, we need to divide the total cost by 5 to find the amount each friend will pay:

$45 รท 5 = $9.
