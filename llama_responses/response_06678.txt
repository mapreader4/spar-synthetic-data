Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of lemons: 16 orchards are for lemons, which is the most popular citrus fruit. Then, we know that oranges will occupy half as many orchards as lemons, so the number of orchards for oranges will be half of 16, which is 8. 

Now, we know that limes and grapefruits will split the remaining orchards. The remaining orchards will be divided equally between limes and grapefruits. We can find the number of orchards for grapefruits by subtracting the number of orchards for lemons and oranges from the total number of orchards. 

The total number of orchards is 16. The number of orchards for lemons is 8 and the number of orchards for oranges is 8. So, the number of orchards remaining is 16 - 8 - 8 = 0. Since limes and grapefruits split the remaining orchards, the number of orchards for grapefruits is half of 0, which is 0.

Answer: 0
