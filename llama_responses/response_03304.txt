Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the total number of fruits in the basket. Since there are as many apples as oranges, the total number of fruits is 2 times the number of apples. The number of apples is given as 15, so the total number of fruits is 2 x 15 = 30.

Step 2: We know that Emiliano eats 2/3 of each fruit's quantity. To find the number of fruits Emiliano consumes, we need to find 2/3 of 30. To do this, we can multiply 2 by 30 and then divide the result by 3.

2 * 30 = 60 รท 3 = 20

So, the answer is: Answer: 20
