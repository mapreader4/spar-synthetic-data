Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Jeremy buys 3 bags of chips. We know that Stacy buys 4 bags. We also know that they need 10 bags of chips in total. 

We can set up an equation to represent this information. Let's say x be the number of bags Emily buys. Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

3 + x = 10

We know that Jeremy buys 3 bags, so we can substitute that into the equation:

3 + x = 10

We can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 7

So, Emily should buy 7 bags of chips.
