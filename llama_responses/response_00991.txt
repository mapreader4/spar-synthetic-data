Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. There are 6 unicorns, and each unicorn steps 3 meters forward with each step.
2. Since they are walking side-by-side, we can multiply the number of unicorns by the distance each unicorn steps: 6 unicorns * 3 meters/step = 18 meters per step.
3. The total distance the unicorns are walking is 9 kilometers, which is equal to 9000 meters (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters).
4. Since the unicorns are walking 18 meters per step, we can divide the total distance by the distance per step to find the total number of steps: 9000 meters / 18 meters/step = 500 steps.
5. Since each step causes 4 flowers to bloom, we can multiply the total number of steps by the number of flowers per step: 500 steps * 4 flowers/step = 2000 flowers.

Answer: 2000
