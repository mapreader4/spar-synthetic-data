Let's break this down step by step.

1. The guy buys 5 sets of drill bits, and each set costs 6 dollars. So, the total cost of the drill bits is:

5 x 6 = 30

2. He then pays 10% tax on the order. To find the amount of tax, we multiply the total cost by 0.1:

30 x 0.1 = 3

3. The total amount he paid is the total cost of the drill bits plus the tax:

30 + 3 = 33

Answer: 33
