Let's break this problem down step by step.

James orders an 8 piece pizza. So, there are 8 slices initially.

His friend eats 2 slices. So, 2 slices are gone.

James eats half of what is left. So, we need to find half of the remaining slices.

There are 8 - 2 = 6 slices left.

James eats half of the remaining 6 slices. So, James eats 3 slices.
