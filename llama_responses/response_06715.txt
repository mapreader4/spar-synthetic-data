Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Christine throws the ball 20 feet high on her first throw. Janice's first throw is 4 feet lower than Christine's, so Janice's first throw is 20 - 4 = 16 feet high.

On their second throw, Christine throws the ball 10 feet higher than her first throw, which is 20 + 10 = 30 feet high. Janice throws the ball twice as high as her first throw, which is 2 x 16 = 32 feet high.

On their final throw, Christine throws the ball 4 feet higher than her second throw, which is 30 + 4 = 34 feet high. Janice throws the ball 17 feet higher than Christine's first throw, which is 20 + 17 = 37 feet high.

So, the height of the highest throw is 37 feet.
