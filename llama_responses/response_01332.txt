Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

1. Mehki is 10 years older than Jordyn.
2. Jordyn's age is double Zrinka's age.
3. Zrinka is 6 years old.

From the second statement, we know that Jordyn's age is double Zrinka's age. Since Zrinka is 6 years old, Jordyn's age is 2 x 6 = 12 years.

Now, we need to find Mehki's age. We know that Mehki is 10 years older than Jordyn. So, Mehki's age is 12 + 10 = 22 years.

Answer: 22
