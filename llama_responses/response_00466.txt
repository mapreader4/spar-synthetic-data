Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mark gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year. That means he has a total of 20 days off per year.

2. He uses half of each type of day, so he uses 5 sick days and 5 vacation days in a year.

3. Each day is an 8-hour workday, so 5 sick days * 8 hours = 40 hours and 5 vacation days * 8 hours = 40 hours.

4. In total, Mark has used 40 + 40 = 80 hours of days.

5. Since there are 8 hours in a day, 80 hours is equal to 10 days.

Answer: 10
