Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total monthly cost of the first apartment. The rent is $800 per month, and the utilities are an additional $260 per month, so the total cost of the first apartment is:

$800 + $260 = $1060 per month

Next, let's calculate the total monthly cost of the first apartment after factoring in driving-related costs. The man would have to drive 31 miles per day, 20 days a month, which is a total of:

31 miles/day x 20 days/month = 620 miles per month

The cost of driving these miles is:

620 miles x 58 cents/mile = $359.80 per month

So, the total monthly cost of the first apartment, including utilities and driving-related costs, is:

$1060 + $359.80 = $1419.80 per month

Now, let's do the same calculation for the second apartment. The rent is $900 per month, and the utilities are an additional $200 per month, so the total cost of the second apartment is:

$900 + $200 = $1100 per month

The man would have to drive 21 miles per day, 20 days a month, which is a total of:

21 miles/day x 20 days/month = 420 miles per month

The cost of driving these miles is:

420 miles x 58 cents/mile = $243.60 per month

So, the total monthly cost of the second apartment, including utilities and driving-related costs, is:

$1100 + $243.60 = $1343.60 per month

Now, let's calculate the difference between the total monthly costs of the two apartments:

$1419.80 - $1343.60 = $76.20
