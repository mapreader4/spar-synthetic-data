Let's break this down step by step.

Bill needs to soak his clothes for 4 minutes to get rid of each grass stain. Since there are 3 grass stains, that means he needs to soak his clothes for 3 x 4 = 12 minutes to get rid of the grass stains.

Additionally, he needs to soak his clothes for 7 minutes to get rid of each marinara stain. Since there is only 1 marinara stain, that means he needs to soak his clothes for 7 minutes to get rid of the marinara stain.

To find the total time, we add the time needed to get rid of the grass stains and the time needed to get rid of the marinara stain. So, Bill needs to soak his clothes for 12 + 7 = 19 minutes.
