Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say there was x dollars in the cookie jar initially.

Doris spent $6, so the amount left is x - 6.

Martha spent half as much as Doris, so Martha spent 6/2 = 3 dollars.

So, the amount left in the cookie jar is x - 6 - 3 = x - 9.

We know that there is $15 left in the cookie jar, so we can set up an equation:

x - 9 = 15

To solve for x, we can add 9 to both sides:

x = 15 + 9

x = 24

So, there were $24 in the cookie jar initially.
