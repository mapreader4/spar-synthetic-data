Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of teachers. There are 30 teachers at Esme's school.

Next, let's identify the number of staff members. There are 45 staff members.

Now, let's find the number of teachers who ate pizza. 2/3 of the teachers ate pizza. We can write this as a fraction: 2/3 * 30 = 20.

Next, let's find the number of staff members who ate pizza. 4/5 of the staff members ate pizza. We can write this as a fraction: 4/5 * 45 = 36.

Now, let's subtract the number of teachers who ate pizza from the total number of staff members. 20 + 36 = 56.

To find the number of non-pizza eaters, we subtract the number of staff members who ate pizza from the total number of staff members. 45 - 56 = 11.

Answer: 11
