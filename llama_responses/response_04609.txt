Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say Lizette's score on the first quiz is x.
2. Let's say her score on the second quiz is y.
3. The average of the two scores is (x + y) / 2.
4. The average is given as 94, so (x + y) / 2 = 94.
5. To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get 2(x) = 188.
6. Since the average is 94, we can subtract 94 from both sides to get 188 - 94 = 94.
7. So, the value of x is 94.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 94
