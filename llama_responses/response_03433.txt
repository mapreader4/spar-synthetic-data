To find the number of miles the first runner has covered, we can multiply the time taken so far by the speed: 56 minutes * 8 minutes per mile = 448 miles.  The second runner has run for 56 minutes, which is 56 / 7 = 8 miles.  The first runner is 448 / 8 = 56 miles behind the second runner.  To catch up, the first runner must run for 56 miles, so the time taken will be 56 / 7 = 8 minutes per mile.  So, the second runner can stop for 56 - 8 = 48 minutes before the first runner catches up.  Answer: 48.
