Let's break this problem down step by step.

Kevin can eat 64 wings in 8 minutes, so we can find his rate of eating wings by dividing 64 by 8:

64 wings / 8 minutes = 8 wings per minute

Now, we know that Alan can eat 5 wings per minute. To beat Kevin's record, Alan needs to eat more wings per minute. Let's find the difference:

8 wings/minute (Kevin's rate) - 5 wings/minute (Alan's rate) = 3 wings/minute

So, Alan needs to eat 3 more wings per minute to beat Kevin's record.
