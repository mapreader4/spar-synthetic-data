Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of cars on the highway is x. We know that the total number of vehicles is 300. Since the number of trucks is twice the number of cars, we can set up the equation 2x = 300. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us x = 150.

Answer: 150
