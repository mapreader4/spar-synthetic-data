Let's start by identifying the length of rope that Tanesha wants to cut into pieces. She wants to cut the rope into 10 pieces, each 6 inches long. So the total length of rope needed is 10 * 6 = 60 inches. The 6-foot length of rope costs $5, so the cost of the 6-foot rope is $5. The 1-foot lengths of rope cost $1.25 each. So the cost of the 1-foot ropes is 1 * 1.25 = $1.25. Now we need to find the total cost of the rope needed. The total cost of the rope needed is the cost of the 6-foot rope plus the cost of the 1-foot ropes. The cost of the 6-foot rope is $5, and the cost of the 1-foot ropes is $1.25. The total cost is 5 + 1.25 = $6.25. The least Tanesha has to spend is the cost of the rope needed, which is $6.25.
