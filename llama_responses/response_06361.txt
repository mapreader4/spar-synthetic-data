Let's break this down step by step:

1. Harrison read 10 more pages than the assigned amount of 25 pages, so Harrison read 25 + 10 = 35 pages.
2. Pam read 15 more pages than Harrison, so Pam read 35 + 15 = 50 pages.
3. Sam read twice the amount of Pam, so Sam read 50 x 2 = 100 pages.

Answer: 100
