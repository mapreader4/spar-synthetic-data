Let's break this down step by step.

Yun had 20 paperclips initially.

Then, Yun lost 12 paperclips.

So, Yun has 20 - 12 = 8 paperclips.

Marion has 1/4 more than Yun currently has, so Marion has 8 + 1/4 = 8 + 2 = 10 paperclips.

Marion has 7 more than Yun, so Marion has 10 + 7 = 17 paperclips.

Answer: 17
