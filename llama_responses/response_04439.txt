Let's break this problem down step by step.

The shirt is bought for $20, but the store charges 30% profit. So, the profit is 30% of the selling price, which is 30% of 20, which is 6. So, the selling price is 20 + 6 = 26.

However, the shirt is on sale for 50% off the selling price. So, we need to subtract 50% of 26 from 26. 50% of 26 is 13, so we subtract 13 from 26, leaving us with a price of 13.

So, the price of the shirt is 13.
