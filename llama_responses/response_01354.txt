Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the area of the area that Archie needs to sod. The area of the backyard is 20 yards by 13 yards, which can be written as 20 * 13 = 260 square yards.

Step 2: Find the area of the area that the shed takes up. The area of the shed is 3 yards by 5 yards, which can be written as 3 * 5 = 15 square yards.

Step 3: Subtract the area of the shed from the total area of the backyard. The area of the backyard minus the area of the shed is 260 - 15 = 245 square yards.

Step 4: The answer is the area of the backyard that Archie needs to sod. The answer is 245 square yards.
