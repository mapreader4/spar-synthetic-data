Let's break this down step by step.

Katy brought 3 bags of flour, which is 3 x 5 = 15 pounds.

Wendi brought twice as much flour as Katy, so Wendi brought 2 x 15 = 30 pounds.

Carrie brought 5 pounds less than the amount of flour Wendi brought, so Carrie brought 30 - 5 = 25 pounds.

To find the difference in pounds, we subtract Katy's flour from Carrie's flour: 25 - 15 = 10 pounds.

Now, we need to convert 10 pounds to ounces. There are 16 ounces in 1 pound, so 10 pounds is equal to 10 x 16 = 160 ounces.

Answer: 160
