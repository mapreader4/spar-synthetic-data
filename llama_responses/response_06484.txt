Let's start by letting x be Frank's age. We know that Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank, so Gabriel's age is x - 3.

The total of their ages is 17, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x - 3) = 17

To solve for x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:

x + x - 3 + 3 = 17 + 3

This simplifies to:

x + x = 20

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

x = 10

So Frank is 10 years old.
