Let's break this down step by step.

1. Santino has 2 papaya trees, which produce papayas. Each papaya tree produces 10 papayas, so the total number of papayas from the papaya trees is 2 x 10 = 20 papayas.

2. Santino also has 3 mango trees, which produce mangos. Each mango tree produces 20 mangos, so the total number of mangos from the mango trees is 3 x 20 = 60 mangos.

3. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of papayas and mangos: 20 (papayas) + 60 (mangos) = 80.

Answer: 80
