Let's break it down step by step.

1. Matt uses 2 pounds of flour to make a batch of cookies. Each bag of flour weighs 5 pounds. So, 2 pounds of flour is the same as 2 x 5 = 10 bags of flour.
2. He uses 4 bags of flour each, which is 4 x 5 = 20 bags of flour.
3. So, he uses 20 bags of flour in total.
4. Since 2 pounds of flour is the same as 10 bags of flour, and he uses 20 bags of flour, he uses 10 bags of flour to make the batch.
5. 10 bags of flour are used out of 20 bags. So, there are 10 bags of flour left over.

Answer: 10
