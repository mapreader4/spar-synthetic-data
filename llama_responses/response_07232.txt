Let's break it down step by step.

Emma started with 230 dollars in her bank account.
She withdrew 60 dollars, so she has 230 - 60 = 170 dollars left.
The next week, she deposited 2 times as much money as she withdrew. That means she deposited 2 * 60 = 120 dollars.
So, in total, she deposited 120 dollars.
So, she now has 170 + 120 = 290 dollars in her bank account.

Answer: 290
