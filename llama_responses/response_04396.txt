Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The area of the forest is 4 miles by 6 miles, so the area is 24 square miles. Since each square mile has 600 trees, the total number of trees is 24 * 600 = 14,400 trees.

2. Each logger can cut 6 trees per day. So, the total number of trees cut in a day is 6 trees.

3. There are 30 days in each month, so the total number of days is 30 days.

4. To find the total number of trees cut in a month, we multiply the number of trees cut per day by the number of days in a month: 6 * 30 = 180 trees.

5. To find the number of months needed to cut all the trees, we divide the total number of trees by the number of trees cut per day in a month: 14,400 / 180 = 80 months.

Answer: 80
