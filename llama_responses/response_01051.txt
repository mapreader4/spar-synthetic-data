Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information given in the problem. The Reptile House has 5 fewer animals than 3 times the number of animals housed in the Rain Forest exhibit. So, if we let x be the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit, we can write the equation as:

16 = 3x - 5

Now, we can solve for x. We can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get:

16 + 5 = 3x

Then, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:

11 = 3x

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get:

11 / 3 = x

x = 3.67

So, the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit is 3.67.
