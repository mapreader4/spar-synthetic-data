To find the total number of days Cassidy is grounded for, we need to calculate the total number of days for the 4 grades below a B, and then add that to the 14 days for lying.

For 4 grades below a B, Cassidy will get 4 x 3 = 12 extra days. So, the total number of days Cassidy is grounded for is 14 + 12 = 26.
