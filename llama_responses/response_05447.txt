Let's break this down step by step.

1. Jason fills the pot with 41 degrees water. The water needs to reach 212 degrees, so it needs to increase by 171 degrees. It takes 57 minutes to increase the temperature by 171 degrees (since 212 - 41 = 171 and 171 / 3 = 57).

2. After the water reaches 212 degrees, Jason needs to cook the pasta for 12 minutes.

3. Then, it takes him 1/3 that long to mix the pasta with the sauce and make a salad. 12 minutes is the time to cook the pasta, and 1/3 of 12 is 4.

So, it takes Jason 57 + 12 + 4 minutes to cook dinner. 57 + 12 = 69 and 69 + 4 = 73.
