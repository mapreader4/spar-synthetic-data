Let's start by using the information we know: Eden's mom is twice as old as Eden. So, if Eden is 12 years old, then Eden's mom is 24 years old.

Since Devin is twice as old as Eden, and Eden is 12 years old, then Devin must be 24 x 2 = 24 years old.

Now, the average age of the three is the sum of their ages divided by 3:

(12 + 24 + 24) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20

Answer: 20
