Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of bedbugs the group started with is x.

After one day, the number of bedbugs would be 3x. After two days, the number of bedbugs would be 3 * 3x = 9x. After three days, the number of bedbugs would be 3 * 9x = 27x. After four days, the number of bedbugs would be 3 * 27x = 81x.

We know that after four days, there were 810 bedbugs burrowing into the mattress. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

81x = 810

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 81:

x = 810 / 81

x = 10

So, the group started with 10 bedbugs.
