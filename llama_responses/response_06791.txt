Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find out how many stickers each person got. Since the ratio is 1:1:3, it means that Susan got 1 part and Andrew got 3 parts. Since the total number of parts is 4 (1+3), and there are 1500 stickers in total, each part is 1500/4 = 375.

Now, Sam got 1 part, so Sam got 375 stickers.

Andrew got 3 parts, so Andrew got 3 x 375 = 1125 stickers.

Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his 1125 stickers. Two-thirds of 1125 is 1125 * (2/3) = 750.

So, Andrew now has 1125 - 750 = 375 stickers.
