Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of hours Lila watched.

Since Lila watched the video at two times the average speed, she watched it for 2 x 100 hours, which is 200 hours.

Now, let's find the total number of hours Roger watched.

Since Roger watched the video at the average speed, he watched it for 100 hours.

Now, we need to find the total number of hours they both watched.

Lila watched 200 hours, and Roger watched 100 hours. To find the total, we add those hours together:

200 + 100 = 300

So, the total number of hours they both watched is 300.

Answer: 300
