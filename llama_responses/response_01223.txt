Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Steven fell 3 times.
* Stephanie fell more times than Steven, which means Stephanie fell 3 + 13 = 16 times.
* Sonya fell 2 times less than half of the number of times Stephanie fell, which means Sonya fell 16 / 2 = 8 times.

So, Sonya fell 16 - 8 = 8 times.

Answer: 8
