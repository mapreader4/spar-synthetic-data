Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Aliyah has 10 more phones than Vivienne, and Vivienne has 40 phones.

To find out how many phones Aliyah has, we can add 10 to 40, which gives us 50 phones.

The total number of phones the sisters have is 50 (Vivienne's 40) + 10 (Aliyah's 10) = 50.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together. Since each phone is sold at $400, we multiply the number of phones by 400.

50 phones * 400 = 20,000.

Answer: 20,000
