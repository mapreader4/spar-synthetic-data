Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: We know that Arlene hiked 24 miles in 6 hours. To find her average hiking pace, we need to divide the distance by the time.

Step 2: The formula to find the average speed is: speed = distance / time.

Step 3: Plug in the values: speed = 24 miles / 6 hours.

Step 4: Calculate the speed: speed = 24 miles / 6 hours = 4 miles per hour.
