Let's break it down step by step.

Johnny bought 15 packs of colored pencils. Each pack has 3 pencils of different colors. Let's assume that each pack has 1 red pencil. So, the total number of red pencils is 3 x 15 = 45.

However, 3 of the 15 packs have 2 red pencils. So, the number of red pencils in these 3 packs is 2 x 3 = 6.

So, the total number of red pencils Johnny bought is 45 - 6 = 39.
