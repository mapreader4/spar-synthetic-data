Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find the total amount of fruit needed for 4 batches of muffins, with each batch taking 12 ounces of fruit. Since there are 4 batches, the total amount of fruit needed is:

4 batches x 12 ounces/batch = 48 ounces

Since blueberries come in 6-ounce cartons, we'll need:

48 ounces / 6 ounces/carton = 8 cartons of blueberries

The cost of blueberries would be:

8 cartons x $5.00/carton = $40.00

Raspberries come in 8-ounce cartons, so we'll need:

48 ounces / 8 ounces/carton = 6 cartons of raspberries

The cost of raspberries would be:

6 cartons x $3.00/carton = $18.00

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of raspberries from the cost of blueberries:

$40.00 - $18.00 = $22.00
