Let's break this down step by step.

Megan works 8 hours a day and earns $7.50 per hour.  To find her daily earnings, we can multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day:

$7.50 x 8 = $60.00

So, her daily earnings are $60.00.

Since she works 20 days a month, we can multiply her daily earnings by the number of days in a month:

$60.00 x 20 = $1200.00

So, her total earnings for 2 months of work will be $1200.00.

Answer: 1200
