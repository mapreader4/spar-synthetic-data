Let's break it down step by step.

If the fastest speed of a rabbit is x, then we know that the speed of the rabbit doubled is 2x.

If we double that speed again, we get 4x.

Now, if we add 4 to 4x, we get 4x + 4.

If we double 4x + 4 again, we get 8x + 4.

And if we simplify that, we get 8x + 4.

The question is asking us what the speed of the rabbit is. So, we need to solve for x.

We know that 8x + 4 is 188. So, we can solve for x.

To do that, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

8x + 4 = 188

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

8x = 184

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 23

So, the speed of the rabbit is 23.
