Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the application fees. The application fee is $25.00 for each college application, and she is applying to 6 colleges. So, the total cost of the application fees is 6 x 25.00 = 150.00.

Step 2: Determine how many hours she needs to babysit to cover the application fees. She makes $10.00 an hour babysitting. So, we need to divide the total cost of the application fees by her hourly rate. 150.00 / 10.00 = 15.

Answer: 15
