Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Tod drives 55 miles to the north. So, to find the distance traveled to the north, we need to find the time taken for that distance.

Distance to the north = 55 miles
Time taken = Distance / Speed
Time taken for 55 miles = 55 / 25 = 2.2 hours

2. Tod then drives 95 miles to the west. So, to find the time taken for that distance, we need to find the time taken for that distance.

Distance to the west = 95 miles
Time taken = Distance / Speed
Time taken for 95 miles = 95 / 25 = 3.8 hours

3. Now, we need to find the total time taken for the entire trip.

Total time taken = Time taken for north + Time taken for west
Total time taken = 2.2 + 3.8 = 6 hours
