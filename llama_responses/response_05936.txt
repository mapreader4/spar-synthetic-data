Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Let's start by identifying the given information: Traci brought flour from her own house and Harris has 400g of flour in his house.
2. Each cake needs 100g of flour, and they have created 9 cakes each. So, the total amount of flour needed for 9 cakes is 9 x 100g = 900g.
3. Since Harris has 400g of flour, and they have created 9 cakes each, the amount of flour Traci brought must be 400g - 900g = 500g.

Answer: 500
