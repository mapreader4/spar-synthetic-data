Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of people on John's father's side. This is given as 10.

Then, we know that his mother's side is 30% larger than his father's side.  30% of 10 is 30/100 x 10 = 3.

So, we can add the number of people on his father's side to the number of people on his mother's side.  10 + 3 = 13.

Answer: 13
