Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total amount of money earned by Sab and Dane.

Sab and Dane sold 6 pairs of shoes that cost $3 each. So, the total amount of money earned from selling the shoes is:

6 * 3 = 18

Sab and Dane sold 18 shirts that cost $2 each. So, the total amount of money earned from selling the shirts is:

18 * 2 = 36

The total amount of money earned by Sab and Dane is the sum of the money earned from the shoes and the shirts:

18 + 36 = 54

Since there are 2 people, we need to divide the total amount of money earned by 2:

54 / 2 = 27

Answer: 27
