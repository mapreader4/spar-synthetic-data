Let's break down the information given into variables.

Let's say the price of each of the 5 other pieces is x.

We know that the total cost of the 7 pieces is 610 dollars.

We can set up an equation using the information given:

7 * x + 49 + 81 = 610

To solve for x, we can subtract 49 and 81 from both sides of the equation:

7 * x + 49 + 81 = 610

7 * x = 610 - 49 - 81

7 * x = 480

x = 68

So, the other 5 pieces were 68 dollars each.
