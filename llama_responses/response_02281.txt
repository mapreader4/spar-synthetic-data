Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of servings Willow's recipe makes: 1 serving of 4 pancakes. Since each of the girls wanted a serving and a half of pancakes, that's 1.5 servings each. Since there are 3 girls, the total number of servings needed for the girls is 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 servings. Willow's son wanted 3 servings, so the total number of servings needed is 4.5 + 3 = 7.5.

Since Willow's recipe makes 1 serving of 4 pancakes, the number of single pancakes Willow will need to make is 7.5 x 4 = 30 pancakes.
