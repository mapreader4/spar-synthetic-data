Let's start by using the information given. We know that a quarter of the number is 27. So, we can set up an equation.

Let the number be x.

A quarter of x is 27. So, we can write an equation:

(1/4) x = 27

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 27 * 4
x = 108

So, the number is 108.

Answer: 108
