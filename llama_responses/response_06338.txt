Let's break it down step by step.

The phone costs $1000, so the case will cost 20% of that, which is 0.2 x 1000 = 200. The headphones will cost half as much as the case, which is 0.5 x 200 = 100.

So, Lisa will spend 200 + 100 = 300 on the case and headphones. Then, she will spend 200 on the phone contract.

In total, Lisa will spend 300 + 200 = 500 on her phone in the first year.
