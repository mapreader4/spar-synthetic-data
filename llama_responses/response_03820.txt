Let's break this down step by step.

First, it takes Jack 4 minutes to put his shoes on. Then, for each of the 2 toddlers, it takes 3 minutes to help them with their shoes. So, we add 2 minutes for each of the 2 toddlers, which is 2 x 2 = 4 minutes. Then, we add the time it takes Jack to put his shoes on, which is 4 minutes. So, in total, it takes Jack 4 + 4 = 8 minutes to get ready.
