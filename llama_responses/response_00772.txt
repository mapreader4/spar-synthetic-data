Let's break this down step by step.

Kylie picks apples for 3 hours. The first hour she picks 66 apples.

The second hour she doubles her apple picking rate, so she picks 66 * 2 = 132 apples.

The third hour she picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour. So, she picks 66 / 3 = 22 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked, we add the apples picked in each hour: 66 + 132 + 22 = 220.

Answer: 220
