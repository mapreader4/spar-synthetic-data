Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Charley pulls out 1/6 of the black beads. To find 1/6 of the black beads, we can multiply the total number of black beads (90) by 1/6, which gives us 15 black beads.

Step 2: Charley also pulls out a third of the white beads. To find a third of the white beads, we can multiply the total number of white beads (51) by 1/3, which gives us 17 white beads.

Step 3: Now, let's add the number of black beads and white beads that Charley pulled out. 15 (black) + 17 (white) = 32.

Answer: 32
