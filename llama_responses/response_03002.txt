Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Each tray of banana pudding needs 80 wafer cookies.
* There are 3 trays of banana pudding, so the total number of wafer cookies needed is 3 x 80 = 240.
* Each box of wafer cookies has 60 cookies, so the number of boxes needed is 240 รท 60 = 4.
* Each box of wafer cookies costs $3.50.

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box:

4 boxes x $3.50 per box = $14.00
