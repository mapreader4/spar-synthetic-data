Let's start by identifying the number of students in class A. 40% of the 80 students are in class A, so we can set up an equation to solve for the number of students in class A:

Let x be the number of students in class A.
40% of the 80 students are in class A, so we can write the equation:

0.4x = 32

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 80 / 0.4
x = 200

So, there are 200 students in class A.

Now, we know that class B has 21 students fewer than class A, so we can subtract 21 from 200 to find the number of students in class B:

200 - 21 = 179

There are 179 students in class B.

The remaining students are in class C, so we can subtract 179 from 80 to find the number of students in class C:

80 - 179 = 1

There is 1 student in class C.
