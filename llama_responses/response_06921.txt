Let's break it down step by step.

Yanni had $0.85 initially.

He received $0.40 more from his mother, so he now has a total of $0.85 + $0.40 = $1.25.

Then, he found $0.50 while going to the mall.

He bought a toy that cost $1.6, so he spent $1.6.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the total he had:

$1.25 - $1.6 = $0.65

Answer: 65
