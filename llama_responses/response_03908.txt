Let's break this down step by step.

Michael takes a bath twice a week. So, that is 2 times a week. And he takes a shower once a week. So, that is 1 time a week. To get clean, he does these things 52 times in a year. 

So, he takes a bath 2 x 26 times and a shower 1 x 52 times. 

Answer: 2 * 26 + 1 * 52 = 76.
