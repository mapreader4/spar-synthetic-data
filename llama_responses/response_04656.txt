Let's start by identifying the total number of fruits Mary has.

Mary has 14 apples, 9 oranges, and 6 blueberries, so the total number of fruits she has is:

14 + 9 + 6 = 19

Mary ate 1 of each fruit, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of fruits.

19 - 1 = 18

So, Mary has 18 fruits left.
