Let's break down the cost of the cable television service into parts:

1. The basic cable television service costs $15 per month.
2. The movie channels cost $12 per month, so the total cost of the movie channels is $12.
3. The sports channels cost $3 less than the movie channels, so the cost of the sports channels is $12 - $3 = $9.
4. To find the total cost of the cable television service with both the movie channels and the sports channels, we add the cost of the basic service, the movie channels, and the sports channels: $15 + $12 + $9 = $36.

So, the total monthly payment will be $36.
