Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by finding out how much Margarita ran. She ran for 18 feet, and then jumped 1 foot less than twice Ricciana's jump. Since Ricciana jumped 4 feet, 2 x 4 = 8 feet, so Margarita jumped 8 - 1 = 7 feet. So, Margarita ran 18 + 7 = 25 feet.

Ricciana ran 24 feet - 20 feet for running and 4 feet for jumping, so she ran 20 + 4 = 24 feet. To find out how much farther Margarita ran and jumped than Ricciana, we need to subtract 24 from 25.

24 - 25 = -1.

Answer: -1
