Let's break down the information given into parts.

Mike bought 12 notebooks. 3 red notebooks at 4 dollars each will cost 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. 2 green notebooks at 2 dollars each will cost 2 * 2 = 4 dollars. So, the remaining notebooks are 12 - 12 = 0 dollars. 0 dollars are spent on blue notebooks.  Since the total spent on blue notebooks is 0 dollars, there is no cost for each blue notebook.  So, the cost of each blue notebook is 0 dollars.
