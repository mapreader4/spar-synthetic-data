Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we find the area of each square.

The first square is 8 feet by 5 feet, so its area is 8 * 5 = 40 square feet.

The second square is 10 feet by 7 feet, so its area is 10 * 7 = 70 square feet.

The third square is 5 feet by 5 feet, so its area is 5 * 5 = 25 square feet.

Now, we need to find the total area of all the squares and then add it to get the area of the flag.

The total area is 40 + 70 + 25 = 135 square feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the flag. The flag will be 15 feet long. Since the area is 135 square feet, the height of the flag is 135 / 15 = 9 feet.
