Let's start by adding the number of sparklers and whistlers from Koby's boxes.

Koby's boxes have 2 x 3 = 6 sparklers and 2 x 5 = 10 whistlers, so in total, Koby has 6 + 10 = 16 fireworks.

Now, let's add the number of sparklers and whistlers from Cherie's box.

Cherie's box has 8 sparklers and 9 whistlers, so in total, Cherie has 8 + 9 = 17 fireworks.

To find the total number of fireworks that Koby and Cherie have, we add the number of fireworks from both of their boxes.

Koby has 16 fireworks and Cherie has 17 fireworks, so in total, they have 16 + 17 = 33 fireworks.

Answer: 33
