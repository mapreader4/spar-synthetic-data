Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jake has 3 snakes, each of which lays 2 eggs. So, he has a total of 3 x 2 = 6 eggs.

2. He sells most of the baby snakes for $250 each, so he sells 6 eggs for 6 x $250 = $1500.

3. But one of the snakes is super rare, and it costs 4 times as much as the others. So, this snake costs 4 x $250 = $1000.

4. Jake sells this snake for $1000, so his total income is $1500 + $1000 = $2500.

Answer: 2500
