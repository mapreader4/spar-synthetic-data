Let's break down the problem step by step.

The factory was initially planning to produce 200 cars. Then they decreased the production by 50 cars, so the new number of cars they planned to produce is 200 - 50 = 150.

Then, they had to cut production by another 50%. 50% of 150 is 0.5 x 150 = 75. So, they cut the production by 75 cars.

So, the new number of cars they will produce is 150 - 75 = 75.

Answer: 75
