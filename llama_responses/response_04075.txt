Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley, which is 20.

Let's say Richard's age is x. Then, Hurley's age will be x - 20.

We know that Hurley's age is 14, so we can set up the equation x - 20 = 14.

To solve for x, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation to get x = 14 + 20.

x = 34.

Now, let's find the combined ages 40 years from now.

To find the combined ages 40 years from now, we need to add 40 to their current ages.

Richard's age is x, and Hurley's age is 14. So, their combined ages 40 years from now will be x + 14 + 40.

Substituting x with 34, we get 34 + 14 + 40.

34 + 14 = 48.

Answer: 48
