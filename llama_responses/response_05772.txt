Let's break this down step by step.

Will's mom gave him $74 to go shopping. He bought a sweater for $9. So, he spent $9. That leaves him with $74 - $9 = $65.

Then, he bought a T-shirt for $11. So, he spent another $11. That leaves him with $65 - $11 = $54.

Next, he bought a pair of shoes for $30. But then he returned the shoes for a 90% refund. That means he got back 90% of the $30 back, which is $27. So, he got $27 back. So, he now has $54 - $27 = $27.

So, the final answer is:

Answer: 27
