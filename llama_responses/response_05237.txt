Let's break down the problem step by step:

Wanda walks her daughter.5 miles to school in the morning and then walks.5 miles home. This is her round trip distance for a day. Since she does this 5 days a week, the total distance she walks in a week is:

.5 x 5 = 2.5 miles

Now, Wanda walks her daughter to school 5 days a week. After 4 weeks, the total distance she walks is:

2.5 x 4 = 10 miles
