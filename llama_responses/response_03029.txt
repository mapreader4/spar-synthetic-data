Let's break it down step by step.

Mr. Roper cuts his lawn 15 days a month beginning in April and ending in September. 15 days is the same as 5 months.  So, he cuts his lawn 5 months.

From October to the end of March, he cuts his lawn three times a month. So, he cuts his lawn 3 times in each of the 4 months: October, November, December, and January. 3 x 4 = 12.

The average number of times Mr. Roper cuts his yard per month is 12 / 5 = 2.4. 2.4 is the answer.
