I think step by step, stating my reasoning before stating any conclusions.

First, I know that Steve is 5 feet tall. 5 feet is equal to 60 inches.

Next, I know that Steve grows 6 inches. 6 inches is the same as 0.5 feet.

Then, I add 0.5 feet to 5 feet to get the new height of Steve. 5 feet + 0.5 feet = 5.5 feet.

So, Steve is 5.5 feet tall.
