Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Bennett sold 8800 window screens in March, and a fourth of that number is equal to the number of window screens he sold in February. So, we can set up an equation:

8800 = 4x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 8800 / 4
x = 2200

So, Bennett sold 2200 window screens in February. To find the total number of window screens Bennett sold from January to March, we need to add 2200 to 2200, which is the number he sold in March.

Answer: 4400
