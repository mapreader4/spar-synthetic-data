Let's break it down step by step.

Lola made 13 mini cupcakes and Lulu made 16 mini cupcakes. That's a total of 13 + 16 = 29 mini cupcakes.

Lola made 10 pop tarts and Lulu made 12 pop tarts. That's a total of 10 + 12 = 22 pop tarts.

Lola made 8 blueberry pies and Lulu made 14 blueberry pies. That's a total of 8 + 14 = 22 blueberry pies.

Adding all the pastries together, we get 29 mini cupcakes + 22 pop tarts + 22 blueberry pies = 29 + 22 + 22 = 73.

Answer: 73
