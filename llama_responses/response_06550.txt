Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the total number of hybrids.

60% of the cars are hybrids, so 0.6 * 600 = 360 hybrids.

Step 2: Identify the number of hybrids with one headlight.

40% of the hybrids contain one headlight, so 0.4 * 360 = 144 hybrids contain one headlight.

Step 3: Find the number of hybrids with full headlights.

Since we want to find the number of hybrids with full headlights, we need to subtract the number of hybrids with one headlight from the total number of hybrids.

360 (total hybrids) - 144 (hybrids with one headlight) = 216 hybrids with full headlights.

Answer: 216
