Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the total number of fruits: 10 apples and 6 oranges. So, there are 16 fruits in total.

Now, let's find the total cost of the fruits. 10 apples at $0.80 each will cost 10 x $0.80 = $8.00. 6 oranges at $0.50 each will cost 6 x $0.50 = $3.00. The total cost of the fruits is $8.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

So, the cafeteria earns $11.00.
