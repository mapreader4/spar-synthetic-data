Let's break it down step by step:

1. The jury selection takes 2 days.
2. The trial itself lasts 4 times as long as jury selection. So, the trial takes 2 * 4 = 8 days.
3. The jury spends 6 full days in deliberation, which is equivalent to 6 * 24 = 144 hours.
4. The jury spends 16 hours a day in deliberation. So, the total hours spent in deliberation is 144 hours.

To find the total number of days spent on jury duty, we need to add the hours spent in jury selection (2 days = 48 hours) to the hours spent in deliberation (144 hours). 

48 + 144 = 192 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day. So, we need to divide the total hours by 24 to get the number of days.

192 hours รท 24 = 8 days.
