Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Jack recycles 80 bottles and gets 10 cents per bottle. So, he earns 80 x 10 cents, which is 800 cents. Now, we know that he made 15 dollars. We can set up an equation to represent this:

10 x 80 + 5x = 1500

We are trying to find the value of x. We can subtract 10 x 80 from both sides of the equation to get:

5x = 1500 - 800

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = (1500 - 800) / 5

x = 200

So, the answer is 200.
