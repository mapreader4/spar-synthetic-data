Let us denote the number of fish Chris caught per trip as c. Since Brian goes fishing 2/5 times fewer times than Chris, he catches c/5 fish per trip. So, the number of fish Brian catches per trip is (c/5). Since Brian went fishing 10 times, he caught 10 * (c/5) fish. The total number of fish they caught together is the sum of the number of fish Brian caught, which is 10 * (c/5), and the number of fish Chris caught, which is 10 * c. The total number of fish they caught together is 10 * (c/5) + 10 * c. To solve for c, we can write 10 * (c/5) + 10 * c = 400. This is because Brian caught 400 fish in total. So, we can solve for c as follows: 10 * (c/5) + 10 * c = 400. We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 10 * c, giving us c/5 + c = 40. Since Brian and Chris went fishing 10 times, the total number of fish they caught is 10 * 40 = 400. So, the answer is 400.
