Let's break it down step by step.

Javier spends 30 minutes outlining his speech. This is the foundation of his speech, so we can start with this as our starting point.

He then spends 28 minutes writing than outlining. This means he spends 30 + 28 = 58 minutes writing.

Finally, he spends half as much time practicing as writing. Since he spent 58 minutes writing, he spends 58 / 2 = 29 minutes practicing.

To find the total time spent on his speech, we add up the time spent outlining, writing, and practicing: 30 + 58 + 29 = 117 minutes.

Answer: 117
