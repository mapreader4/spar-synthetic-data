Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how much milk is consumed by Daisy's kids.

75% of 16 is 12.

Now, let's find out how much milk Daisy uses to cook with.

50% of 16 is 8.

Now, let's subtract the milk used by the kids and the milk used for cooking.

16 - 12 - 8 = 4

So, there is 4 cups of milk left over.
