Let's start by identifying the number of chickens. Let's say the number of chickens is x.

Jen has 10 more ducks than four times the number of chickens. This means that the number of ducks is 4x. So, we can set up an equation: 4x = 10 - x. To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 10 - 10. This gives us x = 0. So, the number of chickens is 0.

Now, we know that Jen has 150 ducks. We can find the total number of birds by adding the number of ducks to the number of chickens: 150 + 0 = 150. The answer is 150.
