Let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that the total number of calories in the sandwich is 1250.

Next, we know that the number of calories from the bacon is 2 strips of bacon, and each strip has 125 calories. So, the total number of calories from the bacon is 2 x 125 = 250.

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total calories come from the bacon. To do this, we will divide the number of calories from the bacon by the total number of calories in the sandwich.

250 (calories from bacon) รท 1250 (total calories in the sandwich) = 0.2

Answer: 20
