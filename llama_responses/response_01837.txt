Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the time it takes for Mr. Langsley to travel from the first station to his workplace. We know that the bus picks him up at 6:00 a.m. and it takes 40 minutes to arrive at the first station. So, the time taken to travel from the first station to the first station is 40 minutes.

Then, we need to find the time it takes for Mr. Langsley to travel from the first station to his workplace. We know that he arrives at work at 9:00 a.m. We can subtract the time it takes to travel from the first station from the arrival time to find the time taken to travel from the first station to his workplace.

Time taken from first station to workplace = Arrival time - Time taken to travel from first station
= 9:00 a.m. - 6:00 a.m. = 3 hours

So, the total time taken in minutes from the first station to Mr. Langsley's workplace is:

Answer: 180
