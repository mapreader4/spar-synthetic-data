Let's break it down step by step:

Let's first identify the amount of caffeine in the energy drink: 4 drinks of 120 mg each. So, the total amount of caffeine in the drinks is 4 x 120 = 480 mg.

Since the maximum safe amount of caffeine is 500 mg, and the amount of caffeine in the drinks is 480 mg, we can find the difference between the two amounts by subtracting 480 from 500.

The difference is 500 - 480 = 20 mg.

So, Brandy can safely consume 20 mg more caffeine that day.
