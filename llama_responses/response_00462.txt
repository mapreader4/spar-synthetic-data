Let's break this problem down step by step.

Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour, so in one hour, he will skip 4,200 jumps.

Valerie can skip 80 times a minute, so in one minute, she will skip 80 jumps.

In one hour, Roberto will skip 4,200 jumps, and Valerie will skip 80 jumps. Since they are jumping together, they will skip a total of 4,200 + 80 = 4,280 jumps.

Answer: 4280
