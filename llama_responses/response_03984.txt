Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of money Judson contributed. Let's call this amount "x".

Since Kenny contributed 20% more than Judson, and we know that Judson contributed x, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 0.2x = Judson's contribution

We can simplify this equation by subtracting x from both sides:

x = Judson's contribution - 0.2x

Now, we know that Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Camilo's contribution = Kenny's contribution + 200

We can simplify this equation by subtracting Kenny's contribution from both sides:

Camilo's contribution = Kenny's contribution - 200

We know that Kenny contributed 20% of the amount Judson contributed, which is x. So, we can substitute x for Kenny's contribution:

Camilo's contribution = x - 200

Now, we know that the total amount of money Judson and Kenny contributed is the total cost of painting the house. We can add their contributions together:

Total contribution = Judson's contribution + Kenny's contribution

We can simplify this equation by adding x and x:

Total contribution = x + x

We know that Judson contributed $500, so we can substitute this value for x:

Total contribution = 500 + x

We also know that Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny, so we can substitute 200 for x:

Total contribution = 500 + 200

The total cost of painting the house is the total contribution, which is 700.
