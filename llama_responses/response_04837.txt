Let's break this down step by step.

Fern buys one pair of high heels for $60.

Let's call the price of the high heels $x.

Fern buys five pairs of ballet slippers for 2/3rds of the price of the high heels. The price of the high heels is $x. So, the price of the ballet slippers is 2/3rds of $x, which is $20.

The total price of the ballet slippers is 5 * $20 = $100.

Fern pays the price of the high heels ($60) plus the price of the ballet slippers ($100). So, the total price is $60 + $100 = $160.

Answer: 160
