To solve this problem, I will think step by step, stating my reasoning before stating any conclusions.

Step 1: Calculate the number of messages each member would post in a day before the admin removed some members.

Each member posted 50 messages per day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of messages the remaining members would post in a week.

The number of messages the remaining members would post in a week is the total number of messages the remaining members would post in a day, multiplied by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

Step 3: Calculate the total number of messages the remaining members would send.

The total number of messages the remaining members would send in a week = 20 members * 50 messages per day * 7 days = 1400 messages.

Answer: 1400
