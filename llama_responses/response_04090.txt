Let's break this down step by step.

If you sold 220 chocolate cookies at $1 per cookie, you would make a total of 220 * $1 = $220.

If you sold 70 vanilla cookies at $2 per cookie, you would make a total of 70 * $2 = $140.

To find the total amount of money made, we add the money made from the chocolate cookies to the money made from the vanilla cookies: $220 + $140 = $360.

Answer: 360
