Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total area of the yard, excluding the sidewalk and flower beds. The yard is 200 feet wide by 50 feet, so the area is:

200 * 50 = 10,000 square feet

Next, we need to subtract the area of the sidewalk, which is 3 feet wide by 50 feet. The area of the sidewalk is:

3 * 50 = 150 square feet

Next, we need to subtract the area of the four flower beds. The two larger beds are 4 feet by 25 feet, so their area is:

4 * 25 = 100 square feet

The medium-sized bed is 10 feet by 12 feet, so its area is:

10 * 12 = 120 square feet

The small bed is 7 feet by 8 feet, so its area is:

7 * 8 = 56 square feet

The total area of the flower beds is the sum of these three areas:

100 + 120 + 56 = 276 square feet

Now, we need to subtract the area of the flower beds from the total area of the yard:

10,000 - 150 - 276 = 9,674 square feet

So, Jill will need 9,674 square feet of sod to cover her yard, minus the sidewalk and flower beds.
