Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how much pizza Nelly can buy. Each pizza can feed 3 people, and there are 15 people in total (Nelly and her 14 friends). So, Nelly can buy 15/3 = 5 pizzas. Since each pizza costs $12, the total cost of the pizzas is 5 x $12 = $60.

Next, we need to find out how much Nelly earns babysitting. She earns $4 per night, so if we divide the total cost of the pizzas ($60) by the amount she earns per night, we get 60 / 4 = 15 nights.

Answer: 15
