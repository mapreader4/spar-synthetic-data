Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say 60 individuals like football, and 50 of those 60 individuals like it, so the proportion of people who like football is 50%.

If 50% of the people who like football play it, then we can multiply 50% by the total number of people to find the number of people who play football.

The total number of people is 250, so we can multiply 50% by 250 to get the number of people who play football.

50% * 250 = 125

Answer: 125
