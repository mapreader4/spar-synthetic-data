Let's break it down step by step.

1. Julie's hourly rate is $5.
2. She works 8 hours a day, so her daily earnings are 5 * 8 = 40.
3. She works 6 days a week, so her weekly earnings are 40 * 6 = 240.
4. She did not go to work for a day, so she missed out on 1 day's pay.

So, her monthly salary is 240 - 5 = 235.

Answer: 235
