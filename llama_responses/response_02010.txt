Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of words Stan can type in an hour. He can type 50 words per minute. So in an hour, he can type 50 * 60 = 3000 words. Since his paper is 5 pages with 400 words each, he will need to type 5 * 400 = 2000 words. So he has 3000 - 2000 = 1000 words left. He can type 50 words per minute, so he can type 1000 / 50 = 20 minutes. Since he needs to drink 15 ounces of water every hour, he needs to drink 15 * 2 = 30 ounces of water while writing his paper. So his total water intake will be 30 ounces.
