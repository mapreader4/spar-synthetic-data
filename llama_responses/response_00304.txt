Let's start by calculating the total water used by each farmer.

Farmer Bob:
Corn: 3 acres x 20 gallons/acre = 60 gallons
Cotton: 9 acres x 80 gallons/acre = 720 gallons
Beans: 12 acres x 40 gallons/acre (since beans take twice as much water as corn) = 480 gallons
Total water used by Farmer Bob: 60 + 720 + 480 = 1260 gallons

Farmer Brenda:
Corn: 6 acres x 20 gallons/acre = 120 gallons
Cotton: 7 acres x 80 gallons/acre = 560 gallons
Beans: 14 acres x 40 gallons/acre = 560 gallons
Total water used by Farmer Brenda: 120 + 560 + 560 = 1240 gallons

Farmer Bernie:
Corn: 2 acres x 20 gallons/acre = 40 gallons
Cotton: 12 acres x 80 gallons/acre = 960 gallons
Total water used by Farmer Bernie: 40 + 960 = 1000 gallons

Now, let's calculate the total water used by all three farmers:

1260 (Farmer Bob) + 1240 (Farmer Brenda) + 1000 (Farmer Bernie) = 3500 gallons

To find the percentage of the total water used by Farmer Bob's farm, we can divide the total water used by Farmer Bob by the total water used by all three farmers and multiply by 100:

(1260 / 3500) x 100 = 36%

Answer: 36
