Let's start by using the information that Spaatz has 1 gemstone on her collar. Since Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones as Frankie, we can set up an equation:

Frankie's gemstones - 2 = Spaatz's gemstones
Frankie's gemstones - 2 = 1
Frankie's gemstones = 3

So Frankie has 3 gemstones on her collar.

Since Binkie has four times as many gemstones as Frankie, we can multiply Frankie's gemstones by 4:

Binkie's gemstones = Frankie's gemstones * 4
Binkie's gemstones = 3 * 4
Binkie's gemstones = 12

Answer: 12
