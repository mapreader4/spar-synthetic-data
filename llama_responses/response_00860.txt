Let's start by using the information that Earl owes Fred $28. So, Earl will have $90 - $28 = $62 after paying Fred. Then, Fred will have $48 - $28 = $20. Earl will give Fred $20, so Earl will have $62 - $20 = $42. Then, Fred will have $48 + $20 = $68. Earl will give Fred $68, so Earl will have $42 - $68 = $26. Greg owes Earl $40. Earl will give Greg $26, so Earl will have $42 - $26 = $16. Greg will give Earl $16, so Earl will have $42 - $16 = $26. Now, Earl and Greg will have $26 + $26 = $52. The answer is: Answer: 52
