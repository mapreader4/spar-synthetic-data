Let's start by identifying the number of people in the waiting room initially. There are 22 people in the waiting room. If three more people arrive, the number of people in the waiting room becomes five times the number of people inside the interview room. Let's represent this as an equation:

22 + 3 = 5x

To solve for the number of people in the interview room, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 1 to get:

22 + 3 = 5x

First, we can simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying both numbers by 1:

22 × 1 = 22
3 × 1 = 3

Then, we can equate the two expressions:

22 + 3 = 22 + 3

Since 22 + 3 = 25, there are 25 people in the interview room.
