Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Dina has 60 dolls.
* Ivy has twice as many dolls as Dina.
* 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions.

Now, let's use the information to find the number of collectors edition dolls Ivy has. If Ivy has twice as many dolls as Dina, that means Ivy has 60 * 2 = 120 dolls.

We know that 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions, so we can multiply 120 by 2/3 to find the number of collectors edition dolls Ivy has:

120 * 2/3 = 80

Answer: 80
