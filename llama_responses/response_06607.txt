Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of dogs that Carly worked on is x.

Since three of the dogs had only three legs, that means that the number of legs of all the dogs she worked on is 3x.

The total number of nails Carly trimmed is 164. Since each dog has 4 nails, the total number of nails on all the dogs is 4x. So, we can set up an equation:

4x = 164

We can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 164 รท 4
x = 41

So, Carly worked on 41 dogs.
