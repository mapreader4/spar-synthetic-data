Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of steps it takes Jake to get to the ground floor. Since the stairs have 30 steps across each floor, and there are 9 floors, the total number of steps is 9 x 30 = 270 steps.

Since Jake takes 3 steps every second, we can divide the total number of steps by 3 to find the number of seconds it takes him to get to the ground floor:

270 steps / 3 = 90 seconds

Since the elevator takes 1 minute to get to the ground floor, we can add the 90 seconds it takes Jake to get to the ground floor to the 1 minute the elevator takes:

90 seconds + 1 minute = 1 minute + 90 seconds = 2 minutes

So, Jake will get to the ground floor 2 minutes after Austin.
