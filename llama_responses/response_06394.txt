Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of balls, which is 100.

Nova inflated 40 balls that had holes and could not inflate. That leaves 100 - 40 = 60 balls that could potentially inflate.

Of those 60 balls, 20% were overinflated and exploded, which is 0.2 x 60 = 12. So, 60 - 12 = 48 balls were inflated successfully.

So, the number of balls that were inflated successfully and could be used is 48.

Answer: 48
