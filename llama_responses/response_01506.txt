Let's break it down step by step:

1. Tina had 24 brownies in total.
2. She had one with lunch and dinner every day for 5 days, so that's 10 brownies gone.
3. She had one with lunch for 5 days, so that's 5 brownies gone.
4. She and her husband had one for 5 days, so that's 5 brownies gone.
5. They shared 4 with dinner guests, so that's 4 brownies gone.
6. So, in total, 10 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 20 brownies are gone.
