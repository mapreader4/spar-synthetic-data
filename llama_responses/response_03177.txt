Let's break this down step by step!

On Wednesday, Vincent washed 6 loads of clothes.

On Thursday, he washed double the number of loads he did on Wednesday, which is 6 x 2 = 12 loads.

On Friday, he washed half the number of loads he did on Thursday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 loads.

On Saturday, he washed a third of the number of loads he did on Wednesday, which is 6 / 3 = 2 loads.

To find the total number of loads Vincent washed that week, I'll add up the loads from each day:

6 (Wednesday) + 12 (Thursday) + 6 (Friday) + 2 (Saturday) = 26

Answer: 26
