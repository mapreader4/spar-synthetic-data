Let x be the number of tickets purchased. The cost of each ticket is 7 dollars. The total cost is 7x. The discount is 50% of the cost. So, the discounted cost is 7x - (7x * 0.5). The total cost is 7x - 3.5x. So, Jorge spent 7x - 3.5x dollars. To solve for x, we add 3.5x to both sides of the equation. This is because we are trying to find the value of x. So, 7x - 3.5x + 3.5x = 24. 7x = 24 + 3.5x. 7x = 24 + 3.5x. 7x = 24 + 3.5x. 7x - 3.5x = 24. 7x = 24 + 3.5. x = 3.5. So, Jorge spent 7 * 3.5 dollars. The answer is 12.5.
