Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the number of clovers with 3 petals. 75% of 200 is 0.75 * 200 = 150. So, 150 clovers have 3 petals.

Step 2: Let's find the number of clovers with 2 petals. 24% of 200 is 0.24 * 200 = 48. So, 48 clovers have 2 petals.

Step 3: Let's find the number of clovers with 4 petals. 1% of 200 is 0.01 * 200 = 2. So, 2 clovers have 4 petals.

Step 4: To find the total number of cents June earns, we need to multiply the number of clovers with 3 petals by 1 cent, the number of clovers with 2 petals by 2 cents, and the number of clovers with 4 petals by 4 cents.

Answer: 150 * 1 = 150 cents, 48 * 2 = 96 cents, 2 * 4 = 8 cents. The total number of cents June earns is 150 + 96 + 8 = 254.
