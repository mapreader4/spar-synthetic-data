Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. Peggy skinned her knees, which means she used some bandages. The box of bandages had 8 less than 2 dozen, which means it had 24 - 8 = 16 bandages. After using 2 bandages on her left knee and 3 bandages on her right knee, Peggy used 2 + 3 = 5 bandages. This means she used 5 bandages. There are 16 - 5 = 11 bandages left in the box.
