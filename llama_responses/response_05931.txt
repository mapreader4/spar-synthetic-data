Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the distance from their house to the water park. Since Jake's dad can drive the distance in 30 minutes, we can find the distance in miles as follows:

30 minutes * 60 minutes per hour = 30/60 = 0.5 hours
0.5 hours * 60 miles per hour = 30 miles

Now, Jake's dad drives half of this distance at 28 miles per hour. So, half of 30 miles is 15 miles. It will take him 15/28 = 0.536 hours to drive this part of the journey.

The other half of the distance is 30 - 15 = 15 miles. It will take him 15/60 = 0.25 hours to drive this part of the journey.

The total time it takes him to drive to the water park is 0.536 hours + 0.25 hours = 0.76 hours.

Now, Jake can bike 11 miles per hour. To find the time it will take him to bike to the water park, we need to divide the distance by his speed:

30 miles / 11 miles per hour = 2.727 hours

So, the answer is:
