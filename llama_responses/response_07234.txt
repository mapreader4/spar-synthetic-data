Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of dominoes that each player will receive. We know that there are 28 dominoes in the set, and there are 4 players (Jean and her 3 friends). To find the number of dominoes each player will receive, we need to divide the total number of dominoes by the number of players.

To do this, we can divide 28 by 4, which gives us:

28 รท 4 = 7

So, each player will receive 7 dominoes.

Answer: 7
