Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cheerleaders who need a size 6. We know that half of 19 is 9.5, but since we can't order half of a number of whole people, we round down to the nearest whole number, so we'll round down to 9.

So, 9 cheerleaders need a size 6.
