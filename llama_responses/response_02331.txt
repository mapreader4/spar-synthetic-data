Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how much time Henri has left after watching the movies.

Henri watches 3.5 hours on the first movie and 1.5 hours on the second movie. So, he has watched a total of 3.5 + 1.5 = 5 hours.

He has 8 hours to watch movies and read. So, he has 8 - 5 = 3 hours left.

Now, he wants to read. If he can read 10 words a minute, he can read 3 * 60 = 180 words in an hour. Since he has 3 hours left, he can read 3 * 180 = 540 words.

Answer: 540
