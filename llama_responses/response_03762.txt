Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Mark has x parking tickets. Since Mark has twice as many parking tickets as Sarah, and Sarah has 6 speeding tickets, we can set up an equation to represent the number of parking tickets Mark has:

x = 2x

Since Sarah has 6 speeding tickets, we know that x must be equal to 3, because 2x = 2 * 3 = 6. So, Mark has 6 parking tickets.

Answer: 6
