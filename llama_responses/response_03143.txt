Let's break it down step by step.

Amy has 5 chocolate bars. She has 7 times as many M&Ms as chocolate bars, which is 5 x 7 = 35 M&Ms. She also has 6 times as many marshmallows as M&Ms, which is 35 x 6 = 210 marshmallows.

In total, Amy has 5 + 35 + 210 = 250 candies.

Amy wants to put each basket with 10 candies. To find out how many baskets she can fill, we can divide the total number of candies by 10.

250 รท 10 = 25

Answer: 25
