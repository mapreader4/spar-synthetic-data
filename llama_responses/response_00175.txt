Let's break down the problem step by step.

Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, so the proportion of time spent on flat sand is 1/3.

On flat sand, the speed is 60 miles per hour.

Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on uphill slopes, so the proportion of time spent on uphill slopes is also 1/3.

On uphill slopes, the speed is 18 miles per hour slower than on flat sand, which means the speed is 60 - 18 = 42 miles per hour.

Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on downhill slopes, so the proportion of time spent on downhill slopes is also 1/3.

On downhill slopes, the speed is 12 miles per hour faster than on flat sand, which means the speed is 60 + 12 = 72 miles per hour.

To find the average speed, we need to multiply the proportion of time spent on each terrain by the speed on that terrain and then add up the results.

Time spent on flat sand: 1/3
Speed on flat sand: 60 miles per hour
Time spent on uphill slopes: 1/3
Speed on uphill slopes: 42 miles per hour
Time spent on downhill slopes: 1/3
Speed on downhill slopes: 72 miles per hour

Now, let's calculate the average speed:

(1/3) x 60 + (1/3) x 42 + (1/3) x 72 = 20 + 14 + 24 = 58

Answer: 58
