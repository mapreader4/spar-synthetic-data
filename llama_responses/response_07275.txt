Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say John bought x Slurpees. Then, he paid $20 and got $8 back in change. The cost of each Slurpee is $2.

The cost of x Slurpees is $2x. The total cost is $20. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

2x = 20 - 8

We can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:

2x = 12

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

Answer: 6
