Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Team A scored 8 points in the first half.
* Team B scored half as many points as Team A in the first half. So, Team B scored 8/2 = 4 points in the first half.
* In the second half, Team B scored as many points as Team A in the first half, which is 8 points.
* Team A scored 2 goals less than Team B in the second half. So, Team A scored 8 - 2 = 6 points in the second half.

Now, let's add the points scored by both teams in the first half and the second half:

* First half: Team A scored 8 points, and Team B scored 4 points. So, the total points scored in the first half is 8 + 4 = 12 points.
* Second half: Team A scored 6 points, and Team B scored 8 points. So, the total points scored in the second half is 6 + 8 = 14 points.

To find the total points scored by both teams during the whole match, we add the points from both halves:

12 (first half) + 14 (second half) = 26 points.

Answer: 26
