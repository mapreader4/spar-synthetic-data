Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the total amount of water that flows into the tank during the 90 minutes.

Since the water flows in at a rate of 2 L/min, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total amount of water that flows in during the 90 minutes is:

2 L/min x 90 minutes = 180 L

Step 2: Add this to the initial 100 L of rainwater in the tank.

Initial amount of rainwater in the tank = 100 L
Total amount of water that flows in during the 90 minutes = 180 L

Total amount of rainwater in the tank at the end of the heavy rain = 100 L + 180 L = 280 L

Answer: 280
