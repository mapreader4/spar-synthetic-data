Let's think step by step!

Theon's ship can move 15 nautical miles per hour, so it will take Theon's ship:

Time = Distance / Speed = Time = 90 nautical miles / 15 nautical miles per hour = 6 hours

Yara's ship can move 30 nautical miles per hour, so it will take Yara's ship:

Time = Distance / Speed = Time = 90 nautical miles / 30 nautical miles per hour = 3 hours

Since Yara's ship will be moving 3 hours before Theon's ship, Yara will be 3 hours ahead of Theon.
