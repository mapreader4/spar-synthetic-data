Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the length of the pole is x meters.

The pole is 30% shorter than its original length. This means that 30% of the pole was cut off. So, 30% of x is equal to 0.3x.

The equation to solve for x is 0.3x = x - 20.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the decimal. This gives us:

0.3x * 100 = x - 20 * 100

This simplifies to:

30x = 200 - 20

To solve for x, we can subtract 200 from both sides of the equation. This gives us:

x = 180

Answer: 180
