Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's let E be the number of votes Eliot got. 

The problem states that Eliot got twice as many votes as Shaun. So, if we let S be the number of votes Shaun got, we can write the equation E = 2S.

The problem also states that Shaun got 5 times as many votes as Randy. So, Randy got 16 votes, so Shaun got 16/5 = 3 votes. 

So, we can write the equation S = 3.

Now, we can substitute the value of S into the equation E = 2S to get the number of votes Eliot got:

E = 2 * 3 = 6

Answer: 6
