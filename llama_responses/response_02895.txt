To solve this problem, I will break it down step by step.

First, I will calculate the total time spent driving, which is the total distance divided by the speed:

Total distance = 480 miles
Speed = 60 mph

Total time spent driving = Total distance / Speed = 480 miles / 60 mph = 8 hours

Next, I will add the time spent on breaks:

Time spent driving = 8 hours
Time spent on lunch break = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
Time spent on bathroom breaks = 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours

Total time taken = Time spent driving + Time spent on lunch break + Time spent on bathroom breaks = 8 hours + 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 9 hours

So, the total time taken for the trip is 9 hours.

Answer: 9
