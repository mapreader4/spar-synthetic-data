Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

1. Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari.
2. Mari made 8 buttons.
3. Sue made half as many as Kendra.

From the first statement, we know that Kendra made 5 times as many buttons as Mari. This means Kendra made 5x = 5(1) = 5 buttons. And Kendra made 4 more than 5 buttons, so Kendra made 9 buttons.

From the third statement, we know that Sue made half as many as Kendra. Since Kendra made 9 buttons, Sue made 9/2 = 4.5 buttons.

However, since Sue made an integer number of buttons, we round down 4.5 to 4.

Answer: 4
