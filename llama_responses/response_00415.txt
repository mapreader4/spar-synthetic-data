Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the puppy's initial weight, which is 6 pounds at 7 weeks old.

At 9 weeks old, the puppy doubled in weight, so its weight is 6 * 2 = 12 pounds.

At 3 months old, the puppy doubled in weight again, so its weight is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds.

At 5 months old, the puppy doubled in weight again, so its weight is 24 * 2 = 48 pounds.

Finally, by the time the dog is one year old, it added 30 pounds to its weight, so its final weight is 48 + 30 = 78 pounds.

Answer: 78
