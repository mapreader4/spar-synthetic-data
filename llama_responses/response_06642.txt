Let's break it down step by step.

Larry started with 150 channels.

He lost 20 channels and gained 12 channels, so now he has 150 - 20 + 12 = 142 channels.

He then asked to reduce his package by 10 channels, so he has 142 - 10 = 132 channels.

He added the sports package, which is 8 channels, so he has 132 + 8 = 140 channels.

He realizes that he didn't add the supreme sports package, so he adds it, which adds 7 more channels. So, he has 140 + 7 = 147 channels.

Answer: 147
