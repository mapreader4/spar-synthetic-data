Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the number of hot dogs Guise ate on Monday. He ate 10 hot dogs on Monday. Then, we know that he ate 2 more hot dogs each day than the previous day. This means that on Tuesday, he ate 12 hot dogs. On Wednesday, he ate 14 hot dogs, which is 2 more than the 12 he ate the day before.

So, by Wednesday, Guise had eaten 10 + 2 + 2 = 14 hot dogs.
