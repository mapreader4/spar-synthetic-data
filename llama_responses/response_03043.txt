Let's break this problem down step by step.

Mark started with 14 buttons.

Shane gave him 3 times that amount of buttons, which means Mark got 14 * 3 = 42 buttons.

Then, Sam asked for half of Mark's buttons. So, we need to find half of 42.

Half of 42 is 42 / 2 = 21.

So, after giving away 21 buttons to Sam, Mark would have 14 + 21 = 35 buttons left.

Answer: 35
