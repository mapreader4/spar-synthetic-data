Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of people on the bus. We know that the total number of boys is 50.

The problem states that Mr. Gordon has taken 2/5 times more girls than boys, so the number of girls is 2/5 * 50 = 20. Therefore, the total number of girls is 20.

The bus has a driver and an assistant, so the total number of people on the bus is the number of boys, the number of girls, the driver, and the assistant. This is 50 + 20 + 2 = 72.

However, the teacher also drives with the students, so we need to add the teacher to the total count. The total number of people on the bus is 72 + 1 = 73.

Answer: 73
