Let's start by identifying the total cost of the items Jerry needs to buy. 

Jerry needs 2 liters of mustard oil that costs $13 per liter, so the total cost of the oil is 2 x $13 = $26. He also needs 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta that costs $4 per pound, so the total cost of the pasta is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, he needs 1 pound of pasta sauce that costs $5, so the total cost of the sauce is $5. 

The total cost of the items is 26 + 12 + 5 = $43. 

Jerry can keep the rest of the $50 after grocery shopping. Since the total cost of the items is $43, Jerry will have $50 - $43 = $7 left.
