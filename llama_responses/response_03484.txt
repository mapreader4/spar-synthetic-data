Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the least common multiple of 2, 3, and 4, which is the least common multiple of the three numbers.

Step 2: Since 12 is the least common multiple of 2, 3, and 4, we can conclude that the bulbs will be on at the same time after 12 seconds.
