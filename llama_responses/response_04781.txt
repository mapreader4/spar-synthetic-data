Let's break it down step by step.

Joseph drives at 50 mph for 2.5 hours. So, Joseph drives a total distance of:

50 mph * 2.5 hours = 50 * 2.5 = 125 miles

Kyle drives at 62 mph for 2 hours. So, Kyle drives a total distance of:

62 mph * 2 = 124 miles

To find the difference in distance driven, we subtract Kyle's distance from Joseph's distance:

125 - 124 = 1
