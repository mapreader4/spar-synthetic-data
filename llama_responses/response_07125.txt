Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of money Pete has in his wallet.

Pete has 2 $20 bills, which is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars. He has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x 10 = 40 dollars. Adding these together, he has a total of 40 + 40 = 80 dollars.

Now, Pete has 90 dollars he needs to pay. Since he needs 90 - 80 = 10 dollars more. He has 10 dollars, which is 10/0.5 = 20 bottles. He needs 10 more bottles.

Answer: 20
