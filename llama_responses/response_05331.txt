Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the pencil. A pencil costs $2.

Now, a pen costs $9 more than a pencil. So, a pen costs $9 + 2 = $11.

To find the total cost of both items, we need to add the cost of the pencil and the cost of the pen. The total cost is:

$2 + $11 = $13.
