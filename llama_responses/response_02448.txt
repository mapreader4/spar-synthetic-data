Let's break this down step by step.

1. Each box contains 10 boxes, each containing 50 bottles of water.
2. Each bottle has a capacity of 12 liters and is filled up to 3/4 of its capacity. So, each bottle contains 3/4 * 12 = 9 liters of water.
3. Since there are 50 bottles per box, the total capacity of water in each box is 50 * 9 = 450 liters.
4. Since there are 10 boxes, the total capacity of water in all the boxes is 450 * 10 = 4500 liters.

Answer: 4500
