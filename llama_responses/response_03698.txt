Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us.

* Kenia has three times as many rats as Hunter and Elodie have together.
* Elodie has 30 rats.
* Elodie has 10 rats more than Hunter.

Let's represent the number of rats Hunter has as x. So, we know that Elodie has x + 10 rats.

We know that Kenia has three times as many rats as Hunter and Elodie have together. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 30 + 10

We can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get:

3x = 20

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 20 / 3

x = 6.67

So, the number of rats Hunter has is 6.

Answer: 6
