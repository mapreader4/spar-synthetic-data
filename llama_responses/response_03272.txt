Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of water used by the old toilet in June.

The toilet uses 5 gallons of water per flush and John flushed it 15 times a day, so the total amount of water used is:

5 gallons per flush * 15 flushes per day = 5 * 15 = 75 gallons

Now, John replaced the toilet with one that uses 80% less water per flush. 80% less water is equal to 5 * (1 - 0.8) = 1 gallon. So, the new toilet uses 1 gallon of water per flush.

John's new toilet uses 1 gallon per flush and he flushed it 15 times a day, so the total amount of water used by the new toilet is:

1 gallon per flush * 15 flushes per day = 1 * 15 = 15 gallons

Now, to find out how much water John saved, we subtract the total amount of water used by the new toilet from the total amount used by the old toilet:

75 gallons (old toilet) - 15 gallons (new toilet) = 60 gallons

So, John saved 60 gallons of water in June.
