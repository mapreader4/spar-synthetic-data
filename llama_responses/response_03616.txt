Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of countries Cornelia visited: 42.

She visited 20 countries in Europe and 10 in South America. So, the total number of countries in these two continents is 20 + 10 = 30.

The remaining countries are the ones in Asia, and half of them were visited. So, the number of Asian countries visited is half of 30, which is 15.

So, the answer is: Answer: 15.
