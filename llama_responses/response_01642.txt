To find the total number of words, we need to find the total number of words in each essay and add them together.

Madeline's essay has 150 words.
Johnny's essay is double in length, so it also has 150 words.
Timothy's essay has 30 words more than Madeline's, so it has 180 words.

To find the total number of words, we add the number of words in each essay together:

150 + 150 + 180 = 380

So, the total number of words is 380.

Answer: 380
