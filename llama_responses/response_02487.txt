Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the flour: 3 boxes of flour at $3 each is 3 x $3 = $9.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the eggs: 3 trays of eggs at $10 each is 3 x $10 = $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the milk: 7 liters of milk at $5 each liter is 7 x $5 = $35.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the baking soda: 2 boxes of baking soda at $3 each is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $9 + $30 + $35 + $6 = $80.

Answer: 80
