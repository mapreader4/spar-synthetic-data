Let's break down the process step by step:

1. Making the batter: Let's assume this takes some time, but it's not specified. Let's assume it takes 10 minutes.
2. Baking the cookies: 15 minutes
3. Allowing the cookies to cool: 30 minutes
4. Dipping the cookies in white icing: Let's assume this takes 5 minutes.
5. Allowing the icing to harden: 30 minutes
6. Re-dipping the cookies in chocolate icing: 5 minutes
7. Allowing the icing to harden again: 30 minutes

So, the total time taken for the process is:

10 (making the batter) + 15 (baking) + 30 (cooling) + 5 (dipping in white icing) + 30 (allowing icing to harden) + 5 (re-dipping in chocolate icing) + 30 (allowing icing to harden again) = 120 minutes

To make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them, it takes 120 minutes.
