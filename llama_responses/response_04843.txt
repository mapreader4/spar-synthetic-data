Let's break down the information given:

- Josh has soccer practice on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
- He has band practice on Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.

From Monday to Friday, we need to find the total hours spent on extracurricular activities.

Let's add the hours for soccer practice: 2 days (Monday and Friday) * 2 hours per day = 4 hours
And the hours for band practice: 2 days (Tuesday and Thursday) * 1.5 hours per day = 3 hours

Adding the hours, we get: 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Answer: 7
