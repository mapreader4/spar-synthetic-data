Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the lemons. The price of lemons increased by $4, so the new price of lemons is $8 + 4 = $12. Erick had 80 lemons, so he would get 80 x $12 = $960.

Next, let's look at the grapes. The price of grapes increased by half the price that the price of lemons increased by, which means the price of grapes increased by (1/2) x 4 = 2. So, the new price of grapes is $7 + 2 = $9. Erick had 140 grapes, so he would get 140 x $9 = $1260.

Now, let's add the money he would get from selling the lemons and grapes. $960 + $1260 = $2220.

Answer: 2220
