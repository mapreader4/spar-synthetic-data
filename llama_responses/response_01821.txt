Let's break this problem down step by step.

There are 24 students in the class. 1/3 of them had their portraits taken before lunch, so that is 8 students.

Then, 10 more students had their portraits taken after lunch, so that is 18 students.

So, the number of students who had their portraits taken is 8 + 10 = 18.

To find the number of students who have not yet had their portraits taken, we subtract the 18 students who have had their portraits taken from the total 24 students. This gives us:

24 - 18 = 6.

Answer: 6
