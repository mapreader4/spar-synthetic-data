Let's break down the given information:

Jack has already sold 4 brownies for $3 each, which is a total of 4 x 3 = $12. He has also sold 5 lemon squares for $2 each, which is a total of 5 x 2 = $10. So, he has made a total of 12 + 10 = $22 so far.

His goal is to make $50. To find out how many more he needs to make, we subtract the amount he's made so far from his goal: $50 - $22 = $28.

Since he sells cookies for $4 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the price of each cookie to find out how many cookies he needs to sell:

$28 รท 4 = 7.

Answer: 7
