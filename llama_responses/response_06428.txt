Let's break this down step by step.

Percy swims 1 hour before school and 1 hour after school 5 days a week. That means he swims 1 + 1 = 2 hours a day. So, in a week, he swims 2 hours a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he swims 2 * 7 = 14 hours a week.

He swims 3 hours on the weekend. This is an additional 3 hours.

So, the total number of hours he swims is 14 + 3 = 17.

Answer: 17
