Let's break this down step by step:

1. Bob started with $80.

2. On Monday, he spent half the money, so he spent $40.

3. On Tuesday, he spent one-fifth of the amount left, which is $40, so he has $40 left.

4. On Wednesday, he spent 3/8ths of the amount left, which is $40, so he has $40 - $12 = $28 left.

Answer: 28
