To find the total time spent on commercials, we need to find one-fourth of the total time of the 6 programs. To find the total time, we need to multiply the total number of programs by 30 minutes. 

Total time of programs = 6 x 30 = 180 minutes

Then, one-fourth of the total time is spent on commercials. 

Total time on commercials = 180 / 4 = 45 minutes

Answer: 45
