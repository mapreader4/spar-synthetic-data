Let's break down the problem step by step.

Noah sells large paintings for $60 each, so the total amount of money he earned from selling large paintings is 8 x 60 = 480 dollars.

He sells small paintings for $30 each, so the total amount of money he earned from selling small paintings is 4 x 30 = 120 dollars.

So, the total amount of money he earned in total is 480 + 120 = 600 dollars.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 600
