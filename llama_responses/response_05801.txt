Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's start by finding the total number of animals Aubree saw initially. There were 20 beavers and 40 chipmunks, so the total number of animals is 20 + 40 = 60.

Then, when Aubree came back from school, she realized that the number of beavers had doubled. So, the number of beavers increased by a factor of 2. 20 x 2 = 40 beavers.

The number of chipmunks, however, decreased by 10. So, the number of chipmunks is 40 - 10 = 30.

Now, let's find the total number of animals Aubree saw that day. 40 beavers + 30 chipmunks = 70.

Answer: 70
