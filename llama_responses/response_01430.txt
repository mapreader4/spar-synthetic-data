Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by adding the number of girls and boys to get the total number of children: 14 girls + 11 boys = 25 children.

Since each playgroup has 25 people, we know that the number of people in each group is 25. To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of people by 25, which is 25, into 25.

So, we can divide 25 children into 25 groups. To do this, we can do 25 รท 25 = 1.

Since there are 1 group of 25 people, and we know that each group has 25 people, we know that each group has 25 people. Since there are 1 group of 25 people, we know that there are 25 people in that group.

Now, let's find the number of parents. Since each group has 25 people, and there are 25 people in that group, we know that the number of parents is 25.

Answer: 25
