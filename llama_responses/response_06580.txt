Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of gallons the pool can hold.

The pool can hold 50 gallons of water.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours it takes to fill the pool.

It takes 50 hours to fill the pool.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of gallons per hour.

The hose runs at 100 gallons per hour.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of water.

It costs 1 cent for 10 gallons. To find the cost per gallon, we can divide 1 cent by 10 gallons to get 0.1 cents per gallon.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of water for the pool.

We need to multiply the total number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

50 gallons * 0.1 cents per gallon = 5 dollars

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of water for the pool.

It costs 5 dollars to fill the pool.
