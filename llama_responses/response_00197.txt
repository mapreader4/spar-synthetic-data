Let's break this problem down step by step.

There are 16 people at the dinner party.

Half of 16 is 8, so 8 people eat 1 1/2 rolls each. That's 8 x 1/2 = 4 rolls.

The other half of the people, which is also 8, eat 1/2 a roll each. That's 8 x 1/2 = 4 rolls.

So, the total number of rolls eaten is 4 + 4 = 8.

To find the number of rolls leftover, we need to subtract the total number of rolls eaten from the total number of rolls available.

The total number of rolls available is 40. The total number of rolls eaten is 8. So, the number of rolls leftover is 40 - 8 = 32.

Answer: 32
