Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Will catches 16 catfish and 10 eels. So, the total number of fish Will has is 16 + 10 = 26.
2. Henry catches 3 trout for every catfish Will catches, so Henry catches 3 * 16 = 48 trout.
3. Henry decides to return half his catch, which is 48 / 2 = 24 trout. So, Henry returns 24 trout.
4. Now, we need to add the fish that Will and Henry have. Will has 26 fish, and Henry has 24 - 24 = 2 trout. So, they have 26 + 2 = 28 fish altogether.

Answer: 28
