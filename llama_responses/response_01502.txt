Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of people in the class: 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid. That makes a total of 29 people.

Dani brings 2 and a half dozen cupcakes, which is equivalent to 13 cupcakes. She gives one cupcake to each of the 29 people, which means she gives away 29 cupcakes.

However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract those 3 students from the total number of people. That leaves 26 people remaining.

Now, we need to divide the 13 cupcakes among the 26 people. To do this, we can divide 13 by 26, which gives us 0.5 cupcakes per person.

Since we can't give a fraction of a cupcake, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, that would be 0 cupcakes per person. Since each person gets 0 cupcakes, that means Dani has 0 cupcakes left over.

Answer: 0
