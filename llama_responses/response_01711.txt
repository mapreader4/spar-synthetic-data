Let's break this down step by step.

First, the admission price for an adult is $30. Since there are 6 adults (10 people - 4 children), the total admission price for the adults is 6 x $30 = $180.

The admission price for a child is half the price of an adult, which is $15. Since there are 4 children, the total admission price for the children is 4 x $15 = $60.

The total admission price for the group is the sum of the adult and child admission prices: $180 + $60 = $240.

Now, since the group buys a soda, they can get 20% off the total admission price. To find the discount, multiply the total admission price by 20% (which is the same as multiplying by 0.20): $240 x 0.20 = $48.

The discount is $48, so the group's new total admission price is the original total admission price minus the discount: $240 - $48 = $192.

Finally, Janet pays the new total admission price plus the cost of the soda: $192 + $5 = $197.

Answer: 197
