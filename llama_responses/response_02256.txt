Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total time spent waiting for the roller coaster and tilt-a-whirl. The wait for the roller coaster is 30 minutes, and the wait for the tilt-a-whirl is 60 minutes. So, the total wait time is 30 + 60 = 90 minutes.

Since Carson rides the roller coaster 4 times, that is 4 * 30 = 120 minutes. The total time spent on the roller coaster is 120 minutes.

The total time spent waiting for the rides is 90 + 120 = 210 minutes. Now, let's subtract the time spent waiting for the rides from the total time spent at the carnival, which is 240 minutes (4 hours).

The time spent riding the giant slide is 240 - 210 = 30 minutes.

So, Carson can ride the giant slide 30/15 = 2 times.
