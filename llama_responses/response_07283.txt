Let's break this problem down step by step.

The farmer plants 8 seedlings in a row for the beans. To find out how many rows he needs, we need to divide the total number of seedlings by the number of seedlings per row. 

64 seedlings / 8 seedlings per row = 8 rows

The farmer also plants 7 seeds in a row for the pumpkins. To find out how many rows he needs, we need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per row.

84 seeds / 7 seeds per row = 12 rows

The farmer also plants 6 radishes in a row for the radishes. To find out how many rows he needs, we need to divide the total number of radishes by the number of radishes per row.

48 radishes / 6 radishes per row = 8 rows

The farmer plants two rows per plant bed, so we need to add the number of rows for each type of plant together and divide by 2.

8 rows (beans) + 12 rows (pumpkins) + 8 rows (radishes) = 28 rows

28 rows / 2 = 14 plant beds

Answer: 14
