Let's break it down step by step:

1. Stefan had 16 more seashells than Vail, so Stefan had 16 + 1 = 17 seashells.
2. Vail had 5 less seashells than Aiguo, so Vail had Aiguo - 5 = 15 seashells.
3. Aiguo had 20 seashells.
4. The total number of seashells is the sum of the number of seashells each child had: 17 + 15 + 20 = 52.

Answer: 52
