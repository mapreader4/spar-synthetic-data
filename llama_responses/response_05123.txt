Let's start by calculating the total cost of the items Olivia bought.

Olivia bought 2 packs of basketball cards for $3 each. 2 x 3 = 6

Olivia bought 5 decks of baseball cards for $4 each. 5 x 4 = 20

The total cost of the items Olivia bought is 6 + 20 = 26

Olivia had a $50 bill. To find out how much change she received, we need to subtract the total cost from the $50 bill.

50 - 26 = 24

Answer: 24
