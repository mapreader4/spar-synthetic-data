Let's break this down step by step!

Lydia has 60 liters of fuel in total.

For the second third of the trip, she will need a third of all her fuel, which is:

60 liters / 3 = 20 liters

For the final third of the trip, she will need half of the amount she needs for the second third, which is:

20 liters / 2 = 10 liters

Now, let's add up the amount of fuel she will need for the second and third thirds:

20 liters + 10 liters = 30 liters

This means that Lydia will need a total of 30 liters of fuel for the second and third thirds of the trip.

To find out how much fuel she can use in the first third of the trip, we subtract the amount she will need for the second and third thirds from her total fuel:

60 liters - 30 liters = 30 liters

Wait, this can't be right! We can't use a negative amount of fuel. This means that Lydia must have already used some fuel in the first third of the trip.

Let's call the amount of fuel she uses in the first third x. Then, the amount of fuel she has left for the second and third thirds is:

60 liters - x

We know that the amount of fuel she needs for the second and third thirds is 30 liters, so we can set up the equation:

30 liters = (60 liters - x) / 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 liters = 60 liters - x

Subtracting 60 liters from both sides gives:

30 liters = x

So, Lydia can use 30 liters of fuel in the first third of the trip.
