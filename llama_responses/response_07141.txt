Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how long it takes Ann to frost a single cake with her sprained wrist. If it takes her 8 minutes to frost a cake with her sprained wrist, then it takes her 8 minutes to frost a cake normally. So, we can assume that it takes her 5 minutes to frost a cake normally, since normally it takes her 5 minutes to frost a cake.

Now, to find out how long it would take her to frost 10 cakes, we need to multiply the time it takes to frost a cake by 10. So, we multiply 5 minutes by 10, which is equal to 50 minutes.

Answer: 50
