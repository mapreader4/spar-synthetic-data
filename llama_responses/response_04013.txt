Let's break down the given information step by step.

Kate saved $27 in March. She saved $13 in April and $28 in May. So, the total amount Kate saved in March, April, and May is $27 + $13 + $28 = $48.

Then, Kate spent $49 on a keyboard and $5 on a mouse. So, she spent a total of $49 + $5 = $54.

To find out how much money Kate has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she saved. So, Kate has $48 - $54 = $4 left.
