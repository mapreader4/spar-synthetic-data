Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* John has a raw squat of 600 pounds without sleeves or wraps.
* Sleeves add 30 pounds to his lift.
* Wraps add 25% to his squat.

First, let's find the weight of John's squat with sleeves:

600 pounds (raw squat) + 30 pounds (sleeves) = 630 pounds

Now, let's find the weight of John's squat with wraps:

600 pounds (raw squat) + 25% (25/100) * 600 pounds = 600 pounds + 150 pounds = 750 pounds

Now, let's find the difference in pounds between the weight of John's squat with wraps and the weight of his squat with sleeves:

750 pounds (with wraps) - 630 pounds (with sleeves) = 120 pounds

So, John gets 120 pounds more from wraps compared to sleeves.
