Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* The cost of small glasses is $3 each.
* The cost of large glasses is $5 each.
* Peter has $50 in total.
* Peter has $1 left after buying 8 small glasses, which cost $3 each.

Let's calculate the total cost of the 8 small glasses:

8 small glasses x $3 each = 8 x 3 = $24

Peter has $50 - $24 = $26 left.

Since Peter has $26 left, and large glasses cost $5 each, we can calculate the number of large glasses he can buy:

$26 รท $5 = 26 รท 5 = 5.2

So, Peter can buy 5 large glasses with the remaining $26.

Answer: 5
