Let's break it down step by step.

Lindsey saved $50 in September, so she has $50.
She saved $37 in October, so now she has $50 + $37 = $87.
She saved $11 in November, so now she has $87 + $11 = $98.

Then her mom said she would give her $25, so now she has $98 - $25 = $73.

Then she spent $87 on a video game. So, she had $73 - $87 = $- $14.

So, Lindsey has $-14.

Answer: -14
