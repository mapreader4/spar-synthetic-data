Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. The car traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. So, we know that the rate of speed is 180 miles per 4 hours.

2. If the car travels at the same rate, it will travel the same distance in the next 3 hours.

3. The rate of speed is 180 miles per 4 hours, so the rate of speed is 180/4 = 45 miles per hour.

4. To find the distance traveled in the next 3 hours, we can multiply the rate of speed by the time: 45 mph * 3 hours = 135 miles.

5. So, the car will travel 135 miles in the next 3 hours.

Answer: 135
