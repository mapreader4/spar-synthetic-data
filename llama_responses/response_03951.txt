Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Kelsey turned 25 in 1999.
* Her older sister was born 3 years before Kelsey.
* It's currently 2021.

We can start by finding the year Kelsey's older sister was born. Since Kelsey turned 25 in 1999, we can subtract 25 from 1999 to find the year her older sister was born:

1999 - 25 = 1974

So, Kelsey's older sister was born in 1974.

Now, we need to find the difference in years between 1974 and 2021. We can subtract 1974 from 2021 to find the answer:

2021 - 1974 = 47

Answer: 47
