Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that John got $40 in change.

Let x be the cost of each barbell. Then, we know that the total cost of the 3 barbells is 3x.

We know that John gave $850 to the barbell store and got $40 back, so the total cost of the 3 barbells is $850 - $40, or $810.

So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 810.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3: x = 810 รท 3 = 270.

Answer: 270
