Let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 2 puzzles, each with 2000 pieces. So, in total, he has 4000 pieces to complete.
2. He can complete 100 pieces every 10 minutes. So, the total time it will take him to complete 1 puzzle is 10 minutes.
3. To complete 4000 pieces, he will need 40 sets of 100 pieces. 40 sets of 100 pieces will take him 400 minutes.
4. So, the total time it will take James to complete both puzzles is 400 minutes.
