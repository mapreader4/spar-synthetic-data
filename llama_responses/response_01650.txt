Let's solve this problem step by step. Let's say Sarah took x cookies. If there were 150 cookies and 14 of her 15 neighbors took 10 cookies each, then 14 * 10 = 140 cookies were taken. This leaves 150 - 140 = 10 cookies left for Sarah. But we know that only 8 cookies were left. So, Sarah took 150 - 8 = 142 cookies. But the question asks how many cookies Sarah took, so we need to subtract 10 cookies from 142 cookies. 142 - 10 = 132. So, Sarah took 132 cookies.
