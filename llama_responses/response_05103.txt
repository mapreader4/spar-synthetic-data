Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the 2nd competitor. They ate twice the amount of hot dogs as the 1st competitor, so they ate 2 x 12 = 24 hot dogs.

The 3rd competitor ate 25% less than the 2nd competitor, so they ate 24 - 0.25 * 24 = 18 hot dogs.

So, the 3rd competitor ate 18 hot dogs.

Answer: 18
