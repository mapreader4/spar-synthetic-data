Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The room is 8 feet tall, and the curtains need to pool at the bottom. This means we need to add 5 inches to the length of the curtains to ensure they pool at the bottom.
2. To find the length of the curtains, we need to convert the height of the room from feet to inches. 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so we multiply the height of the room by 12 to get the height in inches: 8 feet * 12 inches = 96 inches.
3. Now, we add the 5 inches to the length of the curtains to ensure they pool at the bottom: 96 inches + 5 inches = 101 inches.
4. Therefore, the curtains need to be 101 inches long to pool at the bottom.

Answer: 101
