Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's find the number of batches Jack makes in 24 days.

Since he makes 1.5 gallons in each batch, and there are 96 ounces in 1 gallon, the number of batches is:

96 / 1.5 = 64

Jack makes 64 batches of coffee in 24 days.

2. Now, let's find the number of hours Jack spends making coffee in 24 days.

Jack spends 20 hours to make each batch, and he makes 64 batches in 24 days.  So, the number of hours is:

64 * 20 = 1280

Jack spends 1280 hours making coffee in 24 days.

Answer: 1280
