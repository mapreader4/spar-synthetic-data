Let's break this down step by step:

1. James has $250,000 in his account at the start of the year.
2. He invests $2000 a week into his account. So, he adds $2000 to his initial $250,000. $250,000 + $2000 = $252,000.
3. At the end of the year, he gets a windfall worth 50% more than what he has in his bank account. So, we need to find 50% of $252,000. 50% of $252,000 is $126,000.
4. Now, we add the windfall to his current balance. $252,000 + $126,000 = $378,000.

Answer: 378,000
