Let's break it down step by step.

Marie has 4 notebooks with 20 stamps each, so she has a total of 4 * 20 = 80 stamps. She also has 2 binders with 50 stamps each, so she has a total of 2 * 50 = 100 stamps.

If she decides to keep 1/4 of the stamps, she will keep 1/4 of the total stamps, which is 1/4 * 80 + 1/4 * 100 = 30. So, she can give away the remaining stamps, which is 80 - 30 = 50. Answer: 50.
