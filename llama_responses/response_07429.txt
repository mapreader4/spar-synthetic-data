Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the number of students who were present last Monday. We know that two-sevenths of the students were absent, so we can find the number of students present by subtracting the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Let's denote the total number of students as S. We know that two-sevenths of them were absent, so we can set up the equation as follows:

S - 2/7S = number of students present

We can solve for the number of students present by multiplying both sides of the equation by 7:

(7/2)S = 28 - 2

7S = 28 - 2

S = 4

So, the number of students present last Monday was 4.
