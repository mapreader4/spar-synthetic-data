Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first determine how many years old his brother is. Since his brother is 20 years old, we know that 20 - 11 = 9 years younger than him. So, Trevor's brother is 9 years older than him.

Now, we know that Trevor will be older than his brother when his brother is three times as old as Trevor is now. So, we have to multiply 9 by 3, which gives us 27.

So, Trevor will be 11 + 27 = 38 years old when his older brother is three times as old as Trevor is now.
