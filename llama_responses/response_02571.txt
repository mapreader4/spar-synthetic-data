To solve this problem, I will think step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Eric has a chicken farm with 4 chickens. His chickens lay 3 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs laid per day is 3 eggs.

The problem asks us to find out how many eggs Eric will have collected after 3 days. To do this, we need to multiply the number of eggs laid per day by the number of days.

The number of eggs laid per day is 3, and the number of days is 3. So, we multiply 3 * 3 to get the total number of eggs collected.

3 * 3 = 9

Answer: 9
