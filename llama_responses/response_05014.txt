Let's start by calculating the total time it will take to paint each type of flower:

* Lilies: 17 x 5 minutes = 85 minutes
* Roses: 10 x 7 minutes = 70 minutes
* Orchids: 6 x 3 minutes = 18 minutes
* Vines: 20 x 2 minutes = 40 minutes

To find the total time, we add up the time it will take to paint each type of flower:

85 + 70 + 18 + 40 = 213 minutes

So, it will take Ellen a total of 213 minutes to paint 17 lilies, 10 roses, 6 orchids, and 20 vines.

Answer: 213
