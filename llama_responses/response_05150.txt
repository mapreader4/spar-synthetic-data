Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the full price of two rackets at $60 each.

The full price of two rackets is 2 x $60 = $120.

Step 2: Apply the discount for the second racket.

The discount for the second racket is 50% off the full price, which is 0.5 x $60 = $30. So, the discounted price of the second racket is $60 - $30 = $30.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the two rackets.

The total cost is the cost of the first racket at full price, which is $60, plus the discounted price of the second racket, which is $30.

Answer: $60 + $30 = $90.
