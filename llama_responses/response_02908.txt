Let's break this problem down step by step.

Andrew earns a total of $400 from the bake sale. He keeps $100 for the cost of ingredients, so the remaining amount is:

$400 - $100 = $300

He donates half of this amount to the local homeless shelter, so the amount donated is:

$300 / 2 = $150

He also donates $10 from his own piggy bank to the local homeless shelter, so the total amount donated to the homeless shelter is:

$150 + $10 = $160

Answer: 160
