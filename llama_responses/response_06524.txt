Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find the total cost of the books. Lynne bought 7 books about cats, which cost 7 dollars each, so the total cost of the books is 7 * 7 = 49 dollars. She also bought 2 books about the solar system, which cost 7 dollars each, so the total cost of the books about the solar system is 2 * 7 = 14 dollars. The total cost of the books is 49 + 14 = 63 dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of the magazines. Lynne bought 3 magazines, which cost 4 dollars each, so the total cost of the magazines is 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. The total cost of the books and magazines is 63 + 12 = 75 dollars.

So, the total amount Lynne spent is 75 dollars.
