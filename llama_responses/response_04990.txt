Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Leo dropped off 10 pairs of trousers and some shirts at Sudsy Laundry.
* The bill was $140, which is the total cost of the shirts and trousers.
* The cost of each shirt is $5, and the cost of each pair of trousers is $9.
* The attendant initially said that Leo had only dropped off 2 shirts.

We can start by finding the cost of the 2 shirts that the attendant reported that Leo dropped off. 2 shirts x $5 per shirt = 2 x 5 = 10.

So, the total cost of the 2 shirts that Leo dropped off is $10.

Now, we know that the total cost of the bill was $140. The cost of the 10 pairs of trousers is 10 x 9 = 90. 90 + 10 = 100. So, the total cost of the trousers and shirts should be $100.

But the total cost of the bill was $140, which is 40 less than the expected total cost of the trousers and shirts. This means that some shirts are missing.

Let's find the difference between the total cost of the bill and the expected total cost:

$140 - 100 = 40.

Since the cost of each shirt is $5, we can divide the difference by 5 to find the number of missing shirts:

40 รท 5 = 8.

So, 8 shirts were missing.
