Let's break down the information given to us. We know that there are 14 kindergartners and 24 first graders, which means that the total number of students that are not second graders is 14 + 24 = 38. We also know that the total number of students is 42, which means that the number of second graders must be 42 - 38 = 4. Answer: 4.
