Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of fish in each color:

* Yellow fish: We know there are twice as many green ones as yellow ones. Let's call the number of yellow ones x. Then, the number of green ones will be 2x.
* Blue fish: There are half as many blue ones as yellow ones. Since we know the number of yellow ones is x, then the number of blue ones is x/2.
* Yellow fish: We know there are 12 yellow ones, so x = 12.

Now, let's find the total number of fish:

12 (yellow) + x/2 (blue) + 2x (green) =?

Let's add the number of yellow ones to the number of blue ones and the number of green ones:
12 + x/2 + 2x = 12 + 12 + 2x

To find the total number of fish, we can combine like terms:
12 + 12 + 2x = 24 + 2x

To find the value of 2x, we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
2x = (24 + 2x - 24)
2x = 2x

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 12

So, Olga has 12 + 12 + 2(12) = 36 fish in her aquarium.
