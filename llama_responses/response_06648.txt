Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Donna bought 3 times as many pencils as Marcia. So, Donna bought 3M pencils.

Marcia bought double the number of pencils as Cindi. So, Cindi bought 2 times the number of pencils as Donna and Marcia. Since Donna bought 3M pencils, that means Cindi bought 6M pencils.

So, Donna and Marcia bought 3M + 6M pencils altogether. To find the total number of pencils, we add 3M + 6M. That is 9M pencils.

But the problem asks for the cost of the pencils. Donna and Marcia spent $30 on $0.50 pencils. Since each pencil costs $0.50, the total cost is 9M x $0.50 = $4.50.

So, the answer is: Answer: 9M.
