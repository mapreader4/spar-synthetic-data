To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Harry's mother when she gave birth to him.

Let's first find the age of Harry's father. Since his father is 24 years older than Harry, we know that Harry's father is 50 - 24 = 26 years old. 

Now, we need to find the age of Harry's mother. Since Harry's mother is younger than his father by 1/25 of Harry's current age, we know that Harry's mother is 50 - (1/25) = 50 - 2 = 48 years old.

Answer: 48
