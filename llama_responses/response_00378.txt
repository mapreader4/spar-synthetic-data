Let's break this down step by step:

Let's first calculate the number of items Uki can sell in a day:

* Cupcakes: 20
* Cookies: 10
* Biscuits: 20

The total number of items Uki can sell in a day is 20 + 10 + 20 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings Uki can make in a day:

* Cupcakes: 20 * 1.50 = 30
* Cookies: 10 * 2 = 20
* Biscuits: 20 * 1 = 20

The total earnings Uki can make in a day is 30 + 20 + 20 = 70.

Since Uki works for 5 days, her total earnings will be 5 * 70 = 350.

Answer: 350
