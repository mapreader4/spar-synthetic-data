Let's break this down step by step!

First, Mary spent 10 minutes downloading the Mac version. Then, she needed the Windows version, which took three times as long to download, so that's 10 x 3 = 30 minutes.

So, the total time spent downloading is 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

Next, the audio glitched twice for 4 minutes each time, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 minutes. The video glitched once for 6 minutes. The total time spent on glitches is 8 + 6 = 14 minutes.

Mary spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches, so the time spent talking without glitches is 14 x 2 = 28 minutes.

The total time spent talking is 14 + 28 = 42 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent downloading and talking:

40 (downloading) + 42 (talking) = 82

Answer: 82
