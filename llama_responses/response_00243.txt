Let's break it down step by step.

Mckenna starts her day at 8:00 a.m. and works up to 11:00 a.m. That's 3 hours.

Then she joins her team at the conference room to talk about projects up to 13:00. That's another 2 hours.

Then, she works for another 2 hours, which would be from 13:00 to 15:00.

So, Mckenna stays at work for a total of 7 hours.

Answer: 7
