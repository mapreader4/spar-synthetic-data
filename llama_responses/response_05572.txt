Let's break this down step by step.

1. Alicia got 10 presents in small boxes.
2. Alicia got 12 presents in medium boxes.
3. A third of all the presents she is given are in large boxes.

To find the total number of presents Alicia got, we need to add the number of presents in small boxes, medium boxes, and large boxes.

First, we add the number of presents in small boxes and medium boxes: 10 + 12 = 22.
Then, we multiply this by 3, since a third of all the presents are in large boxes: 22 * 3 = 66.

So, the total number of presents Alicia got is 22 + 66 = 88.

Answer: 88
