Let's break down the cost of each item:

1. Hamburger meat: $5.00
2. Box of crackers: $3.50
3. 4 bags of frozen vegetables: 4 x $2.00 = $8.00
4. Pack of cheese: $3.50

Total cost before discount: $5.00 + $3.50 + $8.00 + $3.50 = $20.00

Ray gets 10% off his purchase, which means he gets $2.00 off his total bill (10% of $20.00).

To find the total grocery bill after the discount, subtract the discount from the original total:

$20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Answer: 18
