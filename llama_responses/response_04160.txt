Let's break this down step by step.

Hannah harvests 5 strawberries daily for the next whole month of April, which has 30 days. So, she will harvest a total of 5 * 30 = 150 strawberries.

She gives away 20 strawberries to her friends. So, she will have 150 - 20 = 130 strawberries left.

Then, 30 strawberries are stolen. So, she will have 130 - 30 = 100 strawberries left.

Answer: 100
