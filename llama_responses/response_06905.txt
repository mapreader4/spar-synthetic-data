Let's break this down step by step.

Peter has 20 books and has read 40% of them. 40% of 20 is 8. So, Peter has read 8 books.

His brother has read 10% of them. 10% of 20 is 2. So, his brother has read 2 books.

To find out how many more books Peter has read than his brother, we need to subtract the number of books his brother has read from the number of books Peter has read. That would be 8 - 2 = 6.

Answer: 6
