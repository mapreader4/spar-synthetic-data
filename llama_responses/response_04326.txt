Let's start by calculating how much Liam sold his oranges:

Liam picked 40 oranges and sold them at $2.50 for 2, which means he sold them at $1.25 per orange (2.50 / 2 = 1.25). So, he sold 40 x 1.25 = 50 dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much Claire sold her oranges:

Claire picked 30 oranges and sold them at $1.20 each, so she sold them for 30 x 1.20 = 36 dollars.

Now, let's add the amount of money they both made:

Liam made 50 dollars and Claire made 36 dollars, so together they made 50 + 36 = 86 dollars.

Answer: 86
