Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that Masud has 60 siblings. Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud, so we can set up an equation:

Janet's number of siblings = 60 - 4 * Masud's number of siblings

We know that Carlos has 3/4 times as many siblings as Masud, so we can set up another equation:

Carlos's number of siblings = 3/4 * Masud's number of siblings

We can now solve for Masud's number of siblings. We know that Carlos's number of siblings is equal to 3/4 of Masud's number of siblings, so:

Masud's number of siblings = Carlos's number of siblings / 3/4

Masud's number of siblings = Carlos's number of siblings / 3/4 = 60 / 3/4 = 80

So Masud has 80 siblings.

Now we can find Janet's number of siblings by subtracting 4 times Masud's number of siblings from 60:

Janet's number of siblings = 60 - 4 * Masud's number of siblings
= 60 - 4 * 80
= 60 - 320
= -260

Janet has -260 siblings. Since we cannot have a negative number of siblings, this means that Janet has 0 siblings.

The question asks how many more siblings Janet has more than Carlos. Since Janet has 0 siblings and Carlos has 80 siblings, the difference is:

80 - 0 = 80

Answer: 80
