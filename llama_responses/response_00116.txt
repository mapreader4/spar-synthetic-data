Let's break this down step by step.

Valerie has to mail thank you cards for her grandmother, uncle, and aunt, so that's 3 cards.

She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill, which is 2 bills.

She wants to send 3 more mail-in rebates than she does bills, so she'll send 2 + 3 = 5 rebates.

She has twice as many job applications as rebates, so she'll send 5 x 2 = 10 job applications.

So, in total, she'll be mailing:

* 3 thank you cards
* 2 bills
* 5 rebates
* 10 job applications

Each of these except the electric bill needs 1 stamp, and the electric bill needs 2 stamps. So, she'll need:

* 3 thank you cards + 2 bills + 5 rebates + 10 job applications = 20 stamps for 1-stamp items
* 1 electric bill = 2 stamps

Total number of stamps needed: 20 + 2 = 22

Answer: 22
