Let's start by finding the number of erasers Hanna has. Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel, so if we let the number of erasers Hanna has be x, then Rachel has x/2 erasers. We know that Rachel has 3 less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, and Tanya has 20 erasers, so she has 10 red erasers. We know that half of the 20 erasers are red, so the number of red erasers is 10. This means that Rachel has 10 - 3 = 7 red erasers. Therefore, Rachel has 7 red erasers. Since Rachel has 7 red erasers, and Rachel has 3 less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, we can conclude that Hanna has 7/2 = 3.5 erasers. Since Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel, Hanna has 3.5 * 2 = 7 erasers. Answer: 7
