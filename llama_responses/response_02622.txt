Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. Napoleon has 17 jelly beans.
2. Sedrich has 4 more jelly beans than Napoleon. So, Sedrich has 17 + 4 = 21 jelly beans.
3. The sum of Napoleon and Sedrich's jelly beans is 17 + 21 = 38.
4. This sum is 4 times the number of jelly beans that Mikey has. So, Mikey has 38 / 4 = 9.5 jelly beans.

Answer: 9.
