Let's break down the problem step by step.

James buys 20 pounds of beef and half that much pork. This means he buys 20 + 20/2 = 30 pounds of meat.

He uses 1.5 pounds of meat to make meals at his restaurant. This means he has 30 - 1.5 = 28.5 pounds of meat left.

Each meal sells for $20.  So, he makes 28.5 * 20 = 570 dollars.
