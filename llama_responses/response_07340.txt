Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. John has twice the number of children that her sister has.
2. Gabriel has six grandkids.

We can start by identifying the number of children that Yasmin has. We can do this by using the information that John has twice the number of children that her sister has.

So, Yasmin has x number of children, and Gabriel has 6 grandkids. John has twice that number of children. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

x = (6 / 2)

x = 3

So, Yasmin has 3 children.
