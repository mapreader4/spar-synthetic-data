Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate how many cookies Patty can buy with her $15.

Since each pack of cookies costs $3, we can divide $15 by 3 to get the number of packs she can buy:

$15 รท 3 = 5

So Patty can buy 5 packs of cookies. Each pack has 24 cookies, so the total number of cookies she can buy is:

5 packs x 24 cookies per pack = 120 cookies

Now, Patty has 120 cookies. She agrees to give 3 cookies for each chore, so to find out how many chores she can do with the cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 3:

120 cookies รท 3 = 40

So, Patty can do 40 chores with her cookies.
