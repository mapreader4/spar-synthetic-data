Let's break this down step by step.

Miriam spent 30 minutes doing laundry, which is 30 minutes.

She spent 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom, which is 15 minutes.

She spent an unknown amount of time cleaning her room. Let's call this amount of time x.

She spent 40 minutes doing homework, which is 40 minutes.

The total time spent on these tasks is 30 + 15 + x + 40. This is equal to 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The unknown time spent cleaning her room is x. Let's set up an equation to solve for x.

30 + 15 + x = 120 - 40

x = 65

So, the time spent cleaning her room is 65 minutes.

Answer: 65
