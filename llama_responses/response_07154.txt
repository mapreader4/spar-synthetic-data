Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Alexis bought 21 pairs of pants and 18 dresses. We also know that Alexis bought 3 times more pants than Isabella.

We can start by identifying the number of pants bought by Isabella. Since Alexis bought 3 times more pants than Isabella, and Alexis bought 21 pairs of pants, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the number of pants bought by Isabella.

Then, we know that 3x = 21 - 21. We can solve for x:

3x = 21 - 21
x = 0

So, Isabella bought 0 pairs of pants.

Now, we know that Isabella bought 18 dresses. So, the total number of items bought by Isabella is:

0 + 18 = 18

Answer: 18
