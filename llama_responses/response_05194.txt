Let's break this problem down step by step.

Sean buys 100 patches at $1.25 each, so his total cost is:

100 x $1.25 = $125

He sells each patch for $12.00, so his total revenue is:

100 x $12.00 = $1200

To find his net profit, we need to subtract his cost from his revenue:

$1200 (revenue) - $125 (cost) = $1075

Answer: 1075
