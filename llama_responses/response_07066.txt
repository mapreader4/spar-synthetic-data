Let's break it down step by step.

The school bought 20 cartons of pencils, which means there are 20 * 10 boxes of pencils, so there are 200 pencils. Each box of pencils costs 2 dollars, so the cost of the pencils is 200 * 2 = 400 dollars.

The school also bought 10 cartons of markers, which means there are 10 * 5 boxes of markers, so there are 50 markers. Each box of markers costs 4 dollars, so the cost of the markers is 50 * 4 = 200 dollars.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the pencils and the cost of the markers. So, the total cost is 400 + 200 = 600 dollars.
