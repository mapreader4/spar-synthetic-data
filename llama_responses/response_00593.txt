Let's break this problem down step by step.

On the first day, the snowdrift is formed, but we don't know how deep it is yet. We'll call this unknown depth "x".

On the second day, half of the snowdrift melts, which means the depth of the snowdrift is reduced by half of "x". Let's call this reduced depth "x/2".

On the third day, 6 inches of snow is added to the snowdrift, so the new depth is "x/2" + 6.

On the fourth day, 18 inches of snow is added to the snowdrift, so the new depth is ("x/2" + 6) + 18.

We know that the snowdrift is 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, so we can set up the equation:

("x/2" + 6) + 18 = 34

Simplifying the equation, we get:

"x/2" + 24 = 34

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get:

"x/2" = 10

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

"x" = 20

So, the snowdrift was 20 inches deep at the end of the first day.

Answer: 20
