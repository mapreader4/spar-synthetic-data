Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the initial amount of dumbbells Parker has. The problem states that there are 4 twenty pounds of dumbbells. So, Parker has 4 x 20 = 80 pounds of dumbbells.

Parker then adds two more dumbbells to the setup, which means he adds 2 x 20 = 40 pounds more dumbbells. So, the total amount of dumbbells Parker is using for his exercises is 80 + 40 = 120 pounds.
