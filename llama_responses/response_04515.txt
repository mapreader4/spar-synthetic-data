Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1: 2 days ago, Oliver washed 5 kilos of laundry, so he earned 5 x 2 = 10 dollars.

Day 2: Yesterday, he washed 5 + 5 = 10 kilos of laundry, so he earned 10 + 5 = 15 dollars.

Day 3: Today, he washed 15 x 2 = 30 kilos of laundry, so he earned 30 dollars.

Total earnings = 10 + 15 + 30 = 55 dollars.

Answer: 55
