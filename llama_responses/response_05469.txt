Let's start by adding up the number of brown M&M's Robby didn't eat across all the bags:

9 (first bag) + 12 (second bag) + 8 (third and fourth bags) + 3 (fifth bag) = 32

Now, to find the average, we need to divide the total number of brown M&M's by the number of bags:

32 รท 5 (number of bags) = 6.4

However, since the problem asks for the average number of brown M&M's in a bag, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, the average is:

Answer: 6
