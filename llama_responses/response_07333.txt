Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the cost of the lightsaber toy is x.

The cost of all his other Star Wars toys combined is $1000.  So the lightsaber toy is 2x that amount, so the cost of the lightsaber toy is 2 x $1000 = $2000.

The total cost of all his Star Wars toys, including the lightsaber, is $1000 + $2000 = $3000.

So the answer is: Answer: 3000.
