To solve this problem, we can start by dividing the total number of credits required to graduate by the number of semesters.

The total number of credits required to graduate is 120.
The number of semesters is 8.

To find the number of credits per semester, we can divide the total number of credits by the number of semesters.

120 / 8 = 15
