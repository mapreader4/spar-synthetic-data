Let's break this problem down step by step.

Mike prints 600 pamphlets per hour for 9 hours, so he prints:

600 pamphlets/hour * 9 hours = 5400 pamphlets

After a break, Mike prints at a third of his original speed, which is:

600 pamphlets/hour / 3 = 200 pamphlets/hour

He works for 2 more hours, so he prints:

200 pamphlets/hour * 2 hours = 400 pamphlets

In total, Mike prints:

5400 pamphlets + 400 pamphlets = 5800 pamphlets

Leo works a third as many hours as Mike did before his break, which is:

9 hours / 3 = 3 hours

Leo is twice as fast as Mike before his break, which means he prints:

600 pamphlets/hour * 2 = 1200 pamphlets/hour

Leo works for 3 hours, so he prints:

1200 pamphlets/hour * 3 hours = 3600 pamphlets

In total, Mike and Leo print:

5800 pamphlets + 3600 pamphlets = 9400 pamphlets

Answer: 9400
