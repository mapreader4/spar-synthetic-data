Let's break this down step by step.

Jake starts with $5000. He spends $2800 on a new motorcycle, so he has $5000 - $2800 = $2200 left.

Then, he spends half of what's left on a concert ticket. Half of $2200 is $1100. So, Jake has $2200 - $1100 = $1000 left.

Finally, he loses a fourth of what he has left. A fourth of $1000 is $250. So, Jake has $1000 - $250 = $750 left.

Answer: 750
