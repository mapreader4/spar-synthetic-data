Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: We know that Matt orders 15 pounds of beef.

Step 2: We know that he cuts the 15 pounds of beef into 12-ounce steaks.

Step 3: To find out how many steaks Matt gets, we need to divide the total amount of beef (15 pounds) by the weight of each steak (12 ounces).

Answer: 15 pounds / 12 ounces = 1.25 steaks.

So, Matt gets 1.25 steaks.
