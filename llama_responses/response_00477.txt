Let's break down the information given:

* The couple had 20 couples from their side of the family, which means 40 people.
* The total number of guests is 180.
* The number of friends is the total number of guests minus the number of family members, which is 180 - 40 = 140.

So, the number of friends who attended the reception is 140.
