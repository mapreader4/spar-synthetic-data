Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Saturday, the park had 200 visitors.
2. On Sunday, there were 40 more visitors than on Saturday. So, the number of visitors on Sunday is 200 + 40 = 240.
3. To find the total number of people in the park over the two days, we need to add the number of visitors on Saturday and Sunday together. 200 + 240 = 440.

Answer: 440
