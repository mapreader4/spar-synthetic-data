Let's break down the information:

Bucky caught 5 fish, and 60% of those were trout. 60% of 5 is 3. So, he caught 3 trout. The rest were blue-gill. 5 - 3 is 2, so he caught 2 blue-gill.

He earned $35 from the fish. 3 trout at $5 each and 2 blue-gill at $4 each. So, he earned 3 x 5 + 2 x 4 = 15.

He needs $60 for the game, but he has $35. He needs $60 - $35 = $25 more.
