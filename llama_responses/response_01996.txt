Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of flowers Ali sold on Monday is x.

Then, on Tuesday, he sold 8 flowers.

Then, on Friday, he sold double the number of flowers he sold on Monday. So, on Friday, he sold 2x flowers.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of flowers Ali sold:

x + 8 + 2x = Total flowers

We know that the total number of flowers Ali sold is the sum of the number of flowers he sold on Monday and the number of flowers he sold on Friday.

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

x + 8 + 2x = Total flowers
x + 8 = Total flowers - 8
x = 8

So, the number of flowers Ali sold on Monday is 8.

Now, we can add 8 to that number to find the total number of flowers he sold:

8 + 8 = 16

Answer: 16
