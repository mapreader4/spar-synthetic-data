Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total cost of the ingredients.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box.  There are 8 servings in the recipe.  The cost per serving is $1.00 / 8 = $0.125 per serving.

The sauce is $2.00 for a jar.  There are 8 servings in the recipe.  The cost per serving is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per serving.

The meatballs are $5.00 for 1 pound.  There are 8 servings in the recipe.  The cost per serving is $5.00 / 8 = $0.625 per serving.

Now, let's add up the costs of each ingredient.

$0.125 + $0.25 + $0.625 = $0.95

The cost per serving is $0.95.
