Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of water Jacob can collect in a day:

800 milliliters from rain + 1700 milliliters from the river = 2500 milliliters per day

The tank can hold up to 50 liters, and we need to convert milliliters to liters. There are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, so:

2500 milliliters per day รท 1000 = 2.5 liters per day

To find out how many days it takes to fill up the tank, we can divide the capacity of the tank by the amount Jacob can collect in a day:

50 liters (tank capacity) รท 2.5 liters per day = 20 days

Answer: 20
