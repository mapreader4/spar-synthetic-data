Let's break this down step by step:

1. Derek was 6 years old when he had three times as many dogs as cars. This means that the number of dogs is equal to 3 times the number of cars.

2. Let's call the number of cars when Derek was 6 years old "x". Then, the number of dogs is also equal to 3x.

3. Ten years later, Derek sold some dogs and bought 210 more cars. The number of cars became twice the number of dogs. This means that the number of cars is now 2(3x).

4. Since the number of cars is 2(3x), the number of cars is 6x.

5. The number of dogs is still the same as it was when Derek was 6 years old, which is 3x. So, the number of dogs is still 3x.

6. We know that the number of dogs is 90 when Derek is 16 years old, which is 10 years after he was 6 years old. This means that the number of dogs is 90 when the number of cars is 6x.

7. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x = 90. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3, which gives us x = 30.

8. Since x is the number of cars when Derek was 6 years old, the number of dogs is also 30 when he was 6 years old.

9. The number of dogs is 3x when Derek was 6 years old, so the number of dogs is 3(30) = 90.

Answer: 90
