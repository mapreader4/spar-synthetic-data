Let's start by identifying the number of grape candies. We know that the number of grape candies is 3 times the number of cherry candies, and the number of cherry candies is 2 times the number of grape candies. So, let's call the number of grape candies x.

We know that the total cost of the candies is $200. The cost of a grape candy is $2.50, so the total cost of x grape candies is 2.50x.

We can write an equation to represent this:

2.50x = 200

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.50:

x = 200 / 2.50

x = 80

So, there are 80 grape candies in the store.
