To find the number of slightly used crayons, we can start by finding the total number of crayons that are not new or broken.  Since one third of the crayons are new, that is 40.  The 20 that are broken are broken, so the remaining crayons are 120 - 40 - 20 = 60.  Therefore, the number of slightly used crayons is 60.
