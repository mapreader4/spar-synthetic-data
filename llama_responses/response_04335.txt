Let's think step by step.

Step 1: We know that James has 5 dozen boxes of matches. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so we multiply 5 by 12 to get the total number of matches:

5 * 12 = 60

Step 2: Each box contains 20 matches. To get the total number of matches, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of matches per box:

60 * 20 = 1200

Answer: 1200
