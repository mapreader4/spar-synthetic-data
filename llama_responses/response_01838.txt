Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of blocks of each color:

* Red blocks: Let's say the number of red blocks is R.
* Yellow blocks: There are 7 more yellow blocks than red blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is R + 7.
* Blue blocks: There are 14 more blue blocks than red blocks, so the number of blue blocks is R + 14.

Now, we can find the total number of blocks by adding the number of blocks of each color together:

R (red blocks) + (R + 7) (yellow blocks) + (R + 14) (blue blocks)

To solve for R, we can add the 3 expressions together:

R + (R + 7) + (R + 14) = 18 + 7 + 14

Combine like terms:

18 + 7 + 14 = 39

Answer: 39
