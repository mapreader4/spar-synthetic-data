Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Nicky spent 20 minutes waiting to take a number.
2. He then waited quadruple that amount of time plus 14 minutes. To do this, we multiply the 20 minutes by 4, which is 80. Then we add 14 minutes to that, which is 94 minutes.
3. The total time is the sum of the two parts, so we add 20 minutes + 94 minutes, which is 114 minutes.

Answer: 114
