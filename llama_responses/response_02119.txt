Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total number of oranges initially given to the students. 12 students were given 108 oranges.

Let's subtract the 36 bad oranges from the total, since they were thrown away. 108 - 36 = 72.

Now, to find out how many oranges each student will get, we divide the 72 oranges by the number of students, which is 12.

72 / 12 = 6

So, the students will get 6 oranges each.

Answer: 6
