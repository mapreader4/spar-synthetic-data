Let's start by identifying the number of pets each of Taylor's friends has. 3 of his friends come first, and each has twice as many pets as Taylor has. So each of them has 2 pets. Another two of his friends have 2 pets each. So, the total number of pets they have is: 3 x 2 + 2 x 2 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the answer is: Answer: 8.
