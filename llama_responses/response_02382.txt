Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Tanya spent. Tanya bought 2 face moisturizers for 50$ each, so she spent 2 x 50 = 100$ on face moisturizers. She also bought 4 body lotions for 60$ each, so she spent 4 x 60 = 240$ on body lotions. In total, Tanya spent 100$ + 240$ = 340$.

Now, Christy spent twice as much as Tanya, so she spent 2 x 340$ = 680$.

Finally, to find the total amount they spent together, we add Tanya's spending to Christy's spending: 340$ + 680$ = 1020$.

Answer: 1020
