Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Rhonda has x marbles. Since Amon has 55 more marbles than Rhonda, that means Amon has x + 55 marbles.

We know that the total number of marbles Amon and Rhonda have is 215. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 55) = 215.

We can subtract x from both sides of the equation to get x = 160.

So, Rhonda has 160 marbles.

Answer: 160
