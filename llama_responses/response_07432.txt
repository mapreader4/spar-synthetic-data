Let's break this down step by step.

Mike washes 9 cars, which takes 10 minutes each, so he takes 9 * 10 = 90 minutes to wash the cars.

Mike changes oil on 6 cars, which takes 15 minutes each, so he takes 6 * 15 = 90 minutes to change the oil.

Mike changes 2 sets of tires, which takes 30 minutes each, so he takes 2 * 30 = 60 minutes to change the tires.

In total, Mike takes 90 + 90 + 60 = 240 minutes to wash, change the oil, and change the tires.

To convert minutes to hours, we can divide 240 by 60, which is the number of minutes in an hour. 240 / 60 = 4.
