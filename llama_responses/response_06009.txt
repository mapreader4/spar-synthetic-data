Let's start by finding the total number of roses that Lorelei can pick.

The first rose bush has 12 red flowers, and she picks 50% of them, which is 12 x 0.5 = 6 red flowers.

The second rose bush has 18 pink flowers, and she picks 50% of them, which is 18 x 0.5 = 9 pink flowers.

The third rose bush has 20 yellow flowers, and she picks 25% of them, which is 20 x 0.25 = 5 yellow flowers.

The fourth rose bush has 8 orange flowers, and she picks 25% of them, which is 8 x 0.25 = 2 orange flowers.

In total, Lorelei picks 6 + 9 + 5 + 2 = 22 roses.

Answer: 22
