Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Jordan picked 54 mangoes.
* One-third of the mangoes were ripe, and the other two-thirds were not yet ripe.
* Jordan kept 16 unripe mangoes and gave the remainder to his sister.
* The remainder is 54 - 16 = 38.
* Jordan's sister can fill 4 mangoes in each jar, so we need to find how many jars she can fill.

To find the number of jars, we can divide 38 by 4.

38 รท 4 = 9.5

Answer: 9
