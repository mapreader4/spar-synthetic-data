Let's start by using the information given to us. We know that Beth has 72 marbles in total. We also know that she loses 5 red marbles. So, she has 72 - 5 = 67 marbles left. Then, she loses twice as many blue marbles as red ones. So, she loses 2 * 5 = 10 blue marbles. Then, she loses 3 times as many yellow marbles as red ones. So, she loses 3 * 5 = 15 yellow marbles. Now, she has 67 - 10 - 15 = 42 marbles left. Answer: 42.
