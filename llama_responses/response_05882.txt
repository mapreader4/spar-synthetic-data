Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many slices of bread Suzanne makes per day. She makes French toast for the family on Saturdays and Sundays. So, she makes French toast for 2 days in a week. The number of slices of bread used per day is:

2 slices for Suzanne, 1 slice for her husband, and 1 slice for her daughters, which is a total of 3 slices per day. 

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices used in a week. There are 7 days in a week, and Suzanne makes French toast for 2 days. So, the total number of slices used in a week is:

2 days * 3 slices per day = 6 slices

Step 3: Calculate the total number of loaves of bread needed over 52 weeks. Since each loaf has 12 slices, we can find the total number of loaves needed as follows:

Total slices in a week = 6 slices
Total loaves needed = Total slices / 12 slices per loaf
= 6 slices / 12 slices per loaf
= 0.5 loaves

Step 4: Since you can't buy a fraction of a loaf, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, the total number of loaves needed is:

0.5 loaves -> 1 loaves
