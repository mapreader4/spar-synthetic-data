Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Travis and his brother together collected 68 pieces of candy altogether.

Travis and his brother each ate 4 pieces of candy.

So, they ate a total of 4 + 4 = 8 pieces of candy together.

So, they had 68 - 8 = 60 pieces of candy left.

Answer: 60
