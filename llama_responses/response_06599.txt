Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find out how many potatoes Gina got. We know that Tom got twice as much as Gina, so if Gina got x potatoes, then Tom got 2x potatoes.

Next, we know that Anne got one-third of the amount Tom got. If Tom got 2x potatoes, then Anne got (1/3) * 2x = 2x/3 potatoes.

Now, we know that the total amount of potatoes given away is Gina + Tom + Anne. So, we can set up an equation: Gina + Tom + Anne = 69 + 2x + (2x/3).

We know that Gina got 69 potatoes, so we can substitute 69 for Gina in the equation: 69 + 2x + (2x/3) = 300.

Now, we can solve for x. To do this, we can start by subtracting 69 from both sides of the equation: 69 + 2x + (2x/3) - 69 = 300 - 69 = 2x + (2x/3).

Now, we can simplify the left side of the equation: 2x + (2x/3) = 231.

To solve for x, we can subtract 2x from both sides: 2x = 231 - 2x = (2x/3).

Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get: 6x = 693.

So, the value of x is 693/6 = 116.5.

Answer: 116
