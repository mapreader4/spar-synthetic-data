Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: If Rob planned on spending three hours reading in preparation for his literature exam, that means he had a total of 3 hours to read.

Step 2: If he ends up spending only three-quarters of this time reading, that means he spent 3/4 of the total time reading. To find the fraction of the total time he spent reading, we can convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. So, 3/4 is the same as 0.75.

Step 3: Since Rob reads a page every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many pages he read. To do this, we can multiply the number of pages read per 15 minutes by the total time spent reading. The total time spent reading is 0.75 hours, which is the same as 0.75 x 60 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to 45 minutes. So, we multiply 1 page per 15 minutes by 45 minutes to get the total number of pages read, which is 1.

Step 4: Therefore, the total number of pages read is 1 page.
