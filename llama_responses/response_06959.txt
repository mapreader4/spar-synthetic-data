Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many dolls Andrena had before receiving the gifts.

Andrena received 2 dolls from Debelyn and 5 dolls from Christel. So, Andrena had 2 + 5 = 7 dolls before receiving the gifts.

Now, let's find out how many dolls Debelyn had.

Debelyn gave 2 dolls to Andrena, so Debelyn had 20 - 2 = 18 dolls before giving the gift.

Now, let's compare the number of dolls Andrena has with the number of dolls Debelyn had before giving the gift.

Andrena has 7 dolls and Debelyn had 18 dolls. To find out how many more dolls Andrena has than Debelyn, we subtract the number of dolls Debelyn had from the number of dolls Andrena has.

7 - 18 = -5 = 3

Andrena has 3 more dolls than Debelyn.
