Let's start by identifying the given information:

* 50 cartons of canned juice are packed.
* 40 cartons have been loaded on the truck.

To find the number of cans of juice left to be loaded on the truck, we can subtract the number of cartons already loaded from the total number of cartons:

50 (total cartons) - 40 (cartons loaded on the truck) =?

Let's perform the subtraction:

50 - 40 = 10

Answer: 10
