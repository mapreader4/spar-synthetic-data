Let's start by using the information given. Jana is 5 inches taller than Kelly, so Jana's height is Kelly's height plus 5 inches. Kelly's height is Jess's height minus 3 inches, so Kelly's height is 72 - 3 = 69 inches. Jana's height is Kelly's height plus 5, which is 69 + 5 = 74 inches. 

Answer: 74
