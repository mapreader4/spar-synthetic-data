Let's break this down step by step:

1. Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills. She wants to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. This means she will have 1 piece of $100 bills left.

2. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills. This is 1 piece of $10 bills.

3. The rest of the $100 bill is changed to $5 bills. This is 1 piece of $5 bills.

So, in total, Lorie will have:

1 piece of $100 bill
1 piece of $10 bill
1 piece of $5 bill
