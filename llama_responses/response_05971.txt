Let's think step by step.

We know that Matt can buy keychains in packs of 10 for $20, or in packs of 4 for $12. So, the cost per keychain in a pack of 10 is $2, and the cost per keychain in a pack of 4 is $3. 

If Matt chooses to buy 20 keychains, he can buy 2 packs of 10 keychains for $40, or 5 packs of 4 keychains for $60. 

Since 2 packs of 10 keychains cost $40, and 5 packs of 4 keychains cost $60, Matt can buy 20 keychains at a lower price. 

The cost of buying 20 keychains in packs of 10 is 2 x 2 = $4. The cost of buying 20 keychains in packs of 4 is 3 x 5 = $15. 

Matt can save $15 by buying 20 keychains at a lower price.
