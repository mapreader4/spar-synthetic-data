Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of players who are older than 35 years. We know that three-eighths of the total number of players are older than 35, so we can set up an equation:

Let x be the total number of players who are older than 35. Then, we know that 3/8 of x are older than 35, so we can set up an equation:

3/8x = x

We can multiply both sides by 8 to get:

3x = 8x

Now, we know that the total number of players is 1000. We can set up an equation:

3x = 800

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = 800 / 3

x = 266.67

We know that x is an integer, so we round down to the nearest whole number:

x = 266

Now, we want to find the number of players who are younger than 25 years. We know that two-fifths of the total number of players are younger than 25, so we can set up an equation:

2/5x = x - 266

We can solve for x by subtracting 266 from both sides:

2/5x = x - 266

x = 266

Now, we know that x = 266, which means that 266 players are younger than 25 years.

Answer: 266
