Let's start by identifying the given information and variables.

We know that Omar can raise his kite 240 feet into the air in 12 minutes. This means that Omar's rate of raising his kite is 240 feet per minute.

We are told that Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. So, Jasper's rate of raising his kite is 3 x 240 feet per minute, which is 720 feet per minute.

We are asked to find the time it takes for Jasper to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet. To do this, we can set up a proportion.

Let's set up the proportion:

(600 feet) / (720 feet per minute) = (time)

To solve for the time, we can multiply both sides of the proportion by 1.

(600 feet) / (720 feet per minute) = x

x = (600) / 720

x = 5

So, it will take Jasper 5 minutes to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet.
