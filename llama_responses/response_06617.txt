To find the percent increase in the cost of each ticket, we need to find the difference between the new cost and the old cost, then divide that by the old cost, and multiply by 100.

The old cost was $85 and the new cost is $102. The difference is $102 - $85 = $17.

The difference is $17. To find the percent increase, we divide the difference by the old cost: $17 รท $85 = 0.20, or 20%.
