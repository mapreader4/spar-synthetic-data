Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by identifying the total number of haircuts Calvin has gotten: 8.

His goal is to get 2 more haircuts to reach his goal, so we can find the total number of haircuts needed: 8 + 2 = 10.

To find the percentage, we can divide the total number of haircuts needed by the total number of haircuts he has gotten: 10 รท 8 = 1.25.

So, Calvin has 1.25 haircuts towards his goal.
