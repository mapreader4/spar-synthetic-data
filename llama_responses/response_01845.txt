Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of the CDs Julia wants to buy:

* Rock CDs: 4 * 5 = 20
* Pop CDs: 4 * 10 = 40
* Dance CDs: 4 * 3 = 12
* Country CDs: 4 * 7 = 28

The total cost is 20 + 40 + 12 + 28 = 100.

Julia has 75 dollars. To find out how much she is short, we need to subtract the total cost from 75:

75 - 100 = -25

Answer: 25
