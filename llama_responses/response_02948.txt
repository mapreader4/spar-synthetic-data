Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the bottom level. It has 7 legos per side, so the total number of legos in the bottom level is 7 * 2 = 14.

The next level up has one less lego per side than the level below it, so it has 7 - 1 = 6 legos per side. The total number of legos in this level is 6 * 2 = 12.

The next level up has one less lego per side than the level below it, so it has 6 - 1 = 5 legos per side. The total number of legos in this level is 5 * 2 = 10.

The top level has one less lego per side than the level below it, so it has 5 - 1 = 4 legos per side. The total number of legos in this level is 4 * 2 = 8.

Now, let's add up the total number of legos in all levels: 14 + 12 + 10 + 8 = 44.

So, Bob needs 44 legos in total to build his pyramid.
