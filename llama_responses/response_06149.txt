Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total weight of the chips and cookies. Jasmine buys 6 bags of chips, each of which weighs 20 ounces. So, the total weight of the chips is 6 * 20 = 120 ounces. She also buys 4 times as many tins of cookies, so the total weight of the cookies is 4 * 9 = 36 ounces.

To find the total weight of the bags of chips and tins of cookies, we add the weights together: 120 ounces of chips + 36 ounces of cookies = 156 ounces.

Since 156 ounces is equal to 9.75 pounds, Jasmine has to carry 9.75 pounds.
