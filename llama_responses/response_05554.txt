Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Dante needs half as many cups of flour as he needs eggs. This means that if he uses x cups of eggs, he needs x/2 cups of flour.

We are given that Dante uses 60 eggs. So, we can set up an equation:

x/2 = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 2 * x = 2 * 60
x = 120

Answer: 120
