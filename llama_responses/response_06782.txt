To solve this problem, we need to find 20% of the price of the guitar that Gerald bought.

The price of the guitar that Gerald bought is not given in the problem. Let's assume it is x.

The problem states that the price of the guitar that Gerald bought is 20% more than the price of the guitar that Hendricks bought. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

x - 20% of the price of the guitar that Gerald bought = 200

This equation is telling us that 20% of the price of the guitar that Gerald bought is equal to 200. So, we can solve for the price of the guitar that Gerald bought:

x = 200 / 0.2 = 1000

So, Gerald paid 100 for his guitar.

Answer: 100
