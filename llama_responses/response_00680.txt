Let's start by converting the word problem into a mathematical equation.

Cecil has 600. Catherine has 250 less than twice as much as Cecil, so Cecil has 250. Cecil has 600, and Catherine has 250. Carmela has 50 more than twice Cecil's money. Cecil has 600, so Carmela has 650. Now, let's add all of their money together.

Cecil has 600. Catherine has 250. Carmela has 650. So, in total, they have 600 + 250 + 50 = 900.

Answer: 900
