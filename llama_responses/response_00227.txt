Let's break this down step by step.

Ian started with $100.

He paid $20 to Colin.

Ian has $100 - $20 = $80 left.

He paid twice as much to Helen, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

Ian has $80 - $40 = $40 left.

He paid half as much to Benedict, which is $40 / 2 = $20.

Ian has $40 - $20 = $20 left.

Ian has $20 left.

Answer: 20
