Let's break this problem down step by step.

Jack needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of shoes. Each pair of socks cost $9.50, so the total cost of the socks is 2 x 9.50 = 18.50. The shoes cost $92. The total cost of the socks and shoes is 18.50 + 92 = 110.50. Jack has $40. So, he needs 110.50 - 40 = 70.50 more money.
