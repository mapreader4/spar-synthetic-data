Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Start with the wheel of brie cheese: 8 ounces.
2. Add the loaf of bread: 1 pound.
3. Add the pound of tomatoes: 1 pound.
4. Add the 2 pounds of zucchini: 2 pounds.
5. Add the 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts: 1.5 pounds.
6. Add the 8 ounces of fresh raspberries: 0.5 pounds.
7. Add the 8 ounces of fresh blueberries: 0.5 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the food:

8 + 1 + 2 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 12

Answer: 12
