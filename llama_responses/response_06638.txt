Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "Milton has some books about zoology and 4 times as many books about botany."

From this, we know that Milton has some books about zoology. Let's call this number x. Then, we know that he has 4 times as many books about botany. So, we can write an equation to represent the number of books about zoology:

x + 4x = 80

We know that the total number of books is 80, so we can set the total number of books about zoology as x. Then, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total number of books about botany:

x * 4 = 80 / 4 = 20

So, Milton has 20 books about botany. So, the number of zoology books is x = 20.

Answer: 20
