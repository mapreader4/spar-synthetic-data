Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by counting the number of books initially in the library, which is 250.

Then, 120 books are taken out on Tuesday. So, we subtract 120 from 250 to get the number of books left in the library. 250 - 120 = 130.

Then, 35 books are returned on Wednesday. So, we add 35 to the number of books left in the library. 130 + 35 = 165.

Finally, 15 books are withdrawn on Thursday. So, we subtract 15 from the number of books left in the library. 165 - 15 = 150.

Answer: 150
