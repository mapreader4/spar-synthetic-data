Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that there are 13 rabbits in the cage initially, and that 7 more are added to the cage. This means that the total number of rabbits in the cage is now 13 + 7 = 20.

We are told that the number of rabbits in the cage is 1/3 the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today. We can represent this as an equation:

20 = 1/3 x = x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 3(20) = 60

So, Jasper saw 60 rabbits in the park today.
