Let's break down the problem step by step.

There are 3 goldfish and 10 platyfish in the fish tank.

Each goldfish plays with 10 red balls, which means the total number of red balls from the goldfish is 3 * 10 = 30.

Each platyfish plays with 5 white balls, which means the total number of white balls from the platyfish is 10 * 5 = 50.

To find the total number of balls in the fish tank, we add the number of red balls and the number of white balls: 30 + 50 = 80.

Answer: 80
