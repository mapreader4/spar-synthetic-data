Let's break down the problem step by step:

Last year, Jessica's monthly expenses were:

1. Rent: $1000
2. Food: $200
3. Car insurance: $100

Total monthly expenses: $1000 + $200 + $100 = $1300

This year, her rent goes up by 30%, which means it increases by 30% of $1000, which is:

$1000 x 0.30 = $300

So, this year her rent is $1000 + $300 = $1300

Her food costs increase by 50%, which means it increases by 50% of $200, which is:

$200 x 0.50 = $100

So, this year her food is $200 + $100 = $300

Her car insurance triples, which means it increases by 200% of $100, which is:

$100 x 2 = $200

So, this year her car insurance is $100 + $200 = $300

This year, her total monthly expenses are:

1. Rent: $1300
2. Food: $300
3. Car insurance: $300

Total monthly expenses: $1300 + $300 + $300 = $1900

To find the difference in her expenses over the whole year, we need to multiply the difference between her old and new expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$1900 - $1300 = $600

So, Jessica pays $600 more over the whole year compared to last year.
