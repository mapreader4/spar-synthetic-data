Let's start by calculating the total weight of the clothes Tony is already washing:

Pants: 10 ounces
Shirts: 2 x 5 ounces = 10 ounces
Shorts: 8 ounces
Socks: 3 x 2 ounces = 6 ounces

Total weight: 10 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 34 ounces

The rule is that Tony is only allowed to wash 50 total ounces of clothing at a time. So, he can add a maximum of 50 - 34 = 16 ounces more to the wash.

Underwear weighs 4 ounces each, so to find out how many more pairs of underwear Tony can add, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of one pair of underwear:

16 ounces / 4 ounces = 4 pairs of underwear

So, Tony can add 4 more pairs of underwear to the wash without breaking the rule.
