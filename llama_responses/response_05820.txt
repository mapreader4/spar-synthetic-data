Let's break this down step by step.

On Monday, Mrs. Young made 10 bonnets. On Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she made 10 + 2 = 12 bonnets. On Thursday, she made 12 + 5 = 17 bonnets. On Friday, she made 17 - 5 = 12 bonnets.

In total, Mrs. Young made 10 + 12 + 12 = 34 bonnets. Since she divided the bonnets evenly among 5 orphanages, we can divide 34 by 5 to find the number of bonnets each orphanage received:

34 รท 5 = 6.8

Since we can't divide a fraction of bonnets, Mrs. Young rounded the number to the nearest whole number, which is 6. So, she sent 6 bonnets to each orphanage.

Answer: 6
