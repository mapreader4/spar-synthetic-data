Let's start by identifying the number of swordfish and pufferfish in the aquarium.

Let's say the number of swordfish is x.

Since there are as many swordfish as pufferfish, the number of pufferfish will also be x.

The total number of fish is 90.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + x = 90

We know that the number of swordfish is equal to the number of pufferfish, so we can substitute x for x in the equation:

x + x = 90

To solve for x, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation:

x = 45

So, there are 45 pufferfish in the aquarium.
