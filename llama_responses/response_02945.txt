Let's start by calculating the total time taken by Polly. Polly takes an average of 28 seconds per move, so for 30 moves, the total time taken by Polly will be:

28 * 30 = 840 seconds

Now, let's calculate the total time taken by Peter. Peter takes an average of 40 seconds per move, so for 30 moves, the total time taken by Peter will be:

40 * 30 = 1200 seconds

The total time taken by both players is the sum of the time taken by Polly and Peter:

840 + 1200 = 2040 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so to convert the total time to minutes, we can divide the total time by 60:

2040 / 60 = 34

The answer is:

Answer: 34
