Let's break this down step by step.

1. The first tank has a capacity of 7000 gallons and is filled up to 3/4 of its capacity. To find the amount of water in the first tank, we can multiply the capacity by the fraction:

7000 * 3/4 = 5250 gallons

So, the first tank has 5250 gallons of water.

2. The second tank has a capacity of 5000 gallons and is filled up to 4/5 of its capacity. To find the amount of water in the second tank, we can multiply the capacity by the fraction:

5000 * 4/5 = 4000 gallons

So, the second tank has 4000 gallons of water.

3. The third tank has a capacity of 3000 gallons and is filled up to half of its capacity. To find the amount of water in the third tank, we can multiply the capacity by 1/2:

3000 * 1/2 = 1500 gallons

So, the third tank has 1500 gallons of water.

Now, let's add up the amount of water in all three tanks:

5250 + 4000 + 1500 = 10750 gallons

Answer: 10750
