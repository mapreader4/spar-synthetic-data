Let's break this down step by step.

Danny drives 8 miles to the first friend's house. Then, he drives half that distance, which is 4 miles, to the second friend's house. Then, he drives 3 times the total distance driven so far, which is 8 + 4 = 12, to get to work. The distance between the second friend's house and work is the total distance driven so far, which is 12 miles. So, the answer is:

Answer: 12
