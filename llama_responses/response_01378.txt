Let's start by letting x be Mel's weight. We know that Brenda weighs 10 pounds more than 3 times Mel's weight. So, Brenda's weight is 10 + 3x. Since Brenda weighs 220 pounds, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

10 + 3x = 220

We can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get:

3x = 210

So, we can divide both sides by 3 to get:

x = 70

So, Mel's weight is 70 pounds.
