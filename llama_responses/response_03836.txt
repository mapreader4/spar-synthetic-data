Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the 3 shirts that are each $15. The cost of these 3 shirts is 3 x 15 = 45 dollars.

Now, let's identify the cost of the remaining 2 shirts. Since the remaining shirts are equal in value, the cost of one of these shirts must be the same as the cost of one of the other. Let's call the cost of one of the remaining shirts x. Then, we know that the cost of the other remaining shirt must also be x. So, we have a system of equations.

We know that the total cost of all 5 shirts is 85 dollars. We can set up an equation to represent this. Let's call it 5x = 85.

We know that 3 of the shirts cost 45, and we know that 2 of the remaining shirts cost x. So, we can set up an equation to represent this.

We know that 45 = 3x, so we can subtract 45 from both sides of the equation to get:

5x = 85 - 45 = 40.

So, the cost of one of the remaining shirts is 40 dollars.
