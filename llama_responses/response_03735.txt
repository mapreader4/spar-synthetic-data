Let's break it down step by step.

Camille saw 3 cardinals. Then, she saw 4 times as many robins as cardinals. So, she saw 4 * 3 = 12 robins.

Next, she saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals. So, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 blue jays.

Finally, she saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. So, she saw 3 * 3 + 1 = 10 sparrows.

Now, let's add up the number of birds she saw: 3 cardinals + 12 robins + 6 blue jays + 10 sparrows = 31.

Answer: 31
