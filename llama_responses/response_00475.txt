Let's start by adding the number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey together. Maggie picked 40 apples, and Kelsey picked 28 apples, so together they picked 40 + 28 = 68 apples. Then, to find out how many apples Layla picked, we need to subtract the total number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey from the total number of apples picked by the three of them. The total number of apples picked by the three of them is 68, and they picked 30 apples. So, to find out how many apples Layla picked, we can subtract 68 - 30 = 38. 

Answer: 38
