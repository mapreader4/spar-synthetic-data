Let's break down the problem step by step.

It takes 1 hour for the refrigerated dough to come to room temperature, which means it will be ready at 7:00 am.

It takes 15 minutes to shape the dough, so the dough will be shaped at 7:15 am.

It takes 2 hours to proof, so the dough will be proofed at 9:15 am.

It takes 30 minutes to bake, so the bread will be baked at 9:45 am.

It takes 15 minutes to cool, so the bread will be cooled at 10:00 am.

The bakery opens at 6:00 am, so the head baker needs to be there at 6:00 am to start working.
