Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by saying that Neil had x games at first. Since Henry gave 5 games to Neil, and now Henry has 4 times as many games as Neil, we can write an equation to represent the situation:

x + 5 = 4x

We can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 4x - 5

We can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get:

x + 5 = 5 + 4x

We can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 5

So, Neil had 5 games at first.
