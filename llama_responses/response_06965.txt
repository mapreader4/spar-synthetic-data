Let's start by identifying the number of packages of paper that Julie purchased. She bought 2 boxes, each containing 250 sheets of paper per package. So, she has a total of 2 x 250 = 500 sheets of paper.

The number of newspapers that Julie can print with the paper that she purchased is the total number of sheets divided by the number of sheets needed to print one newspaper. So, 500 / 25 = 20.
