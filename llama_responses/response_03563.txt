Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the blue basket. It holds 12 bananas and 4 apples, which is a total of 16 fruits.

The red basket holds half as many fruits as the blue basket. So, we need to find half of 16. To find half of 16, we can divide 16 by 2, because 2 is the number that will give us the result when divided by 2.

16 divided by 2 is 8.

So, the red basket holds 8 fruits.

Answer: 8
