Let's break this down step by step.

Carl saved $25 each week for 6 weeks, so he saved a total of 6 x 25 = 150 dollars. On the 7th week, he had to use a third of his saving to pay some bills, which is 150 / 3 = 50 dollars. So, he had 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left. On the 8th week, his dad gave him some extra money for him to buy his dream coat. Since the coat costs $170, the amount his dad gave him is 170 - 100 = 70 dollars. 

Answer: 70
