Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: In the first verse, half of the 30 singers sang. So, half of 30 is 15.

Step 2: In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in. The remaining singers are 30 - 15 = 15, and a third of 15 is 5. So, 5 singers joined the remaining 15 singers.

Step 3: In the final verse, the whole choir sang together. The total number of singers is the sum of the singers from the first and second verses, which is 15 + 15 + 5 = 30.

Answer: 30
