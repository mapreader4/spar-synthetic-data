Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: We know that Simeon used to drink 64 ounces of water in 8-ounce servings. This means that the number of servings he used to drink is:

64 ounces / 8 ounces per serving = 8 servings

Step 2: Now, Simeon drinks his water in 16-ounce servings. To find out how many servings it takes him to drink his water now, we can divide the total amount of water he drinks (64 ounces) by the new serving size (16 ounces):

64 ounces / 16 ounces per serving = 4 servings

Step 3: To find out how many fewer servings it now takes Simeon to drink his water than it used to, we subtract the new number of servings from the old number of servings:

8 servings - 4 servings = 4 servings
