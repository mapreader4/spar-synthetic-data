Let's break this problem down step by step.

On the first day, Jason has 6 fish.

On the second day, the number of fish doubles. So he has 6 * 2 = 12 fish.

On the third day, he takes out one-third of the fish. 12 / 3 = 4 fish are taken out. So he has 12 - 4 = 8 fish left.

On the fifth day, the number of fish doubles again. 8 * 2 = 16 fish.

On the seventh day, he adds 15 fish. So he has 16 + 15 = 31 fish.

So, Jason has 31 fish.

Answer: 31
