Let's break down the problem step by step:

Janet starts with 10 action figures.
She sells 6 of them, so she has 10 - 6 = 4 left.
Her brother gives her a collection of action figures that is twice the size of what she has at the time. So, her brother gives her 2 * 4 = 8 action figures.
Janet now has 4 + 8 = 12 action figures in total.

Answer: 12
