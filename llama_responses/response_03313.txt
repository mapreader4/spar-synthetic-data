Let's break this down step by step.

1. Marco uses a fifth of an ounce of dry tea leaves to brew his morning cup of tea each day. So, he uses 1/5 of an ounce of tea leaves per day.

2. Marco buys tea leaves in boxes of 28 ounces. So, there are 28 ounces of tea leaves in each box.

3. We want to find out how many weeks of daily tea Marco can get from a box. Let's divide the total amount of tea leaves by the amount he uses each day. We know he uses 1/5 of an ounce of tea leaves per day, so we can divide 28 ounces by 1/5.

28 ounces / 1/5 = 56

Answer: 56
