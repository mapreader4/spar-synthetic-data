Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Doug has put out 20 fires.
* Kai has put out 3 times more fires than Doug, so Kai has put out 20 x 3 = 60 fires.
* Eli has put out half the number of fires that Kai has put out, so Eli has put out 60 / 2 = 30 fires.

Now, let's add up the number of fires each person has put out:

* Doug: 20
* Kai: 60
* Eli: 30

Total fires put out: 20 + 60 + 30 = 110

Answer: 110
