Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total revenue from the paper cover version. The number of copies sold is 32,000, and the price is $0.20 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of copies by the price:

32,000 x $0.20 = $6,400

So, the total revenue from the paper cover version is $6,400.

2. Next, we need to find the total revenue from the hardcover version. The number of copies sold is 15,000, and the price is $0.40 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of copies by the price:

15,000 x $0.40 = $6,000

So, the total revenue from the hardcover version is $6,000.

3. The author gets 6% of the total sales of the paper cover version and 12% of the total sales of the hardcover version. To find the author's total earnings, we add the revenue from both versions:

6,400 (paper cover) + 6,000 (hardcover) = 12,400

4. The author's total earnings is $12,400.

Answer: 12,400
