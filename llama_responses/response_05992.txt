Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the total weight of the leaves that fall on the roof per day.

100 leaves weigh 1 pound, so the total weight of leaves that fall per day is 100 pounds.

Step 2: Since the roof can bear 500 pounds of weight, the roof can bear 500 pounds of leaves.

Step 3: Let's find the number of days it will take for the roof to collapse.

The roof can bear 500 pounds of leaves, and 100 pounds of leaves fall every day. To find the number of days it will take for the roof to collapse, we can divide 500 pounds by 1 pound.

500 pounds / 1 pound = 500 days

Answer: 500
