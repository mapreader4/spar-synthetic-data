Let's start by letting X be the amount of money Emily spent on Friday.

On Friday, Emily spent X dollars. On Saturday, she spent twice that amount, which is 2X. On Sunday, she spent three times that amount, which is 3X.

The total amount Emily spent is 120. So, the equation is X + 2X + 3X = 120.

We can combine like terms by adding the X's together. This gives us 4X = 120.

We can solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by 4. So, X = 30.

Answer: 30
