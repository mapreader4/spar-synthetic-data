Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first figure out how much Shaniqua makes for each haircut. She makes $12 for every haircut and $25 for every style. So, for 8 haircuts, she will make 8 * $12 = $96. For 5 styles, she will make 5 * $25 = $125. So, in total, she will make $96 + $125 = $221.
