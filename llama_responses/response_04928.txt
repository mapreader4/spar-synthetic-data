To solve this problem, I will use the concept of exponential growth. Since the number of swans doubles every 2 years, I can model this with the equation:

Let x be the number of swans after 10 years. Then, the number of swans after 2 years will be 2x. To find the number of swans after 10 years, I will multiply 2 to the power of 5 (since 10 is 2 x 5):

x = 15 * 2^5

x = 15 * 32

x = 480

Answer: 480
