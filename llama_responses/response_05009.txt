Let's break this down step by step.

The total cost of the book is $16.
The total cost of the three binders is 3 x $2 = $6.
The total cost of the six notebooks is 6 x $1 = $6.
The total cost of all the items is the sum of the costs of each item. So, the total cost is:

$16 + $6 + $6 = $28.

Answer: 28
