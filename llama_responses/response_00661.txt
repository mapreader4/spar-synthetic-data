Let's think step by step. If there are 30 nuts in the bowl and 5/6 of them were eaten, we want to find the number of nuts that were eaten. We know that 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, and we want to find the total number of nuts. To do this, we can multiply 5 by 30, which gives us the total number of nuts eaten. This is because 5/6 of 30 is the same as 5/6 x 30. So, 5 x 30 = 25.
