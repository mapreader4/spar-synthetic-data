Let's break this problem down step by step.

Larry spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog. That is 30 minutes, so he spends 30 minutes per day on this activity.

He also spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog. An hour is 60 minutes, so a fifth of an hour is 60 / 5 = 12 minutes.

So, the total time spent on his dog each day is 30 + 12 = 42 minutes.

Answer: 42
