Let's start by using the information given to create an equation to represent the given information.

Let's say Kyle's age is x.

Since Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, we can write an equation: x - 5 = Julian's age.

Since Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick, we can write another equation: Julian's age = Frederick's age - 20.

We know Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson, so Frederick's age = 2 x Tyson's age.

Tyson is 20, so Frederick's age = 2 x 20 = 40.

Now, we can substitute Frederick's age into the equation for Julian's age: Julian's age = 40 - 20 = 20.

So, Kyle's age is 20 + 5 = 25.

Answer: 25
