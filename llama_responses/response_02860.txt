Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The number of pizzas bought is 6.
* The number of games played is 8.
* A large pizza has 12 slices.

Since Mr. Mitchell bought 6 pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices: 6 x 12 = 72 slices.

Now, the total number of goals scored by the team is equal to the total number of slices, which is 72.

To find the average number of goals scored per game, we need to divide the total number of goals by the number of games played. So, we divide 72 by 8:

72 รท 8 = 9

Answer: 9
