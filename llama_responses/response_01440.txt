Let's break it down step by step.

The team played a total of 20 games, and won 14 games. That means they lost 20 - 14 = 6 games. So, they lost 6 games.

They earned 3 points for each of the 14 games they won, which is 3 x 14 = 42 points. They earned 1 point for each of the 6 games they drew, which is 1 x 6 = 6 points. They earned 0 points for each of the 6 games they lost, which is 0 x 6 = 0 points.

So, the total points they earned are 42 + 6 = 48.

Answer: 48
