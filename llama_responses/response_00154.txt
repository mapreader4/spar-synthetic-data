Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of money Ariella's son has in his savings account. Ariella has $200 more than Daniella has, so we can say that Ariella's son has $200 + $400 = $600 in his savings account.

Since the account earns simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum, we need to find the amount of interest earned in one year. To do this, we can multiply the principal amount by the rate of interest, which is 0.1 (10% in decimal form). In this case, we have:

$600 * 0.1 = $60

So, in one year, Ariella's son will earn $60 in interest. Since the interest is compounded annually, we need to multiply the interest earned in one year by the number of years. In this case, we have 2 years. So, we multiply the interest earned in one year by 2:

$60 * 2 = $120

So, after two years, Ariella's son will have a total of $600 + $120 = $720 in his savings account.
