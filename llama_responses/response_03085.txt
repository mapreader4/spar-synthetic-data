Let's start by using the information that Caden has three times as many pennies as he does nickels. Since he has 120 pennies, and pennies are worth $0.01 each, we can set up an equation to represent the number of pennies he has:

Let x be the number of nickels he has. Since he has three times as many pennies as he does nickels, he has 3x pennies. Since he has 120 pennies, we can set up the equation:

3x = 120

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 120 รท 3
x = 40

So, he has 40 nickels. Since each nickel is worth $0.05, he has:

40 x $0.05
$2.00

Since he has five times as many nickels as he does dimes, and he has 40 nickels, he has 5x the number of dimes:

5x

Since he has twice as many quarters as he does dimes, and he has 5x dimes, he has 2(5x) quarters:

2(5x)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, he has:

2(5x) x $0.25
$1.25x

Since he has 2(5x) quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can simplify the expression:

$1.25x

Since he has four jars of coins, and one jar of pennies, one jar of nickels, one jar of dimes, and one jar of quarters, we can combine the values of all the coins to get the total amount of money he has:

$2.00 + $1.25x

Since he has 120 pennies, which is equal to $1.20, we can add it to the total:

$2.00 + $1.20
$3.20

Answer: 320
