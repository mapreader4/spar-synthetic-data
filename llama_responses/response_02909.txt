Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Alan bought 20 eggs at $2 per egg. So, the total cost of the eggs is:

20 eggs * $2 per egg = 20 * 2 = $40

Next, we know that Alan bought 6 chickens for $8 per chicken. So, the total cost of the chickens is:

6 chickens * $8 per chicken = 6 * 8 = $48

Now, we need to add the cost of the eggs and the cost of the chickens to get the total amount of money spent at the market:

$40 + $48 = $88

Answer: 88
