Let's break it down step by step.

John has made $250 in 10 days, so he makes $25 per day.  To make twice this amount, he needs to make $50 per day.  So, we need to find out how many days he needs to work to make $50 per day.

Let's set up an equation.  Let $d$ be the number of days John needs to work to make $50 per day.  Then, we can set up an equation:

$25 * 10 = 250$

$50 * d = 50 * x$

We can solve for $d$ by dividing both sides by 50:

$\frac{250}{25} = d$

$d = 10$

So, John needs to work for 10 more days to make $50 per day.  Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 10
