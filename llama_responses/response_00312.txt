Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the fact that an emu has two legs. So, if we have a total of 60 heads in the flock, then each head must have two legs. We know that each head has two legs.

So, if we divide the total number of legs by 2, we can get the number of heads:

60 legs รท 2 = 30

So, there are 30 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.
