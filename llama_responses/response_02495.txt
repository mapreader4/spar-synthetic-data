Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the amount of water the traveler drank. He drank 32 ounces of water initially.

Then, he drank seven times as much as he did, so we multiply 32 ounces by 7.

32 ounces * 7 = 224 ounces

Now, there are 128 ounces in a gallon. To find the number of gallons, we divide 224 ounces by 128.

224 รท 128 = 1.75

So, the answer is 1.75 gallons.
