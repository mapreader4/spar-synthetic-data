Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of bugs eaten by each animal:

1. Gecko: 12 bugs
2. Lizard: 12 / 2 = 6 bugs (since lizard eats half as many bugs as the gecko)
3. Frog: 6 * 3 = 18 bugs (since frog eats 3 times as many bugs as the lizard)
4. Toad: 18 + 50% = 27 bugs (since toad eats 50% more bugs than the frog)

Now, let's add up the number of bugs eaten by each animal:

12 + 6 + 18 + 27 = 43

Answer: 43
