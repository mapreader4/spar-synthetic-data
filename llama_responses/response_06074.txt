Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of Legos James has, which is 500.

James uses half of the Legos, which is 500 / 2 = 250, to build the castle. So, the number of Legos used is 250.

James is told to put the rest away, which is the remaining 250 - 5 = 245. 

So, the number of Legos in the box at the end is 245.
