Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how much money Jack will have in his piggy bank after 8 weeks. He gets an allowance of $10 a week. So, after 8 weeks, he will have 8 x $10 = $80.

Now, let's find out how much of this money he will put into his piggy bank. He puts half of his allowance into his piggy bank every week. So, half of $10 is $5. So, in 8 weeks, he will put 8 x $5 = $40 into his piggy bank.

Now, let's find out how much he will have in his piggy bank. He starts with $43 and adds $40. So, his total amount in his piggy bank will be $43 + $40 = $83.
