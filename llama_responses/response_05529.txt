Let's start by using the information given in the problem. Angela has half as many insects as Jacob, so let's say Jacob has 2x insects. Dean has 5 times as many insects as Jacob, so Dean has 10 insects. So, if Dean has 10 insects, and Jacob has 2x insects, Angela has 10/2 insects. 10/2 = 5. So, Angela has 5 insects.
