Let's break this down step by step.

Wickham invites 30 people to his party. Half of 30 is 15. So, 15 people bring a plus one, which means 15 + 15 = 30 more people are coming. In total, 30 + 30 = 60 people are attending the party.

Since Wickham wants to serve a 3-course meal, he will need a plate for each course. So, he needs 3 plates for each of the 60 guests. 3 x 60 = 180 plates.

Answer: 180
