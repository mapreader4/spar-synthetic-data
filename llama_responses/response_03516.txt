Let's break down the problem step by step.

The class has $90 in total to contribute for the school activity. They have $14 in class funds and they want to use it to lessen the contribution of each student. This means that the $14 will be subtracted from the total $90.

To find the new total, we subtract $14 from $90:

$90 - $14 = $76

Now, the remaining $76 will be divided among 19 students. To find the amount each student will contribute, we divide $76 by 19:

$76 รท 19 = $4
