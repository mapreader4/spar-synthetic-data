Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the given information to find the total number of spruces and pines. We know that spruces make up 10% of the total number of trees, and pines make up 13%. We can set up an equation to represent this:

10% + 13% = 23%

Since there are 4000 trees in total, we can multiply the total number of trees by 23% to find the number of spruces and pines combined:

4000 * 0.23 = 920

Now, we know that the number of oaks is equal to the number of spruces and pines combined. So, we can subtract the number of spruces and pines from the total number of trees to find the number of oaks:

4000 - 920 = 3080

Now, we can find the number of birches by subtracting the total number of oaks, spruces, and pines from the total number of trees:

4000 - 3080 - 920 = 0

Wait, that's not an integer answer! Let's check our work. Let's add up the number of oaks, spruces, and pines to see if it adds up to 4000:

3080 + 920 = 4000

Yes, it does! So, the number of birches is actually 0, which doesn't make sense. This is because the problem statement mentioned that there are as many oaks as spruces and pines put together, but we found that the number of oaks is 3080, which is more than the combined number of spruces and pines. This means that the statement is incorrect, and we cannot find the correct number of birches.
