Let's break this down step by step.

Tom needs 500 pounds of flour, which is 500 / 50 = 10 bags of flour. Each bag costs $20, so the cost of flour is 10 x 20 = $200. Tom also needs 10 pounds of salt, which costs 10 x.2 = $2. The total cost of flour and salt is 200 + 2 = $202. Tom spends $1000 promoting everything. He then sells 500 tickets for $20 each, so the total revenue is 500 x 20 = $1000. So, Tom makes $1000 - $202 = $798. 

Answer: 798
