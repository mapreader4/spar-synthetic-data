Let's think step by step!

Let's start by identifying the number of doughnuts initially available: 50.

Then, we know that each of the 19 staff members ate 2 doughnuts. So, the total number of doughnuts eaten is 19 x 2 = 38.

Now, let's subtract the number of doughnuts eaten from the initial total:

50 - 38 = 12

So, there are 12 doughnuts left.
