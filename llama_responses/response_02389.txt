Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total number of cards in the deck. A standard deck of cards has 52 cards, and we are removing the face cards (Jack, Queen, King, Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) and the 8's, leaving us with 44 cards.

2. Mark picks a card at random and then replaces it 36 times. This means he is effectively removing 36 cards from the deck.

3. After removing 36 cards, there are 44 cards left in the deck. Since Mark is picking cards randomly, we can assume that the probability of picking a card that is red and has a number divisible by 3 is the same as the probability of picking any card that is red and has a number divisible by 3.

4. The cards that have a number divisible by 3 in a standard deck are 3, 6, 9, and 12. Since there are 4 cards that are red and have a number divisible by 3, the probability of picking one of these cards is 4/44.

5. Since Mark picks the cards randomly, the probability of picking a card that is red and has a number divisible by 3 is 4/44.
