Let's start by finding out how many strawberries Karlee has. She has 3/5 as many strawberries as grapes, and she has 100 grapes. So, she has 3/5 * 100 = 60 strawberries.

Then, she gives 1/5 of each fruit to each of her friends. So, she gives 1/5 of the 60 strawberries to each of her friends, which is 12 strawberries to each friend. Since she has 2 friends, she gives 12 * 2 = 24 strawberries in total. So, she has 60 - 24 = 36 strawberries left.

Now, she has 100 grapes, and she gives 1/5 of them to each of her friends, which is 20 grapes to each friend. So, she gives 20 * 2 = 40 grapes to her friends. So, she has 100 - 40 = 60 grapes left.

In total, Karlee has 36 strawberries and 60 grapes. So, the total number of fruits she has left is 36 + 60 = 96.
