Let's break it down step by step:

1. Anna spent $0.95 on breakfast (bagel and orange juice).
2. At lunch, Anna spent $4.65 on a sandwich and $1.15 on a carton of milk.
3. To find the total amount spent on lunch, we add the cost of the sandwich and the milk: $4.65 + $1.15 = $5.80.
4. To find the difference in cost between breakfast and lunch, we subtract the cost of breakfast from the cost of lunch: $5.80 - $0.95 = $4.85.

Answer: 4.85
