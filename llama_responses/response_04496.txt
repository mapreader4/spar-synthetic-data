Let's break it down step by step.

Sabina has $10,000 saved for her first year. The cost of tuition is $30,000. So, the amount of tuition that is not covered by her savings is $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000. The grant will cover 40% of the remainder, so the amount of tuition covered by the grant is 0.4 * $20,000 = $8,000. To find out how much Sabina needs to apply for to receive a loan that will cover her tuition, we need to subtract the amount covered by the grant from the remainder: $20,000 - $8,000 = $12,000.

Answer: 12000
