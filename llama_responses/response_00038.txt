Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: We know that Artemis's mom drinks 8 ounces of tea. This means that for every 1 ounce of tea, her mom drinks 8 ounces of tea.

Step 2: The party has 12 people. Each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. This means that the total amount of tea needed for the party is 12 * 6 = 72 ounces.

Step 3: We know that for every 1 ounce of tea, Artemis's mom drinks 8 ounces of tea. So, to get the total amount of tea needed, we can divide 72 ounces by 8. This gives us the number of times Artemis needs to use the tea ratio: 72 รท 8 = 9.

Answer: 9
