To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of cars Oprah has left after giving away some cars. Let's call this number x.

The number of cars Oprah gives away each year is 50, so the number of years it will take to give away 3500 - 500 cars is:

3500 - 500 = 2900

To find the number of years it will take to give away 2900 cars, we can divide 2900 by the number of cars Oprah gives away each year:

2900 รท 50 = 58

Answer: 58
