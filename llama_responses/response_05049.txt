Let's start by thinking step by step.

Let's let the number be x. The number, when multiplied by 3, is three less than twice 51. So, we can set up the equation as:

3x = 2(51) - 3

Now, we need to solve for x. We can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = (2(51) - 3) / 3

Now, we can simplify the right side of the equation by multiplying 2 and 51:

x = (102 - 3) / 3

x = 33

So, the number is 33.
