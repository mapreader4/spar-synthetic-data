Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Jason has 2 tattoos on each of his arms, and 3 tattoos on each of his legs. So, he has a total of 2 * 2 + 3 * 2 = 8 tattoos. We are told that Adam has three more than twice as many tattoos as Jason, so we need to find out how many times 8 is added to get Adam's total number of tattoos.

To do this, we can add 8 to itself, which is the same as multiplying it by 2. So, 8 * 2 = 16. Therefore, Adam has 16 tattoos.
