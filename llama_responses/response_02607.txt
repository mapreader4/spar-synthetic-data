Let's break this problem down step by step.

John starts with 8 puppies.

He gives away half of them.  Half of 8 is 4.  So, he has 8 - 4 = 4 puppies left.

He keeps one of the remaining puppies.  So, he now has 4 - 1 = 3 puppies.

He sells each of the remaining puppies for $600.  So, he sells 3 x 600 = 1800.

He had to give the owner of the stud $300.  So, he has 1800 - 300 = 1500.

So, John profits 1500.
