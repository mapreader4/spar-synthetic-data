To find the total cost of the tickets, I need to multiply the cost of the concert ticket by the number of tickets, which is 1 plus 5, or 6 tickets. The total cost of the tickets is 181 * 6 = 1081. Jenna earns 18 dollars per hour, and she works 30 hours a week. To find her monthly salary, I need to multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a week, which is 30 * 18 = 540. To find the percentage of her monthly salary that she spends on this outing, I need to divide the cost of the tickets by her monthly salary, which is 1081 / 540. 1081 / 540 = 2.01.
