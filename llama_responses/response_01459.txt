Let's break this down step by step:

1. There are 7 days in a week.

2. Each person drinks 2 cups of coffee per day, so the total number of cups per week is 2 * 7 = 14.

3. Each cup of coffee is 0.5 ounces, so the total amount of ounces of coffee per week is 14 * 0.5 = 7.

4. The cost of 1 ounce of coffee is $1.25, so the cost of 7 ounces of coffee is 7 * 1.25 = $8.75.

Answer: 8.75
