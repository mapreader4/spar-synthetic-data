Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the amount Jake has to pay off:

Jake owed $100 and paid $40.  So, he has $100 - $40 = $60 left to pay.

Now, let's find the number of hours Jake has to work to pay off the remaining amount.

Jake gets paid $15 per hour.  So, to find the number of hours, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

$60 / $15 = 4 hours.

So, Jake has to work 4 hours to pay off the remaining amount.
