Let's solve this problem step by step.

There are 35 bottles of milk on the grocery store shelf initially.
Jason buys 5 bottles of milk, so the number of bottles of milk left is 35 - 5 = 30.
Then Harry buys 6 more bottles of milk, so the number of bottles of milk left is 30 - 6 = 24.

Answer: 24
