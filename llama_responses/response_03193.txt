Let's break this down step by step.

It takes 40 minutes to freeze ice cubes. So, to freeze 5 smoothies, we need to multiply 40 minutes by 5, which is 200 minutes.

It takes 3 minutes to make one smoothie. So, to make 5 smoothies, we need to multiply 3 minutes by 5, which is 15 minutes.

Now, to make 5 smoothies, we need to add the time it takes to freeze the ice cubes (200 minutes) to the time it takes to make each smoothie (15 minutes). This is 200 + 15 = 215 minutes.

So, the answer is: Answer: 215.
