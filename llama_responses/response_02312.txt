Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Lisa has $1200.
* Her mother gave her 3/5 of what she had saved, so her mother gave her 1200 * 3/5 = 720.
* Her brother gave her twice the amount her mother gave her, so her brother gave her 2 * 720 = 1440.
* The total amount her mother and brother gave her is 720 + 1440 = 2160.
* Lisa still has $400 less, so the price of the gift she wanted to buy is 1200 - 400 = 800.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 800
