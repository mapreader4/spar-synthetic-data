Let's start by identifying the number of fish each person has. We know that Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, and Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy. So, Tony has 3 x 10 = 30 fish, since Billy has 10 fish. Sarah has 5 more than Tony, so Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.

The total number of fish the 4 people have is the sum of the number of fish each person has: 10 + 30 + 35 = 75.
