Let the length of the entire wire be x. Then, we can set up a proportion to find the length of the longer piece. We have the ratio 7:3:2, so we can write the following equation:

(3/8) * x = 16

Now, we can multiply both sides by 8 to get:

3x = 16 * 8
3x = 128

x = 128 / 3
x = 42.67

So, the length of the entire wire before it was cut is 42.67 cm.
