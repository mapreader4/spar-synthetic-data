Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Darlene's car gets 20 miles/gallon. This means that 1 gallon of gas in Darlene's car will take her 20 miles.

We are asked to find out how many gallons Martha's car requires to make a 300-mile trip. Since Martha's car gets half as many miles per gallon as Darlene's car, we know that Martha's car gets 10 miles/gallon.

To find the number of gallons Martha's car requires to make a 300-mile trip, we need to divide 300 miles by the number of miles per gallon. So, we do that:

300 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 30 gallons

Answer: 30
