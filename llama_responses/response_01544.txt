Let's start by first calculating the amount of money Ben will spend on the kitchen. 1/22 of the 1496 dollars is 67. Then, he will spend 1/4 of the 1496 dollars on holidays, which is 374 dollars. Then, he will spend 1/8 of the 1496 dollars on Christmas gifts for his 3 children, which is 187 dollars. The total amount spent is 67 + 374 + 187 = 528. To find the amount of money he will have left, we subtract the total spent from the 1496, so 1496 - 528 = 968. The answer is: Answer: 968.
