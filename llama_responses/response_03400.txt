Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know:

1. Rodney can lift some amount, which we will call "R".
2. Roger can lift twice as much as Rodney, so Rodney can lift 2R.
3. Roger can lift 7 pounds less than 4 times the amount that Ron can lift, which we will call "R" as well.  So, Roger can lift 4R - 7.
4. Ron can lift R.
5. We know that Rodney, Roger and Ron can lift a combined weight of 239 pounds.

Now, let's combine the information.

We know that Rodney can lift 2R, and Roger can lift 4R - 7, so we can write an equation for Rodney's lift as:

2R = 4R - 7

We can solve for R by adding 7 to both sides of the equation:

2R = 4R - 7
2R + 7 = 4R

Now, we can solve for R:

2R + 7 = 4R
2R = 4R - 7 + 7
2R = 4R + 7
4R = 4R

So, Rodney can lift 4R.

We can now use this information to solve for Rodney's lift. Rodney can lift 2R, and we know that 2R = 4R - 7. So, Rodney can lift 4R - 7 = 2R.

2R = 4R - 7
2R = 4R - 7
4R - 7 = 2R
2R = 2R

So, Rodney can lift 2R.

The answer is: Answer: 2
