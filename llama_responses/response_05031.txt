Let's start by calculating the time Gretchen spends sitting. If she spends 6 hours working at her desk, that is equal to 360 minutes. Since she should spend 10 minutes walking for every 90 minutes sitting, that means that she should spend 60 minutes walking for every 90 minutes sitting. 360 minutes is equal to 6 hours, which is 10 x 36 minutes. Since 10 x 36 minutes is equal to 360 minutes, Gretchen should spend 360 minutes walking. Since 360 minutes is equal to 6 hours, we can conclude that Gretchen will spend 6 hours walking.
