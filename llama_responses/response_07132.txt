Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Each tray has 20 cupcakes.
* Each cupcake was sold for $2.
* 3/5 of the cupcakes were sold.

We know that 3/5 of the cupcakes were sold, which means that 3/5 * 20 = 12 cupcakes were sold.

The number of cupcakes left unsold is 20 - 12 = 8. 

Since each cupcake was sold for $2, the total amount earned from selling 12 cupcakes is 12 * 2 = 24. 

So, Anna earned $24 from selling the 12 cupcakes.
