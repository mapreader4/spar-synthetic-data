Let's start by using the information given. We know that Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily did. This means that if Emily sold x oranges, then Alice sold 2x oranges.

We are also given that in total, they sold 180 oranges. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + x = 180

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 180 / 2
x = 90

Answer: 90
