Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian. This means that Rodney has 35 + x dollars, where x is the amount of money Ian has. We know that Ian has half as much money as Jessica has, so Ian has x/2 dollars. So, we can set up an equation:

x = 2 * (Jessica's money) / 2

We know that Jessica has 100 dollars, so we can plug that in:

x = 2 * 100 / 2
x = 100 / 2
x = 50

So, Ian has 50 dollars. Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian, which means Rodney has 35 + 50 = 85 dollars.

Answer: 35
