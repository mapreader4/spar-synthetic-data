Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan. So, if Megan has 5 pieces of candy, Mary must also have 5 pieces of candy. We can write this as an equation: 3x = 5.

Then, Mary adds 10 more pieces of candy to her collection. So, we can add 10 to 5 to find the total amount of candy Mary has. 5 + 10 = 15.

So, Mary has 15 pieces of candy in total.
