Let's break it down step by step:

Let x be the cost of the hockey pads.

Inez has 150 dollars initially. She spends one-half of that on hockey skates. So, she spends 150 / 2 = 75 dollars on the skates.

She has 150 - 75 = 75 dollars remaining.

So, the cost of the hockey pads is 75 dollars.
