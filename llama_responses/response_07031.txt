Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the total amount of money Darwin had, which is 600.

He spent 1/3 of it on gas for his car. This means he spent 600/3 = 200 on gas for his car.

Now, he has 600 - 200 = 400 left.

Then, he spent 1/4 of what was left on food. 1/4 of 400 is 400/4 = 100.

So, he spent 100 on food.

Now, he has 400 - 100 = 300 left.

So, the answer is: Answer: 300
