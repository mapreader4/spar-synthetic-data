Let's break it down step by step.

James pays for the tickets, which costs 2 x $100 = $200.

Then he pays for the dinner, which costs $120.

Next, he leaves a 30% tip, which is 0.3 x $120 = $36.

Then, he charts a limo for 6 hours, which costs 6 x $80 = $480.

Adding all of these up, the total cost is 200 + 120 + 36 + 480 = $736.
