Let's break this problem down step by step.

Josh has $300 in his wallet initially. He has $2000 invested in the business, so his total worth is $1300.

The business's stock price rises 30%. So, the new value of the business is 130% of the original value. 130% of 2000 is 2600. The total value of the business is now 2600.

Josh sells all of his stocks. He gets 2600 dollars from the sale of the stocks.

Adding the 2600 to his initial 300 dollars in his wallet, he now has 2600 + 300 = 2900 dollars.

Answer: 2900.
