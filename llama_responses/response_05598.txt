Let's start by saying what we know. We know that Mary has 4 times as many towels as Frances does. So, if Mary has 24 towels, Frances has 24 / 4 = 6 towels. The total weight of their towels is 60 pounds. So, we know that Mary's 24 towels and Frances's 6 towels weigh 24 + 6 = 30 pounds. But the question asks for Frances's towels in ounces. We know that 60 pounds is equal to 240 ounces. So, Frances's towels weigh 240 / 30 = 8 ounces. 

Answer: 8
