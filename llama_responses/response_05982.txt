To find the total number of hours Ralph watches TV in one week, we can multiply the number of hours he watches TV each day by the number of days in the week. Ralph watches TV for 4 hours a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total hours he watches TV in the first 5 days is 4 * 5 = 20 hours. He watches TV for 6 hours a day on Saturday and Sunday, which is 2 days. So, the total hours he watches TV in the last 2 days is 6 * 2 = 12 hours. The total number of hours Ralph watches TV in one week is 20 + 12 = 32 hours. Answer: 32
