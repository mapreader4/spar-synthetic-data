Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Sally starts with 32 cherry sours.
2. She then gets a scoop of lemon sours, and the ratio of cherry sours to lemon sours is 4:5. This means that for every 4 cherry sours, there are 5 lemon sours. Let's call the number of lemon sours x. Then, we can set up the equation:

32 / 4 = x / 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

32 * 5 = x

x = 160 / 4

x = 40

So Sally has 40 lemon sours.

3. Then, she gets a scoop of orange sours, and they make up 25% of the sours in the bag. To find the total number of sours, we can add the number of cherry sours, lemon sours, and orange sours:

Total sours = Cherry sours + Lemon sours + Orange sours

= 32 + 40 + Orange sours

We don't know the exact number of orange sours yet, but we know it's 25% of the total. Let's call the total number of sours y. Then, we can set up the equation:

Orange sours = 0.25y

We know that the total number of orange sours is 25% of the total, so we can set up the equation:

Orange sours = 0.25y

Now we can substitute this into the equation for the total number of sours:

Total sours = 32 + 40 + 0.25y

To find the total number of sours, we can add the number of cherry sours, lemon sours, and orange sours:

Total sours = 72 + 0.25y

4. To find the total number of sours, we can solve for y:

y = Total sours - 72

y = 72 + 0.25y

y - 0.25y = 72

0.75y = 72

y = 96

So the total number of sours is 96.

Answer: 96
