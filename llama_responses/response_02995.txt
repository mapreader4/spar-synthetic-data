Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The total number of trees on the farm is 400.
* Amiyah cuts 20% of the trees. To find the number of trees cut, we can multiply the total number of trees by the percentage: 400 * 0.20 = 80.

So, Amiyah cuts 80 trees.

To find the total number of trees remaining, we subtract the number of trees cut from the total number of trees: 400 - 80 = 320.

So, the total number of trees on the farm after Amiyah cuts 20% is 320.

Answer: 320
