Let's work step by step. We know Noemi lost $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack. So, we can subtract the amount she lost on roulette from the total amount she had in her purse.

Noemi had $800 in her purse initially. She lost $400 on roulette, so we subtract that from $800, and we get $400. Then, she lost $500 on blackjack, so we subtract that from $400 and we get $200. So, Noemi had $200 in her purse after she lost money on roulette and blackjack.

So, she started with $800 - $200 = $600.
