Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Vins rides his bike 6 miles to school and back, which is a total of 12 miles.
2. He does this 5 times this week, so the total distance he rode to school and back is 5 x 12 = 60 miles.
3. He also rides his bike a different route that is 7 miles long, which is an additional distance.
4. The total distance Vins rode his bike this week is the sum of these two distances: 60 miles + 7 miles = 67 miles.

Answer: 67
