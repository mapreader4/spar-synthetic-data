Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the cost of the pencil is x.

The cost of the pen is twice as much as the pencil, so we can set up an equation:

Pen = 2 * Pencil

We know that the total cost of the pen and pencil is 6, so we can set up another equation:

Pen + Pencil = 6

We can substitute the equation we made earlier into this equation:

2 * Pencil + Pencil = 6

We can subtract Pencil from both sides of the equation to get:

2 * Pencil = 6 - Pencil

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

Pencil = 3

So, the cost of the pencil is 3.
