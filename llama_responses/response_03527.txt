Let's break down the problem step by step.

Marsha has to drive 10 miles to deliver her first package. Then she has to drive 28 miles to deliver her second package. She has to drive half that distance to deliver her third package, so half of 28 is 14 miles. So, the total distance she has to drive is 10 + 28 + 14 = 52 miles.

She gets paid 104 dollars for the day. To find out how much she gets paid per mile, we can divide the total amount of money she gets paid by the total distance she drives. So, we do 104 รท 52 = 2. The answer is:
