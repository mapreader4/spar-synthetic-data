Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the cost of the scoops for Mr. and Mrs. Martin:

* 2 regular scoops (1 for each) = 2 x $4 = $8

Next, let's find the cost of the scoops for the 2 children:

* 2 kiddie scoops (1 for each) = 2 x $3 = $6

Next, let's find the cost of the scoops for the 3 teenage children:

* 3 double scoops (1 for each) = 3 x $6 = $18

Now, let's add up the total cost for the scoops:

$8 (for Mr. and Mrs. Martin) + $6 (for the 2 children) + $18 (for the 3 teenage children) = $32

Answer: 32
