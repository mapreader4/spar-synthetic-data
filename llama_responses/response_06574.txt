Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: We know that Jack borrowed  $1200 from Jill. This is the amount borrowed.

Step 2: We know that the interest rate is 10%. This means that Jack will need to pay back 10% of the borrowed amount.

Step 3: To find the amount of interest, we can multiply the borrowed amount by the interest rate.

1200 * 0.10 = 120

Step 4: We add the interest to the borrowed amount to find the total amount Jack needs to pay back.

1200 + 120 = 1320

Answer: 1320
