Let's break it down step by step.

First, Felicia needs 2 cups of flour. She has a 1/4 cup scoop. To get 2 cups, she will need to fill the scoop 8 times. So, 8 x 1/4 = 2.

Next, she needs a cup of white sugar. She has a 1/4 cup scoop. To get 1 cup, she will need to fill the scoop 4 times. So, 4 x 1/4 = 1.

Next, she needs 1/2 cup of brown sugar. She has a 1/4 cup scoop. To get 1/2, she will need to fill the scoop 2 times. So, 2 x 1/4 = 0.5.

Finally, she needs 1/2 cup of oil. She has a 1/4 cup scoop. To get 1/2, she will need to fill the scoop 2 times. So, 2 x 1/4 = 0.5.

In total, Felicia needs to fill the scoop 8 + 4 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 12.5 times. The answer is:
