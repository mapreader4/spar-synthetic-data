Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of macarons Emma originally had: 10 pieces.

She bought 3 dozens of macarons, which is 3 x 12 = 36 pieces.

Adding the 36 pieces to the 10 pieces she already had, Emma now has a total of 46 pieces of macarons.

Since 15 pieces are left over, we can subtract the 15 from the total 46 pieces: 46 - 15 = 31.

So, the answer is: Answer: 31.
