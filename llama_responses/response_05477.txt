Let's break down the problem step by step.

Regina has 20 cows and 4 times more pigs. To find the number of pigs, we multiply 20 by 4 to get 80 pigs. So, Regina has 20 cows and 80 pigs in total.

If she sells all the animals, she would earn $800 for each cow, so she would earn 20 x $800 = $16,000 for the cows. And she would earn $400 for each pig, so she would earn 80 x $400 = $32,000 for the pigs.

To find the total amount of money Regina would earn, we add the amount for the cows and the amount for the pigs. 16,000 + 32,000 = 48,000.

Answer: 48000
