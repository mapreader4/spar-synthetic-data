Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start with what we know:

* Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.
* Rhonda caught x necklaces.
* Boudreaux caught half as many necklaces as did Rhonda, which is x/2.
* Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.

We can write an equation to represent the situation:

4 = 3x - x

We know that Rhonda caught x necklaces. So, we can substitute x into the equation:

4 = 3x - x
x = 3x - x
x = 4

We can add x to both sides of the equation to get:

4 + x = 4
x = 4

So, Latch caught 4 necklaces.
