Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the wholesale price of the pants is x.

The retail price is 36 dollars. The retail price is 1.8 times the wholesale price. So, we can set up an equation.

36 = 1.8x

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 1.8.

x = 36 / 1.8

x = 20

The wholesale price is 20 dollars.
