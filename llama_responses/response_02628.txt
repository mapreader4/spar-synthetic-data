Let's break it down step by step.

John got 50 dollars from each of his 4 grandparents, so he got a total of 50 * 4 = 200 dollars.

The birds cost 20 dollars each, so the total cost of the birds is 20 * x, where x is the number of birds. Since the total cost is 200, we can set up an equation: 20x = 200.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 200 / 20 = 10.

So, the number of birds John bought is 10.
