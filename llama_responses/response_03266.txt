Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of feathers that the goose has. The goose has approximately 3600 feathers. Since Miranda needs 2 pounds of feathers for each pillow, and a pound of feathers is approximately 300 feathers, we can find the total number of pillows she can stuff by dividing 3600 feathers by 300.

3600 รท 300 = 12

So, Miranda can stuff 12 pillows.

Answer: 12
