Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost per person for the 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides. We can divide the total cost by the number of people it serves, which is 6.

$12.00 รท 6 = $2.00 per person

So the cost per person is $2.00.

Next, we need to find the cost to feed 36 people. We can multiply the cost per person by the number of people.

$2.00 x 36 = $72.00

So, the total cost to feed 36 people would be $72.00.
