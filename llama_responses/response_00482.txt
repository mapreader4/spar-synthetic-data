Let's break this down step by step.

Ian does 5 laps around the complex every night. Each lap is 100 feet. So, the total distance he covers every night is 5 * 100 = 500 feet.

It takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie. To find how many calories Ian burns, we need to divide the total distance by 25.

500 feet / 25 = 20.

So, it takes 20 feet of jogging to burn 1 calorie. To find the total calories burned in 5 days, we multiply the calories burned per 20 feet by the total distance he covers in 5 days.

20 * 5 = 100.

Answer: 100
