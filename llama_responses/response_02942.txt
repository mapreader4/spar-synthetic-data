Let's break this down step by step.

1. The monthly payment is $150.00.
2. The number of months is 5 years, which is 60 months (5 * 12).
3. The total amount financed is the monthly payment multiplied by the number of months, so:

$150.00 * 60 = $9,000.00

So, Gunther financed the tractor for $9,000.00.
