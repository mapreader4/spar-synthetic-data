Let's start by finding the difference in Kendra's earnings in 2015 and 2014. The problem says Kendra made 20% more than Laurel in 2015. If Laurel made 30000 in 2014, then Kendra made 30000 + 20% of 30000 = 36000 in 2015.

The difference in Kendra's earnings is 36000 - 8000 = 18800.

Now, we need to find Kendra's total earnings in the two years. The total earnings are the sum of the earnings in 2014 and 2015. The total earnings are 8000 + 36000 = 41600.
