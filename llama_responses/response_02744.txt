Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total distance the potato will travel. Since a football field is 200 yards long, we need to convert yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 200 yards is 600 feet. Since the dog runs at a rate of 400 feet per minute, we need to find the time it will take to cover the total distance.

The total distance the potato will travel is 600 feet. The time it will take to cover this distance is the total distance divided by the rate:

600 feet / 400 feet/minute = 1.5 minutes

Answer: 1.5
