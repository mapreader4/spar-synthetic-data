Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the capacity of each glass is x ounces. Then, the total capacity of the 10 glasses is 10x. Since the glasses are 4/5 full of water, that means that the total water needed to fill the glasses is 4/5 of the total capacity of the glasses. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

10x * 4/5 = 4x.

Now, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 5:

4x = 10 * 4/5
4x = 40/5
4x = 8

So, the answer is: Answer: 8
