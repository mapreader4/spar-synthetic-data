Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Megan spends 2 hours preparing as many dishes as she can.  This means that she will make 2 hours * (60 minutes per hour) / 20 minutes per dish = 12 dishes.

2. Each dish feeds 5 people.  So, the total number of people she can feed is 12 * 5 = 60 people.

Answer: 60
