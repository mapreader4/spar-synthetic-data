Let's start by identifying the number of planks Colbert already has. He has a quarter of the total planks, which is 200, so that is 200 / 4 = 50. He also has half of the total planks, which is 200 / 2 = 100. And he has 20 planks from his friends, so he has 50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks. He needs 200 - 170 = 30 more planks from the store.
