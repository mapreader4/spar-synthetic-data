Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, there are 100 ducks in the original flock.

After 5 years, 20 ducks are killed and 30 are born, so the change in the flock size is:

-20 + 30 = 10

So, the new flock size is 100 + 10 = 110 ducks.

Then, they join another flock of 150 ducks. To find the total number of ducks, we add the two flocks together:

110 + 150 = 260 ducks.

Answer: 260
