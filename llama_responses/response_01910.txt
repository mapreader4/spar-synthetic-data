Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Johnson's one hectare cornfield can yield 80 corn every two months, so it can yield 40 corn every month.
2. The neighbor's two hectare cornfield can yield twice the amount as Johnson's, so it can yield 80 corn every month.
3. Since both cornfields are harvested every month, we can find the total amount of corn they can harvest in a year by multiplying the amount per hectare per month by the number of months in a year.
4. Johnson's hectare cornfield can harvest 40 corn per month, and the neighbor's hectare cornfield can harvest 80 corn per month. So, the total amount of corn they can harvest in a year would be:
40 * 12 = 480 for Johnson and 80 * 12 = 960 for the neighbor.
5. Adding the total amount of corn, we get 480 + 960 = 1440.

Answer: 1440
