Let's break it down step by step.

Mia has 4 times as many shells as David, so if David has 15 shells, Mia has 15 * 4 = 60 shells.

Ava has 20 more shells than Mia, so Ava has 60 + 20 = 80 shells.

Alice has half the number of shells Ava has, so Alice has 80 / 2 = 40 shells.

Now, let's add up the number of shells they all have:

Mia has 60 shells, Ava has 80 shells, and Alice has 40 shells. So, the total number of conch shells they all have is:

60 + 80 + 40 = 180.

Answer: 180
