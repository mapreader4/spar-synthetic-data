Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: There are 3 blackbirds in each of the 7 trees. To find the total number of blackbirds, we multiply the number of blackbirds in each tree by the number of trees.

3 x 7 = 21

Step 2: There are 13 magpies roaming around the park. These are not blackbirds, so we do not include them in our count.

Step 3: The total number of birds in the park is the sum of the number of blackbirds and the number of magpies.

21 + 0 = 21

Answer: 21
