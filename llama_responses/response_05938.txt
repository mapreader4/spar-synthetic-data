Let's break down the problem step by step.

The man wants to purchase a $120 pair of sneakers. He gets a 10% discount on the purchase price, so we need to find 10% of the original price.

10% of 120 is 10% * 120 = 12.

So, the man will get a discount of $12.

The man also has a coupon for $10 off any pair of sneakers, so he will get an additional $10 off the purchase price.

The man will pay the original price minus the discount, which is 120 - 12 = 108. Then, he will pay 108 - 10 = 98.

Answer: 98
