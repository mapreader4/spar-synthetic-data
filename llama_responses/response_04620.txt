Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the car. It takes 5 people to lift a car. 

Let's move on to the trucks. It takes twice as many people to lift a truck as it takes to lift a car. So, for a truck, it takes 5 * 2 = 10 people.

Now, let's add the number of people needed to lift the cars and trucks. It's 5 for the cars and 10 for the trucks. 5 + 10 = 15.

So, it takes 15 people to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks.
