Let's break this problem down step by step.

The first box had 10 movies at $2.00 each, so the total cost of those DVDs is:

10 x $2.00 = $20.00

The second box had 5 movies at $5.00 each, so the total cost of those DVDs is:

5 x $5.00 = $25.00

In total, Duke spent $20.00 + $25.00 = $45.00 on the 15 movies.
