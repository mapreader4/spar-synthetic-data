To find the amount of material required to make 12 quilts, we can use the unit rate of material needed to make 1 quilt. We know that 21 yards of material can make 7 quilts, so to find the rate of material needed for 1 quilt, we can divide 21 yards by 7. This gives us 3 yards of material for 1 quilt.

To find the amount of material needed for 12 quilts, we can multiply the rate of material for 1 quilt by 12. So, 3 yards of material for 1 quilt multiplied by 12 quilts is 36 yards of material.
