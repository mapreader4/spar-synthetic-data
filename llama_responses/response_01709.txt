Let's break this problem down step by step.

On Monday, 300 messages were sent.

On Tuesday, 200 messages were sent.

On Wednesday, 300 more messages were sent than the previous day, so 300 + 200 = 500 messages were sent on Wednesday.

On Thursday, two times as many messages were sent as on Wednesday, so 2 x 500 = 1000 messages were sent on Thursday.

To find the total number of messages sent in the Whatsapp group, we add the number of messages sent each day:

300 + 200 + 500 + 1000 = 1900

Answer: 1900
