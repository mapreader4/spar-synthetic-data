Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

Oliver has $40 and 200 quarters. This means he has a total of $40 + 200/4 = $50.

He gives his sister $5 and 120 quarters. This means he gives her $5 and 30 quarters.

So, we subtract the amount he gives away from the total amount he had.

$50 - $5 = $45

$50 - 30 = $20

So, Oliver is left with $20.
