Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total time it takes for a robot to make a battery. The total time it takes is 6 minutes to gather the materials and 9 minutes to create the battery, so the total time is 15 minutes.

Now, if we have 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, we need to find how many batteries they can make in 5 hours.

To find the number of batteries they can make in 5 hours, we need to divide the total time available (5 hours) by the time it takes to make a battery (15 minutes). This is because we want to know how many groups of batteries can be made in the given time.

To do this, we divide 5 hours by 15 minutes, which is the same as dividing 300 minutes by 15. This gives us:

300 รท 15 = 20

So, Answer: 20
