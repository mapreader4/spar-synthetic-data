To find the total cost of the family's admission tickets, I will first find the cost of the adult tickets. The adult tickets cost $22 each, and there are 2 of them, so the total cost of the adult tickets is 2 x $22, which is $44.

Next, I will find the cost of the children's tickets. The children's tickets cost $7 each, and there are 2 of them, so the total cost of the children's tickets is 2 x $7, which is $14.

The total cost of the family's tickets is the sum of the cost of the adult tickets and the cost of the children's tickets, so the total cost is 44 + 14, which is $58.
