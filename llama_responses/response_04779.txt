Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the profit she makes from selling 3 shirts: $21.

If she sells 7 shirts, she would make 7 * 21 = 147 dollars.

Now, let's find the profit she makes from selling 3 pairs of sandals. Since she makes 4 times as much profit for 2 pairs, we know that she makes 4 * 21 = 84 dollars for 2 pairs of sandals. So, for 3 pairs of sandals, she would make 3 * 84 = 252 dollars.

To find the total profit, we add the profit from shirts and sandals: 147 + 252 = 399.

Answer: 399
