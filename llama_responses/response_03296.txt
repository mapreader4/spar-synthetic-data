Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the variables.

Let's say the time it takes Kyle to travel to work and back is x hours. Then, the cost of buying a pack of snacks is 2x. We know that Kyle bikes for 2 hours to work every day, so we know that 2x is equal to the time it takes to travel to work and back. We also know that 2x is the cost of buying a pack of snacks. So, we can say that 2x is the cost of buying a pack of snacks.

To find the cost in dollars, we need to multiply 2x by 50. So, the cost will be 2x * 50 = 2 * 50 = 100.

Answer: 100.
