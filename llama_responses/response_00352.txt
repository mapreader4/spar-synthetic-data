Let's think step by step.

Let's first find the total number of cards Punger has. He buys 60 packs of baseball cards. Each pack has 7 cards. So, the total number of cards is 60 * 7 = 420 cards.

He wants to put these cards in special pages. Each page can hold 10 cards. So, we need to find how many times 420 cards can be divided by 10.

420 รท 10 = 42.

Answer: 42
