Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know.  Mark brings in 4 times as many cans as Jaydon.  So, let's call the number of cans that Jaydon brings in x.  Then, we know that Mark brings in 4x cans.  Let's write that as an equation:

4x = Mark's cans

We know that Jaydon brings in 5 more than twice the amount of cans that Rachel brought in.  Let's call the number of cans that Rachel brought in y.  Then, we know that Jaydon brings in 2y cans.  We can write that as an equation:

2y = Jaydon's cans

We know that there are 135 cans in total.  We can write that as an equation:

x + 4x + 2y = 135

We know that Mark brings in 4x cans and Jaydon brings in 2y cans.  So, we can write that as an equation:

x + 4x = 135 - 2y

We can solve for x.  To do this, we can subtract 2y from both sides of the equation and then divide both sides by 4:

x + 4x - 2y = 135 - 2y / 4

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = (135 - 2y) / 4

x = 33.75

So, the answer is 33 cans.
