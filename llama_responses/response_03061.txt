Let's break down the information given into smaller parts.

Mikaela earns $10 per hour. For the first month, she tutored for 35 hours. So, her total earnings in the first month are:

35 hours * 10 dollars per hour = 350 dollars

In the second month, she tutored 5 hours more than the first month, so she tutored for a total of:

35 + 5 = 40 hours

Her total earnings in the second month are:

40 hours * 10 dollars per hour = 400 dollars

Her total earnings for the two months are:

350 + 400 = 750 dollars

She spent 4/5 of her total earnings on her personal needs. So, to find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent on her personal needs from her total earnings:

750 - (4/5 * 750) = 750 - 600 = 150

Mikaela saved 150 dollars.
