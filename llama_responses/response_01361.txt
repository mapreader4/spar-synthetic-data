Let's start by using the information that Annie buys 8 hamburgers for $4 each. So, 8 x 4 = 32. Then, Annie buys 6 milkshakes for $5 each. So, 6 x 5 = 30. So, in total, Annie spends 32 + 30 = 62 dollars. To find out how much money Annie had at first, we subtract 62 from 70. 70 - 62 = 8. So, Annie had 8 dollars at first.
