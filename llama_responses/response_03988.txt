Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay:

* The hotel stay is for 2 nights at $4000 per night, so the total cost of the hotel stay is 2 x $4000 = $8000.

Next, let's calculate the value of the car:

* The car is worth $30000.

Next, let's calculate the value of the house:

* The house is worth four times the value of the car, which is 4 x $30000 = $120000.

Now, let's add up the total value of all the treats:

* The hotel stay is $8000, the car is $30000, and the house is $120000, so the total value of all the treats is $8000 + $30000 + $120000 = $220000.

Answer: 220000
