Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the cost of the 2 green notebooks is x.

The total cost of the notebooks is $45.

We know that the black notebook cost $15 and the pink notebook cost $10.

So, the total cost of the green notebooks is 45 - 15 - 10 = 20.

Since there are 2 green notebooks, the cost of each green notebook is 20 / 2 = 10.
