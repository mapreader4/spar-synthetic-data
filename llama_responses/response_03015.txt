Let's break it down step by step.

Sam has 19 dimes and 6 quarters. She buys 4 candy bars for 3 dimes each, which is 12 dimes. So she spends 12 dimes. She has 19 - 12 = 7 dimes left.

She also buys 1 lollipop for 1 quarter. 1 quarter is 25 cents. So she spends 25 cents. So now she has 7 dimes - 25 cents left.

She has 7 dimes is 35 cents and 6 quarters, which is 15 cents. So she has 35 cents + 15 cents = 50 cents. She has 50 cents left.

Answer: 50
