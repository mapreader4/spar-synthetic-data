Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by figuring out how many pots he can fit on each shelf.

Each shelf can hold 5 pots vertically, so let's multiply that by the number of shelves he has.

Since there are 60 pots in total, and he can stack 5 pots vertically on each shelf, he can fit 60 / 5 = 12 pots on each shelf.
