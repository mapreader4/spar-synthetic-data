Let's break this down step by step.

There are 400 students in total.

120 students take dance as their elective, which is 30% of the total number of students.

200 students take art as their elective, which is 50% of the total number of students.

The rest of the students, which is 400 - 200 - 120 = 80, take music as their elective.

To find the percentage of students who take music, we can use the formula:

Percentage = (Number of students taking music) / (Total number of students) * 100

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

Percentage = (80) / (400) * 100

Percentage = 20%

Answer: 20
