Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many tablespoons of lime juice Julio uses per day. Since he uses 1 tablespoon of lime juice and 2 tablespoons of lime juice are squeezed per lime, we can find the number of limes used per day by dividing 1 by 2.

1 ÷ 2 = 0.5 limes per day

Now, let's find out how many limes Julio will use in 30 days. We can multiply the number of limes used per day by the number of days.

0.5 limes per day × 30 days = 15 limes

Now, let's find the cost of limes. Since limes are 3 for $1.00, we can find the cost per lime by dividing 1 by 3.

$1.00 ÷ 3 = $0.33 per lime

Now, let's find the total cost of limes. We can multiply the number of limes by the cost per lime.

15 limes × $0.33 = $4.95

Answer: $4.95
