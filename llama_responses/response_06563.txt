Let's break this down step by step.

Jack has 8 plates with a checked pattern. He buys 2 times as many polka dotted plates as he has checked plates, which is 2 * 8 = 16. So, Jack now has 8 + 16 = 24 polka dotted plates.

He then smashes one of the flowered plates. This means he has 24 - 1 = 23 plates left.

Answer: 23
