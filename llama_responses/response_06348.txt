Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Jill initially has 9 llamas, and 9 of them got pregnant with 1 calf each, so she has a total of 9 + 9 = 18 calves.

2. Then, 5 of the llamas got pregnant with twins, which means that 5 of them had 2 calves each, for a total of 5 x 2 = 10 calves.

3. Jill now has a total of 18 calves and the 9 original llamas, for a total of 18 + 9 = 27 llamas.

4. She trades 8 of the calves for 2 new adult llamas, so she loses 8 calves, but gains 2 llamas. The total number of llamas remains the same, but the number of calves decreases by 8.

5. Jill sells 1/3 of her herd at the market, which is 1/3 of 27 = 9 llamas. She loses 9 llamas, so she now has 27 - 9 = 18 llamas left.

6. So, Jill has a total of 18 llamas, which are 18 calves and 0 adult llamas.

Answer: 18
