Let's break it down step by step.

Mary chops up 18 chairs, which makes 18 x 6 = 108 sticks of wood.

Mary also chops up 6 tables, which makes 6 x 9 = 54 sticks of wood.

Mary also chops up 4 stools, which makes 4 x 2 = 8 sticks of wood.

In total, Mary has 108 + 54 + 8 = 170 sticks of wood.

Mary needs 5 sticks of wood per hour to stay warm, so to find out how many hours she can keep warm, we can divide the total sticks by 5.

170 รท 5 = 34

Answer: 34
