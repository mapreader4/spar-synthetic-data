Let's break this problem down step by step.

Janet makes $70 an hour for her exterminator work, and she does 20 hours of that work. So, she makes:

70 x 20 = 1400 dollars from her exterminator work.

She also sells two sculptures. The 5-pound sculpture is worth $20 per pound, so that's:

5 x 20 = 100 dollars

The 7-pound sculpture is also worth $20 per pound, so that's:

7 x 20 = 140 dollars

In total, Janet makes:

1400 (from exterminator work) + 100 (from 5-pound sculpture) + 140 (from 7-pound sculpture) = 1640 dollars

Answer: 1640
