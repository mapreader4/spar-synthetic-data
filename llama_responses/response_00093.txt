Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the beef.
John orders 1000 pounds of beef at $8 per pound. So the cost of the beef is:
1000 * 8 = 8000

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the chicken.
John orders twice as much chicken as the beef, so the cost of the chicken is:
1000 * 3 = 3000

Step 3: Add the cost of the beef and chicken together.
The total cost is the sum of the cost of the beef and chicken:
8000 + 3000 = 11000

Answer: 11000
