To solve this problem, I will think step by step.

Let's break it down:

1. The rent is $1200 per year, which means it is $100 per month. To find the 30% of the money Mrs. McPherson needs to raise, I will multiply 30 by 100 (100% of the rent) and then divide the result by 12 (the number of months in a year).

100 * 30 = 3000

3000 / 12 = 250

So, Mrs. McPherson needs to raise $250.

Answer: 250
