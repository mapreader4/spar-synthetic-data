Let's break it down step by step.

John starts with 3 boxes of burritos, which is 3 x 20 = 60 burritos.

He gives away a 1/3 of the burritos, which is 60 / 3 = 20 burritos. So, he has 60 - 20 = 40 burritos left.

He eats 3 burritos per day for 10 days. So, he eats 3 x 10 = 30 burritos.

He has 40 - 30 = 10 burritos left.

Answer: 10
