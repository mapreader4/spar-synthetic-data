Let's break it down step by step.

1. Jackson buys a computer game for $66.
2. He also buys three movie tickets for $12 each, so that is a total of $36.
3. To find the total cost of entertainment, we need to add the cost of the computer game to the cost of the movie tickets.
4. So, the total cost of entertainment is $66 (for the computer game) + $36 (for the movie tickets) = $102.
