Let's break this down step by step.

1. Initially, Steve puts $100 into the bank. So the initial amount in the bank is $100.

2. Each year, Steve earns 10% interest on the money in the account. So, the interest for the first year is 0.10 * 100 = 10.

3. The interest is added to the principal, so the amount in the bank after the first year is 100 + 10 = 110.

4. In the second year, Steve earns 10% interest on the money in the account. The interest earned in the first year is 10, and the principal is 110. So, the interest in the second year is 0.10 * 110 = 11.

5. The interest is added to the principal, so the amount in the bank after the second year is 110 + 11 = 121.

So, the amount in the bank after 2 years is $121.
