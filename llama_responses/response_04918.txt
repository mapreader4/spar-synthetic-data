Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Chandra scored twice as many points as Akiko.
* Akiko scored 4 more points than Michiko.
* Michiko scored half as many points as Bailey.
* Bailey scored 14 points.

From the information, we can set up the following equations:

1. Let x be the number of points scored by Akiko. Then, Chandra scored 2x points.
2. Michiko scored x - 4 points.
3. Michiko scored 1/2 * 14 = 7 points (since Bailey scored 14 points and Michiko scored half as many).

We can substitute the value of Michiko's points into the first equation to get:

2x = x - 4 + 7

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = x + 3

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

x = 3

So, Akiko scored 3 points. Since Chandra scored twice as many points as Akiko, Chandra scored 2 * 3 = 6 points.

Michiko scored 7 points, and Bailey scored 14 points. Therefore, the total number of points scored by the team is:

3 + 6 + 7 + 14 = 20

Answer: 20
