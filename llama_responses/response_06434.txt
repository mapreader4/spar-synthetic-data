To find the change Clive will have after buying the olives, we need to subtract the cost of the olives from the $10 he has.

Let's first find the cost of the olives. If a jar of 20 olives costs $1.50, then the cost of 80 olives would be 80 x 1.50 = $12.00.

Now, we subtract the cost of the olives from the $10 Clive has:

$10 - $12.00 = $-2.00
