Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Brayden and Gavin scored 7 touchdowns, so they scored 7 x 7 = 49 points.
* Cole and Freddy's team scored 9 touchdowns, so they scored 9 x 7 = 63 points.

To find the difference in points between the two teams, we need to subtract the points scored by Brayden and Gavin from the points scored by Cole and Freddy:

63 (Cole and Freddy's points) - 49 (Brayden and Gavin's points) = 14

So, Cole and Freddy had 14 more points than Brayden and Gavin.
