Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding Bill's height. Since Bill is half of Cary's height, and Cary is 72 inches tall, then Bill is 72 / 2 = 36 inches tall.

Now, Jan is 6 inches taller than Bill. So, Bill is 36 inches, and Jan is 36 + 6 = 42 inches tall.

So, the answer is: Answer: 42
