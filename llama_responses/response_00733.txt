Let's break this down step by step.

Henry collected 11 seashells.
John collected 24 seashells.
They initially collected a total of 11 + 24 = 35 seashells.

Leo gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid. A quarter of 24 is 6, so Leo gave 6 seashells away.

Now, they have 35 - 6 = 29 seashells left.

So, the total number of seashells they have now is 11 + 24 - 6 = 29.

Answer: 29
