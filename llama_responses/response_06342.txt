Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of customers that enter the store every hour. The number of customers per hour is 175.

During the holiday season, the number of customers doubles. So, the new number of customers per hour is 175 * 2 = 350.

The store is open for 8 hours. To find the total number of customers the store sees in 8 hours, we multiply the number of customers per hour by the number of hours.

350 * 8 = 2800.

Answer: 2800
