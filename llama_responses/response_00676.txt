Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the pills for the month.  The total number of pills for the month is 60 (30 days x 2 pills per day).  The cost of the pills is 60 x 1.5 = 90.  Now, the insurance covers 40% of the cost.  So, the cost covered by the insurance is 0.4 x 90 = 36.  So, John pays 90 - 36 = 54.
