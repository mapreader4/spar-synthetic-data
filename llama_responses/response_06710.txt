Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by calculating the cost of the charms. Tim uses 10 charms to make each necklace, and each charm costs $15, so the cost of the charms is 10 x 15 = 150.

Now, let's calculate the revenue. Tim sells the necklace for $200, so the revenue is 200.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the charms from the revenue. Profit = revenue - cost = 200 - 150 = 50.

Answer: 50
