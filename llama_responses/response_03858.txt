Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be Bethany's current age. Since her younger sister is half her age, we know that the sister's age is x/2. We know that in 5 years, her sister will be 16, so we can set up an equation.

x + 5 = 16

Now we can solve for x. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 11

So Bethany is 11 years old.
