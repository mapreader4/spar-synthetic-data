Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of cherry saplings that sprout.

Kim plants 80 cherry pits, and 25% of them sprout. To find the number of saplings that sprout, we multiply 25% by 80.

25% of 80 is the same as 0.25 x 80, which is 20.

So, 20 cherry saplings sprout.

Kim sells 6 of the saplings. So, we subtract 6 from the 20 saplings that sprout.

20 - 6 = 14.

So, Kim has 14 cherry saplings left.
