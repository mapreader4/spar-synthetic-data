Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of sweets initially in the packet. The packet has 30 cherry-flavored sweets, 40 strawberry-flavored sweets, and 50 pineapple-flavored sweets. So, the total number of sweets is:

30 + 40 + 50 = 120

Now, Aaron eats half of each of the flavored sweets. So, he eats:

* Half of 30 cherry-flavored sweets is 30 / 2 = 15
* Half of 40 strawberry-flavored sweets is 40 / 2 = 20
* Half of 50 pineapple-flavored sweets is 50 / 2 = 25

So, Aaron eats 15 + 20 + 25 = 60 sweets.

Now, he gives 5 cherry-flavored sweets to his friend. So, the number of sweets left in the packet is:

120 - 60 - 5 = 55

Answer: 55
