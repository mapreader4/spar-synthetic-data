Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total size of the files in megabits. We have 80 megabits, 90 megabits, and 70 megabits. To find the total, we add these numbers together:

80 + 90 + 70 = 240 megabits

Now, Cortney's internet speed is 2 megabits per minute. To find the number of minutes it will take to download the files, we can divide the total size of the files by her internet speed:

240 megabits (total size) / 2 megabits (internet speed) = 120 minutes

Since we want to find the number of hours, we can divide the number of minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Answer: 2
