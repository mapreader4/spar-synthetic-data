Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Mario's salary increased by 40% to $4000 this year. This means that Mario's current salary is $4000 more than his salary last year.

We are told that Bob's salary from last year was equal to three times Mario's salary this year. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Mario's salary last year = 3 * Mario's salary this year

We are also given that Bob's current salary is 20% more than his salary last year. So, we can set up another equation to represent this information:

Bob's current salary = Bob's salary last year + 20%

We can simplify the first equation to get Mario's salary last year:

Mario's salary last year = Mario's salary this year / 1.4

Now we can substitute this expression into the second equation:

Bob's current salary = (Mario's salary this year / 1.4) + 20%

We can now solve for Bob's current salary:

Bob's current salary = (Mario's salary this year / 1.4) + (Mario's salary this year / 1.4) * 0.2

To solve this, we need to know Mario's salary this year. We are given that Mario's salary increased by 40% to $4000 this year. So, we can write:

Mario's salary this year = Mario's salary last year + 4000

Substituting this into our equation:

Bob's current salary = (Mario's salary last year + 4000) / 1.4 + (Mario's salary last year + 4000) * 0.2

To simplify, we can combine the like terms:

Bob's current salary = (Mario's salary last year + 4000) * 1.2

We can now solve for Bob's current salary:

Bob's current salary = 1.2 * (Mario's salary last year + 4000)

Bob's current salary = 1.2 * 6000

Bob's current salary = 7200

Answer: 7200
