Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of participants in 2018 is 150.
2. The number of participants in 2019 is 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, which is 2(150) + 20 = 320.
3. The number of participants in 2020 is 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, which is (320)/2 - 40 = 120.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of participants in 2019 and 2020:

2019: 320
2020: 120

To find the difference, subtract 120 from 320:

320 - 120 = 200

Answer: 200
