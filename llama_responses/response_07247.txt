Let's break down the information given into steps:

1. The attendance for the first day was 2700 people.
2. The attendance for the second day was half the attendance of the first day, which is 2700 / 2 = 1350.
3. The attendance for the third day was three times the attendance of the first day, which is 2700 x 3 = 8100.

The attendance for the second day is 1350.
