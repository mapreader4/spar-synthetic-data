Let's break this down step by step.

On Monday, Sidney does 20 jumping jacks. On Tuesday, Sidney does 36 jumping jacks. On Thursday, Sidney does 50 jumping jacks.

Brooke does three times as many jumping jacks as Sidney. So, Brooke does 3 x (20 + 36 + 50) jumping jacks. 3 x (20 + 36 + 50) = 3 x 106 = 318. So, Brooke does 318 jumping jacks.

Answer: 318
