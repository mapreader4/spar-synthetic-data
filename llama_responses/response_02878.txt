Let's break this down step by step.

Noah's bedroom light uses 6 watts per hour. Since it's on for 2 hours, it uses 6 x 2 = 12 watts in total.

His office light uses 3 times as much energy as the bedroom light, so it uses 12 x 3 = 36 watts.

The living room light uses 4 times as much energy as the bedroom light, so it uses 36 x 4 = 144 watts.

To find the total energy used, we add the energy used by each light:

12 + 36 + 144 = 192

So, Noah has used 192 watts.
