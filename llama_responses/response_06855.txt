Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the time it takes to bleach her hair is x hours. Since dyeing takes twice as long as bleaching, the time it takes to dye her hair is also x hours. The total time it takes to bleach and dye her hair is 9 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + x = 9

We know that dyeing takes twice as long as bleaching, so we can rewrite the equation as:

2x = 9

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 9 / 2
x = 4.5

So, it will take Cordelia 4.5 hours to bleach her hair.
