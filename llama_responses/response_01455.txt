Let's start by finding the number of tomato plants in the first garden. There are 10% of 20 plants that are tomato plants, so we can multiply 10% by 20 to get the number of tomato plants in the first garden: 10% * 20 = 2. In the second garden, 1/3 of 15 plants are tomato plants. We can multiply 1/3 by 15 to get the number of tomato plants in the second garden: 1/3 * 15 = 5.

To find the total number of tomato plants, we add the number of tomato plants in the two gardens: 2 + 5 = 7. Now, to find the percentage of tomato plants in all the plants in her two gardens, we divide the number of tomato plants by the total number of plants in both gardens. There are 20 + 15 = 35 total plants in both gardens. So, the percentage of tomato plants is 7 / 35 = 20%.
