Let's break this down step by step!

Antonia has 5 supplements, and 3 of them have 120 pills each. So, she has a total of 3 x 120 = 360 pills from those 3 bottles.

The other 2 bottles have 30 pills each, so she has a total of 2 x 30 = 60 pills from those 2 bottles.

In total, she has 360 + 60 = 420 pills.

She uses 1 pill from each of the 5 supplements for 2 weeks, which means she uses 5 x 14 = 70 pills.

So, she has 420 - 70 = 350 pills left.

Answer: 350
