Let's break it down step by step.

1. The baker has 10 cheesecakes on the display.
2. 15 more cheesecakes are in the fridge, so the total number of cheesecakes is 10 + 15 = 25.
3. The baker sells 7 cheesecakes from the display. So, the number of cheesecakes on the display is 10 - 7 = 3.
4. So, the number of cheesecakes left to be sold is the total number of cheesecakes minus the number sold, which is 25 - 7 = 18.

Answer: 18
