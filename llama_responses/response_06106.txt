Let's first find the total weight of the men and the total weight of the women. The total weight of the men is 8 x 190 = 1520. The total weight of the women is 6 x 120 = 720. The total weight of the men and women together is 1520 + 720 = 2240. The average weight of the men and women is 2240 / 14 = 160. Answer: 160.
