Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Bill makes x trips. Then Jean makes x + 6 trips. Since they make a total of 40 trips, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 6) = 40

To solve for x, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation:

x + x + 6 - x = 40 - x

This simplifies to:

2x = 34

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 34 รท 2

x = 17

So Bill makes 17 trips. Since Jean makes 6 more trips than Bill, Jean makes 17 + 6 = 23 trips.

Answer: 23
