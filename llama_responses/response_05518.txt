Let's start by identifying the number of Aaron's brothers. Let's say that the number of Aaron's brothers is x.

Since Bennett has 6 brothers, and the number of Bennett's brothers is two less than twice the number of Aaron's brothers, we can set up the following equation:

x = 6 - 2 * x

To solve this equation, we can subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 6 - 2 * x
x = 6 - 2x
x = 6 - 2x + x

Now, we can add x to both sides of the equation to get:

x + x = 6

Subtracting x from both sides again, we get:

0 = 6

This means that x = 0. Since x is the number of Aaron's brothers, this means Aaron has 0 brothers.

Answer: 0
