Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of pages Cora has read so far.

On Monday, she read 23 pages.
On Tuesday, she read 38 pages.
On Wednesday, she read 61 pages.
The total number of pages she has read is 23 + 38 + 61 = 122.

The book has 158 pages. Since she has already read 122 pages, she has 158 - 122 = 36 pages left to read.

Since she will read twice as much on Friday as she does on Thursday, and Thursday is 2 days before Friday, she will read 2 * 61 = 122 pages on Thursday.

But she only has 36 pages left to read. So, she must read 36 pages on Thursday to finish the book in time.

Answer: 36
