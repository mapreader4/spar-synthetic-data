Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of tomatoes Tedra harvested on Wednesday and Thursday: 400 kg on Wednesday and half as much on Thursday, which is 200 kg. Then, the total number of tomatoes he harvested on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 400 + 200 = 600 kg. If he gives away 700 kg of them, he will have 600 - 700 = 100 kg left.
