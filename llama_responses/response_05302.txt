Let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Pauly is making omelets for his family, and there are 3 people in his family, including himself.

We also know that each omelet requires 4 eggs, and there are 3 dozen eggs in total.

To find out how many omelets each person gets, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of people.

So, we divide 3 dozen eggs (which is equal to 36) by 4 (since each omelet requires 4 eggs), which is equal to 9.

So, each person gets 9 omelets.
