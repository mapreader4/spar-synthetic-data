Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Nancy needs to pay for tuition. The tuition costs $22,000 per semester, and her parents can pay half the cost. So, her parents can pay $11,000.

Next, Nancy can get a scholarship for $3,000 and a student loan for twice her scholarship amount, which is $6,000. So, in total, she can get $9,000 from scholarships and loans.

Now, let's subtract the amount Nancy can get from scholarships and loans from the tuition cost:

$22,000 (tuition) - $11,000 (parents' contribution) - $9,000 (scholarships and loans) = $2,000

So, Nancy needs to pay $2,000 out of her own pocket.

Now, Nancy can work a total of 200 hours during the semester, and she needs to make enough money to pay the $2,000 she needs to pay. To find out how much she needs to make per hour, we can divide the amount she needs to pay by the number of hours she can work:

$2,000 (amount she needs to pay) รท 200 (hours she can work) = $10

So, Nancy needs to make at least $10 per hour to pay the rest of the tuition.
