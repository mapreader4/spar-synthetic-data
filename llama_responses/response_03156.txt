Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Kendra made 3 batches of cookies. Each batch has 12 cookies. So, in total, Kendra made 3 x 12 = 36 cookies.

Next, we know that each cookie has 2 chocolate chips. So, the total number of chocolate chips is 36 x 2 = 72.

Since there are 4 people in Kendra's family, and they all get the same number of cookies, we can divide the total number of chocolate chips by 4 to find out how many each person gets.

72 / 4 = 18

Answer: 18
