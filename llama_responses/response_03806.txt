Let's break it down step by step.

Let's let the cost of one jellyfish be x. Since the cost of one eel is nine times that amount, the cost of one eel is 9x.

The total cost of one order of jellyfish and one order of eel is $200. So, the equation is:

x + 9x = 200

We can solve for x, the cost of one jellyfish, by subtracting 9x from both sides of the equation:

x + 9x = 200 - 9x = 200 - 9x

This simplifies to:

x = 200/10

x = 20

So, the cost of one jellyfish is $20.

Since the cost of one eel is nine times that amount, the cost of one eel is 9 * 20 = 180.

Answer: 180
