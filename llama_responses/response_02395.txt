Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the number of adults. The problem states that the chef has served 58 adults. Let's call this number A.

The problem also states that there are 35 fewer children than the number of adults, so the number of children is A - 35.

The problem also states that there are twice as many seniors as children, so the number of seniors is (A - 35) * 2.

We can now write an equation to represent the number of seniors: A - 35 * 2 = 70.

The total number of guests served is the sum of the number of adults, children, and seniors: A + (A - 35) + 70.

Substituting the values we found for A, we get:

58 + (58 - 35) + 70 = 58 + 23 + 70 = 151

Answer: 151
