Let's break this problem down step by step.

Mary had 6 lambs initially.

She traded 3 lambs for one goat, so she now has 6 - 3 = 3 lambs less.

Then, she had 2 lambs that had 2 babies each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 lambs. 4 lambs were added to her total lambs, making the total 3 + 4 = 7 lambs.

Finally, she found an extra 7 lambs in the field, so she now has 7 + 3 = 10 lambs.

Answer: 10
