To solve this problem, I will start by setting up an equation based on the given information.

Let x be the distance in miles that the car covered. The ratio of fuel used to distance is 4:7, so we can write an equation as follows:

(4/7) = 44/x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to get:

x = (44)(7)

x = 308

Answer: 308
