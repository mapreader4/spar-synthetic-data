Let's start by calculating the total cost of the items she is purchasing:

2 containers of hummus for $5 each is 2 x 5 = 10
Chicken for $20
Bacon for $10
Vegetables for $10

The total cost is 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 40

Joan has a total of $60 to spend, so she will have $20 left over.

She wants to purchase apples which are $2 each. She can purchase 20 apples with the $20.
