Let's break this down step by step.

1. The cost of the magazine is $0.85.
2. The cost of the pencil is $0.50.
3. The coupon gives him $0.35 off, which means the total cost is the cost of the magazine and pencil minus the discount.
4. So, the cost of the magazine and pencil together is $0.85 + $0.50 = $1.35.
5. The discount is $0.35, so the final cost is $1.35 - $0.35 = $1.00.

Answer: 1.00
