Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20.
* The three friends, Sally, Jenny, and Moses, paid $128 for their harvest.
* The entrance fee to access the strawberry fields is $4 per person.
* The three friends are picking strawberries as many as they wish, and then take them to Miguel for weighing and pricing.

Let's use the information given to create an equation to solve the problem.

Let's assume that the total number of pounds of strawberries is x.

The cost of the harvest is $128, which is the total amount the friends paid.

The entrance fee is $4 per person, so the total entrance fee for the three friends is 3 * 4 = $12.

The total cost of the strawberries is the cost of the harvest minus the entrance fee, which is 128 - 12 = 116.

Now, we need to find the number of pounds of strawberries. We know that the cost of a pound of strawberries is $20, so we can divide the total cost by the cost of a pound to find the total number of pounds.

116 / 20 = 5.8

Answer: 5.8
