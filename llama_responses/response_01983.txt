Let's break down the cost of the groceries into categories. The cost of the meat is:

* 3 pounds of broccoli for $4 a pound = $12
* 3 oranges for $0.75 each = $2.25
* 1 pound of bacon for $3 = $3
* 2 pounds of chicken for $3 a pound = $6

The total cost of the meat is $12 + $2.25 + $3 + $6 = $17.25. The total grocery budget is not specified, so we will assume it is $100. The percentage of the budget spent on meat is:

($17.25 / $100) * 100 = 17.25 / 100 * 100 = 17.25%

Answer: 17
