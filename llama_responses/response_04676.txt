Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. Tim gets the maximum $1200 from 500 people. This is the initial donation.
2. Three times as many people donated half this sum of money to his campaign. So, three times 500 is 1500, and half of 1200 is 600. So, 1500 + 600 is 2100 people donated to the campaign.
3. These donations together accounted for 40% of the total money that Tim raised. So, the total money Tim raised is 100% - 40% = 60% of the total money. 2100 is 40% of the total money, so the total money is 2100 / 0.4 = 5250. 5250 * 0.6 = 3150.

Answer: 3150
