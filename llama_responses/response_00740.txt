Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's start by identifying the information we know: Barry bought 12 pretzels.
2. We know that Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly did. So, if Barry bought 12 pretzels, then Shelly must have bought 12 / 3 = 4 pretzels.
3. We know that Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Angie did. So, if Shelly bought 4 pretzels, then Angie must have bought 4 x 3 = 12 pretzels.

Answer: 12
