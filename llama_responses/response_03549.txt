Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's start by letting x be Jerica's age. Since Matilda is 7 years older than Jerica, we can write an equation to represent the information given.

x + 7 = 2x

Since Louis is 14, we know that x must be 7. So, we can substitute 7 for x in the equation.

7 + 7 = 2(7)

We can simplify the right side of the equation by multiplying 2 and 7.

14 = 14

So, Matilda is 14 + 7 = 21 years old.
