Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of fresh water: $1 per gallon.

Next, we know that each person needs 1/2 a gallon of fresh water a day. So, we need to calculate the total amount of fresh water needed for the family of 6 people.

1/2 a gallon per person per day, so for 6 people, we need:

1/2 * 6 = 3 gallons of fresh water per day

Since we want to know the cost of fresh water for the day, we need to multiply the total amount of fresh water needed by the cost per gallon.

Cost per gallon * 3 gallons = Cost for the day

Cost for the day = $1 * 3 = $3
