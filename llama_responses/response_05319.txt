Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the price of an adult ticket is x. Since the price of an adult ticket is twice that of a child's ticket, the price of a child's ticket is x/2.

The total amount collected is 400 adults + 200 children. Since the price of an adult ticket is x, the total amount collected from adults is 400 * x. The price of a child's ticket is x/2, so the total amount collected from children is 200 * (x/2).

The total amount collected is 400 adults + 200 children. So, we can set up the equation as:

400x + 200 * (x/2) = 16000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

400x + 100x = 16000

Subtract 400 from both sides of the equation:

x = 16000 - 400 = 16000 - 400

x = 16000 - 400 = 16000 - 400

x = 40

Answer: 40
