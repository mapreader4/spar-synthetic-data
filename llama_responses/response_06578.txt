Let's start by finding the total number of books that were sold.

The total number of books that were sold is equal to the total number of books minus the number of books left, which is 9,900 - x.

Let's say the number of books sold is x. Then, the equation is 9,900 - x = 9,900 - 4/6 * 1,500.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to get 6 * (9,900 - x) = 6 * 1,500. Then, we can divide both sides by 6 to get 1,500 = 9,900 - x / 6.

This simplifies to 1,500 = 1,500 / 6. 1,500 / 6 = 250. So, the answer is 250.

Answer: 250
