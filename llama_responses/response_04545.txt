Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with Jackson's age. We know Jackson is 20 years old now.

Mandy is 10 years older than Jackson, so Mandy is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

Adele is 3/4 as old as Jackson, which means Adele is 20 * 3/4 = 15 years old.

To find the total of their ages 10 years from now, we need to add the current ages and subtract 10.

20 (Jackson) + 30 (Mandy) + 15 (Adele) = 65

So, the total of their ages 10 years from now is 65.
