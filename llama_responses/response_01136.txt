Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the total amount of food each dog eats in a day.

Emily's 4 dogs eat 250 grams of food per day. So, the total amount of food each dog eats in a day is 250 grams.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of food for the 14-day trip.

To find the total amount of food for the 14-day trip, we multiply the amount of food each dog eats in a day by the number of days.

250 grams per day * 14 days = 3500 grams

Answer: 3500
