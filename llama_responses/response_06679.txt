Let's break this down step by step.

Oliver starts with $9.

Oliver saves $5 from his allowance, leaving him with $9 - $5 = $4.

He then spends $4 on a frisbee, leaving him with $4 - $4 = $0.

Then, he spends $3 on a puzzle, leaving him with $0.

But then his friend gives him $8 as a birthday gift. So, Oliver now has $0 + $8 = $8.

Answer: 8
