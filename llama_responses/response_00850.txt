Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips, and Susana has 25 chocolate chips.

We know that Viviana has 3/4 as many Vanilla chips as Susana. So, if Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips, then Susana must have 20/3 = 6.66666667 Vanilla chips.

Now, we can find the total number of chips they have together. Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips, and Susana has 25 chocolate chips. So, the total is 20 + 25 = 45 chips.

Answer: 45
