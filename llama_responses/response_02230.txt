Let's break this problem down step by step.

Alfonso earns $6 each day, so in 1 week, he earns $6 x 7 = $42.

He already has $40, so he needs to earn $340 - $40 = $300 more.

To earn $300, he needs to work for 300 / 6 days per week, so in total, he needs to work 300 / 6 = 50 weeks.

Answer: 50
