Let's break it down step by step:

1. Katrina starts with 120 cookies initially.
2. In the morning, she sells 3 dozen cookies, which is 3 * 12 = 36 cookies.
3. So, she has 120 - 36 = 84 cookies left.
4. During the lunch rush, she sells 57 cookies.
5. So, she has 84 - 57 = 27 cookies left.
6. In the afternoon, she sells 16 more cookies.
7. So, she has 27 - 16 = 11 cookies left.
