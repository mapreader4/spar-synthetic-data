Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total area of the lawns she has already mowed. 20 x 15 is 300 square feet. She has mowed 3 of these lawns, so she has mowed 300 x 3 = 900 square feet. She has earned 900 x $.10 = 90 dollars. She needs to earn 150 - 90 = 60 more dollars to earn enough for the book set. 

Since she earns $.10 per square foot, she needs to mow 60 /.10 = 600 more square feet to earn the remaining amount. 

Answer: 600
