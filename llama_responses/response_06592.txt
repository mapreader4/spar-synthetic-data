Let's start by letting x be the area of Martha's bedroom. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so the total area is x + 60. We know that the total area is 300, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 300. We can subtract 60 from both sides to get the equation x + x = 240. We can then subtract 240 from both sides to get x = 120. So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.
