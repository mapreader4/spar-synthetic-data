Let's break this down step by step.

Jean has 60 stuffies initially.

She keeps 1/3 of them, so she keeps 20 stuffies (1/3 of 60 is 20).

She gives away the rest, which is 40 stuffies.

She gives 1/4 of what she gave away to her sister Janet, so she gives Janet 1/4 of 40, which is 10 stuffies.

So, Janet gets 10 stuffies.
