Let's break this down step by step.

1. The ratio of the profit is 2:5, which means that for every 7 units of the profit, Mike gets 2 units and Johnson gets 5 units.

2. The total profit is $2500, which is the total amount of money that is being shared between the two partners.

3. Since Mike gets 2 parts out of every 7 parts, we can find his share by multiplying the total profit by 2/7.

4. To find Mike's share, we multiply the total profit by 2/7, which gives us $2500 * 2/7 = $714.

5. Mike spends $200 on a shirt, so we subtract this amount from his share.

6. To find out how much Mike has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his share, which is $714 - $200 = $514.

Answer: 514
