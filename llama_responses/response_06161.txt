Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's let x be the amount Emilee earns. 

We know that Terrence earns $30. We also know that Jermaine earns $5 more than Terrence. 

So, we can write an equation to represent the situation:

Jermaine's earnings = Terrence's earnings + 5

We know that Terrence's earnings is $30, so we can substitute this into the equation:

Jermaine's earnings = 30 + 5

Jermaine's earnings = 35

So, Emilee's earnings are 35 - 30 = 5.

Answer: 5
