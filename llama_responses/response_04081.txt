Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of black shirts Mandy bought. Since each pack of black shirts has 5 shirts, and Mandy bought 3 packs of black shirts, we can multiply 3 x 5 = 15 black shirts.

Next, let's find the number of yellow shirts Mandy bought. Since each pack of yellow shirts has 2 shirts, and Mandy bought 3 packs of yellow shirts, we can multiply 3 x 2 = 6 yellow shirts.

To find the total number of shirts Mandy bought, we add the number of black shirts to the number of yellow shirts: 15 + 6 = 21.

Answer: 21
