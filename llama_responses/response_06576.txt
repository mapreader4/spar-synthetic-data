Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of lids Aaron has.

Aaron has 14 cans lids initially. He adds the lids he gets from the 3 boxes, which is 3 x 14 = 42 lids. So, he now has a total of 14 + 42 = 56 lids.

Aaron takes 53 lids to the recycling center. So, the number of lids he gets from each box is:

56 - 53 = 3.
