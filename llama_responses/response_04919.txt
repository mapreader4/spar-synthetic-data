Let's break this down step by step.

First, Ben needs 14 eggs per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Ben will need 14 * 4 = 56 eggs in a month.

Ked needs half of the number of eggs needed by Ben, which is 14. Half of 14 is 7. So, Ked will need 7 eggs per week. In a month, Ked will need 7 * 4 = 28 eggs.

Saly needs 10 eggs. So, the total number of eggs needed is 56 (for Ben) + 28 (for Ked) + 10 (for Saly) = 94 eggs.

Answer: 94
