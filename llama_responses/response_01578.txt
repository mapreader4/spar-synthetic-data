Let's start by calculating the cost of the chairs. Since three plastic chairs cost as much as a portable table, we know that the cost of one chair is 55/3 = 18.5 dollars. If Manny wants to buy one portable table and two chairs, the total cost is 1 x 18.5 + 2 x 18.5 = 45. 

Since the total cost is 45, and Manny has $100, we can subtract 45 from 100 to get the amount left: 100 - 45 = 55. 

Answer: 55
