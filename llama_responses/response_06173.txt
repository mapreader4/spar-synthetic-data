Let's start by identifying the number of candles each of them will get.

Ambika has 4 birthday candles, so Aniyah has 6 times as many candles, which is 4 x 6 = 24 candles.

If they put the birthday candles together and shared them equally between themselves, they will share the 24 candles equally.

To find out how many candles each one will get, we can divide 24 by 2.

24 รท 2 = 12

So, the answer is: Answer: 12
