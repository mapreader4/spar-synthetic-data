Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The first dose has a wait time of 20 minutes.
2. The second dose has a wait time that is half as long as the first dose. This means that the second dose has a wait time of 20/2 = 10 minutes.
3. To find the total wait time, we add the two wait times: 20 + 10 = 30.

Answer: 30
