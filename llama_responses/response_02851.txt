Let's start by identifying the age of Henry's sister. Since Henry is four times as old as his sister, and Aaron is 15 years old, we can let's say his sister is 15 / 4 = 3.75 years old. However, since she is three times as old as Aaron, she must be 15 * 3 = 45 years old.

Now, let's add the ages of the siblings: Aaron is 15 years old, and his sister is 45 years old. The combined age of the siblings is 15 + 45 = 60.
