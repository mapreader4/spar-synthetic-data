Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of questions she has answered so far. We know she has answered 16 questions, which is 20% of the total 80 questions.

Let's find the number of minutes she has used so far. We know she has used 12 minutes, which is 15% of the total 80 minutes.

To find the number of minutes she has left, we can multiply the number of minutes used by the total number of minutes. So, if she has used 15% of the total 80 minutes, we can multiply 15 by 4 to get 60 minutes.

So, the number of minutes she has left will be 80 - 60 = 20.

Answer: 20
