Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Carla is 2 years older than Karen. Since Karen is currently 2 years old, Carla must be 2 + 2 = 4 years old.

Next, we know that Ty is 4 years more than 2 times as old as Carla. So, Carla is 4 years old, so Ty is 4 + 4 = 8 years old.

Finally, we know that in 5 years, Frank will be three times as old as Ty is now. So, in 5 years, Frank will be 3 x 8 = 24 years old.

Answer: 24
