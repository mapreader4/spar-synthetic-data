To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the cost of each type of fabric. The checkered fabric costs $7.50 per yard, and the plain fabric costs $7.50 per yard. We know that Vivi spent $75 on checkered fabric and $45 on plain fabric, so the total amount of fabric bought is $75 + $45 = $120. We can now find the total number of yards of fabric by dividing the total cost by the cost per yard. $120 / $7.50 = 16.
