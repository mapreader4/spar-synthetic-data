Let's start by identifying the number of stickers each person has.

Ryan has 30 stickers.
Steven has thrice as many stickers as Ryan, which is 30. So Steven has 30 x 3 = 90 stickers.
Terry has 20 more stickers than Steven, which means Terry has 90 + 20 = 110 stickers.

To find the total number of stickers, we add the number of stickers each person has:

30 + 90 + 110 = 230.

Answer: 230
