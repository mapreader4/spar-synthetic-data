Let's break this down step by step.

1. We know that half of the blue mushrooms are 14 / 2 = 7. We are told that two-thirds of the red mushrooms are red, which is 12 / 3 = 4. And we know that all of the brown mushrooms are brown, so there are 6 of them.

2. We know that half of the blue mushrooms, 7, are white-spotted. So, we can conclude that the total number of white-spotted mushrooms is 7 + 4 + 6 = 17.

So, the answer is 17.
