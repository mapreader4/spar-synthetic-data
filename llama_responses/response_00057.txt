Let's break this down step by step.

Liza started with 10 kilograms of butter.

She used 1/2 of it for chocolate chip cookies. That's 5 kilograms.

She used 1/5 of it for peanut butter cookies. That's 2 kilograms.

She used 1/3 of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. That's 1 kilogram.

Now, let's subtract the amount used for each type of cookie from the total amount of butter:

10 - 5 (chocolate chip cookies) - 2 (peanut butter cookies) - 1 (sugar cookies) = 2

Answer: 2
