Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Ben has 8 more apples than Phillip does. This means that Ben has 8 + x apples, where x is the number of apples Phillip has.

We also know that Tom has three eighths as many apples as Ben has. So, Tom has 8/3 as many apples as Ben has. We can write this as a fraction: 8/3.

Now, we know that Phillip has 40 apples. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Ben has 8 + x apples
Phillip has 40 apples

Since Phillip has 40 apples, we can substitute 40 for x in the equation:

8 + x = 40

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

x = 40 - 8
x = 32

So, Tom has 32 apples.
