Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the number of apples Simone ate. Simone ate 1/2 of an apple each day for 16 days, so she ate a total of (1/2) * 16 = 8 apples.

Next, let's calculate the number of apples Lauri ate. Lauri ate 1/3 of an apple each day for 15 days, so she ate a total of (1/3) * 15 = 5 apples.

To find the total number of apples the two girls ate, we add the number of apples Simone ate to the number of apples Lauri ate: 8 + 5 = 13.

Answer: 13
