Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of seashells in the jar last week was x.

Since Carina puts 20 more seashells in the jar this week, the number of seashells in the jar this week is x + 20.

The problem asks how many seashells will be in the jar in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of seashells in the jar this week by 4 to get the number of seashells in the jar in a month.

So, the number of seashells in the jar in a month is (x + 20) * 4 = x + 80.

Answer: 80
