Let's break it down step by step.

Joe spent 1/9 of his pocket money on chocolates. 1/9 of 450 is 50. So, Joe spent 50 dollars on chocolates.

Next, he spent 2/5 of his money on fruits. 2/5 of 450 is 180. So, Joe spent 180 dollars on fruits.

To find out how much money Joe has left, we need to subtract the money he spent on chocolates and fruits from his initial amount of 450.

So, Joe has 450 - 50 - 180 = 220 dollars left.

Answer: 220
