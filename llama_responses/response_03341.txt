Let's break down the information into smaller parts.

The number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the first week is 5000.

The number of new coronavirus cases in the second week is half of the number in the first week, so it is 2500.

The number of new coronavirus cases in the third week is 2000 more than the number in the second week, so it is 4500.

To find the total number of recorded new coronavirus cases, we add up the numbers: 5000 + 2500 + 2000 = 7500.

Answer: 7500
