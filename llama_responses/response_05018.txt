Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of packs of cheese cookies in the carton. Since each box has 10 packs of cheese cookies, and there are 12 boxes in the carton, we can multiply the two numbers together to get the total number of packs of cheese cookies:

10 packs per box * 12 boxes = 120 packs of cheese cookies

Next, we need to find the cost of a pack of cheese cookies. We can do this by dividing the total cost of the carton, which is $1440, by the total number of packs of cheese cookies, which is 120.

1440 / 120 = x

To find the cost of a pack of cheese cookies, we can divide the cost of the carton by the total number of packs of cheese cookies:

1440 / 120 = 12

So, the price of a pack of cheese cookies is:
