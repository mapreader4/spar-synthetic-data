Let's break down the problem step by step.

In April, the store owner ordered 20 cases of bottles of soda. Each case contains 20 bottles. So, the total number of bottles of soda ordered in April is:

20 cases * 20 bottles/case = 20 * 20 = 400

In May, the store owner ordered 30 cases of bottles of soda. Each case contains 20 bottles. So, the total number of bottles of soda ordered in May is:

30 cases * 20 bottles/case = 30 * 20 = 600

The total number of bottles of soda ordered by the store owner in April and May is the sum of the bottles ordered in April and May:

400 + 600 = 1000

Answer: 1000
