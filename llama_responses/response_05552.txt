Let's start by adding the lengths of the first three episodes together to get the total time for the first three episodes:

58 + 62 + 65 = 185

Then, we know that the four episodes last 4 hours, so we can set up an equation to solve for the fourth episode's length:

Total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes

Since we know the total time for the first three episodes, we can set up the equation:

240 = 185 + x

To solve for x, we subtract 185 from both sides:

x = 240 - 185
x = 55

So, the fourth episode is 55 minutes long.

Answer: 55
