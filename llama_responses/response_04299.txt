Let's break this down step by step.

Kelsey had 2/5 of a tray of eggs, which is equivalent to 2/5 * 12 = 4 eggs (assuming a standard tray of eggs is 12 eggs).

Stephanie had half a tray of eggs, which is 12/2 = 6 eggs.

Alayah brought 40 more eggs than Kelsey and Stephanie combined, so she brought 4 + 6 + 40 = 50 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs used at the party, we add up the eggs from all three people: 4 + 6 + 50 = 60 eggs.

So, the total number of eggs used at the party is 60.

Answer: 60
