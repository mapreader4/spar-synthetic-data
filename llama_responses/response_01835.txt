Let's start by finding the value of the money each kid has.

Teagan has 200 pennies, which is equal to $2.

Rex has 100 nickels, which is equal to $5.

Toni has 330 dimes, which is equal to $33.

To find the total amount of money the kids have, we add the values together:

$2 + $5 + $33 = $40

So, the kids have a total of $40.
