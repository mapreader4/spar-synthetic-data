Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of packages delivered by the third butcher is x.

We know that the total weight of the ground beef delivered is 100 pounds. Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the total number of packages delivered is 100 / 4 = 25.

We know that the first butcher delivered 10 packages and the second butcher delivered 7 packages. So, the total number of packages delivered by the first two butchers is 10 + 7 = 17.

Since the total number of packages delivered is 25, and 17 packages were delivered by the first two butchers, the number of packages delivered by the third butcher is 25 - 17 = 8.

Answer: 8
