Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost per section of the hedge. Each section has 30 pieces of concrete blocks, and the cost of each piece is $2. So, the cost per section is 30 x 2 = 60.

The hedge has 8 sections. So, the total cost for all the sections is 8 x 60 = 480.

Answer: 480
