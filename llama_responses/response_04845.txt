Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the value of the wallet. The wallet is 60 dollars more than the cost of the food. So, let's say the cost of the food is x. The equation is:

60 + x = cost of wallet

The cost of the wallet is 60 more than the cost of the food, which is x. So, we can subtract 60 from both sides of the equation to get the cost of the food:

x - 60 = cost of wallet

The cost of the food is the cost of the wallet minus 60. So, the cost of the food is x - 60.

Mike also needs a shirt. The shirt costs a third of the value of the wallet. The value of the wallet is 60, so the cost of the shirt is 20. The equation is:

cost of shirt = 20

The cost of the shirt is a third of the value of the wallet, which is 60. So, the cost of the shirt is 60 รท 3 = 20.

Now, let's add the cost of the food and the cost of the shirt:

cost of food + cost of shirt = 30 + 20 = 50

So, Mike spent 50 dollars that day on shopping.
