Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to make 12 pizzas. We know that one batch of pizza dough takes 30 minutes to make, and we can make 3 pizzas with one batch. So, it will take 30 minutes to make 3 pizzas, and 4 batches to make 12 pizzas. So, it will take 4 x 30 minutes = 120 minutes = 2 hours to make 12 pizzas.

Now, we need to add the time it takes for the pizzas to cook in the oven. It takes 30 minutes for each batch of 2 pizzas, so for 6 batches of 2 pizzas, it will take 30 x 6 = 180 minutes = 3 hours to cook the pizzas.

In total, it will take Camilla 2 hours to make the pizza dough and 3 hours to cook the pizzas, so the total time is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.
