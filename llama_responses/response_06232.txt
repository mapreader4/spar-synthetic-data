Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by identifying the number of boys and girls at the party. We are told that there are as many boys as girls, so if there are 40 boys, then there are also 40 girls. 

Now, we know that each boy paid twice the money that each girl paid, so if each boy paid $50, then each girl paid $25. 

The total amount of money collected from the boys is 40 x 50 = $2000.
