Let's break it down step by step:

1. The zoo entry tickets are $5 per person, so for 2 people, the total cost of the tickets will be 2 x $5 = $10.
2. The bus fare is $1.50 per person, so for 2 people, the total cost of the bus fare will be 2 x $1.50 = $3.
3. Noah and Ava bring $40 with them, so after the tickets and bus fare, they will have $40 - ($10 + $3) = $27 left.

Answer: 27
