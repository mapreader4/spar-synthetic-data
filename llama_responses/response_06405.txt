Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total time spent by Tobias taking pauses. He took a 5-minute pause every 25 minutes. So, the total time taken for pauses is:

5 minutes * 3 = 15 minutes.

So, the total time taken for pauses is 15 minutes.

Now, let's find the total time taken for swimming. Swimming every 100 meters took him 5 minutes. So, the total time taken for swimming is:

5 minutes * (100 / 100) = 0.5 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time taken for pauses from the total time taken for swimming:

0.5 minutes - 15 minutes = 14.5 minutes.

The total time left is:

14.5 minutes.

To convert this to minutes to seconds, multiply by 60:

14.5 * 60 = 870 seconds.

Now, to find the total distance swum, multiply the total time in seconds by the speed:

870 seconds / 5 minutes = 174 meters.

So, the total distance swum is:

174 meters.

Answer: 174
