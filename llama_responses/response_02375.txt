Let's start by identifying the number of blue envelopes Wyatt has. The problem states that Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes. It also states that Wyatt has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. To find the number of yellow envelopes Wyatt has, we can subtract 4 from the number of blue envelopes. 

Blue envelopes: 10
Wyatt has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. So, blue envelopes - 4 = yellow envelopes. 

Wyatt has 10 - 4 = 6.
