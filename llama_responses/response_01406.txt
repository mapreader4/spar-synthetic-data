Let's start by thinking step by step.

Let's say the 8 toddlers Bill double-counted are toddlers that Bill already counted. So, the total number of toddlers Bill counted is 26 - 8 = 18.

Now, Bill also missed 3 toddlers. So, we need to add those 3 toddlers to the total count.

So, the total number of toddlers is 18 + 3 = 21.

Answer: 21
