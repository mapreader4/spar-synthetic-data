Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The album has 10 songs.
2. Each song is 3.5 minutes long.
3. Lucy jumps rope 1 time per second.

To find the total time of the album, we multiply the number of songs by the length of each song:

10 songs * 3.5 minutes per song = 35 minutes

To find the total number of seconds, we multiply the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

35 minutes * 60 = 2100 seconds

Now, to find the number of jumps, we divide the total seconds by the number of jumps per second:

2100 seconds / 1 = 2100 jumps

Answer: 2100
