Let's break this down step by step.

On Monday, the bird watcher sees 70 birds.

On Tuesday, he sees half as many birds as he did on Monday. Half of 70 is 35, so he sees 35 birds on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he sees 8 more birds than he did on Tuesday. So, he sees 35 + 8 = 43 birds on Wednesday.

To find the total number of birds he saw from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of birds he saw each day:

70 (Monday) + 35 (Tuesday) + 43 (Wednesday) = 148

Answer: 148
