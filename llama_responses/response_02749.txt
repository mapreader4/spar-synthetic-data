Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of baskets Alex made. Alex made 8 baskets.

Next, we are told that Sandra made three times as many baskets as Alex. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Sandra's baskets = 3 * Alex's baskets

We know Alex made 8 baskets, so we can substitute 8 into the equation:

Sandra's baskets = 3 * 8

Now, to find the number of baskets Sandra made, we multiply 3 by 8:

Sandra's baskets = 3 * 8 = 24

So Sandra made 24 baskets.

Finally, we are told that Hector made two times the number of baskets Sandra made. So, we can set up another equation to represent this:

Hector's baskets = 2 * Sandra's baskets

We know Sandra made 24 baskets, so we can substitute 24 into the equation:

Hector's baskets = 2 * 24

Now, to find the number of baskets Hector made, we multiply 2 by 24:

Hector's baskets = 2 * 24 = 48

So Hector made 48 baskets.

To find the total number of baskets they made in total, we add the number of baskets each of them made:

Alex's baskets + Sandra's baskets + Hector's baskets = 8 + 24 + 48 = 80

Answer: 80
