Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of berries they picked:

Iris picked 30 blueberries, her sister picked 20 cranberries, and her brother picked 10 raspberries. So, the total number of berries they picked is:

30 (blueberries) + 20 (cranberries) + 10 (raspberries) = 60

Now, 1/3 of the total berries are rotten. So, the rotten berries are:

60 x 1/3 = 20

So, the remaining berries that are not rotten are:

60 - 20 = 40

Now, 1/2 of the fresh berries need to be kept. So, the number of berries they will be able to sell is:

40 x 1/2 = 20

Answer: 20
