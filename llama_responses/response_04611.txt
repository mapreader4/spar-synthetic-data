Let's start by finding the number of students in the class at the end of the year. We know that 1/3 of the students transferred to other schools, so we need to find 1/3 of the original 160 students. 1/3 of 160 is 160/3 = 53. We know that 20 new students joined the class, so the number of students in the class at the end of the year is 160 - 53 = 107. 

Answer: 107
