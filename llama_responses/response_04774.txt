Let's calculate the total jump of each athlete:

Athlete 1: 26 + 30 + 7 = 63 feet
Athlete 2: 24 + 34 + 8 = 66 feet

Since Athlete 2 has a higher total jump, they are the winner.

To find the average jump of the winner, we need to divide the total jump by the number of jumps:

66 feet (total) รท 3 jumps = 22 feet

Answer: 22
