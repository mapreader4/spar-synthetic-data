Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total weight of the 20 bags of apples. Each bag weighs 60 pounds, so the total weight of the apples is 20 x 60 = 1200 pounds.

The lorry is 500 pounds when empty, so if we add the 1200 pounds of apples, we can find the total weight of the lorry when it's loaded as follows:

500 (initial weight) + 1200 (weight of apples) = 1700 pounds.

Answer: 1700
