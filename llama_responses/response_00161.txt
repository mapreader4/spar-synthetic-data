Let's break down the problem step by step.

The town's annual budget totals $32 million. We know that half of the budget goes towards policing, so we can write that as an equation: 1/2 * 32 million = 16 million.

We also know that $12 million goes towards education, so we can write that as an equation: 12 million.

Now, we want to find out how much money is left for managing public spaces. We can subtract the amount of money that goes towards policing and education from the total budget:

$32 million - 16 million - 12 million = 4 million.

Answer: 4 million.
