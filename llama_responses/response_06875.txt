Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the herring has 40 oz of fat, an eel 20 oz, and a pike 10 oz more than an eel. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Let's let e be the number of oz of fat in the pike.

Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

40 + 20 + (e + 10) = 40 + 20 + e

Since we know that 40 oz of fat is served for each fish, and there are 40 fish, we know that the total amount of fat served is 40 * 40 = 1600 oz.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 1600
