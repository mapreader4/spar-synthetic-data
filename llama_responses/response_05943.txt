Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Carly had 42 lollipops.
* Half of the lollipops were cherry, which is 42 รท 2 = 21.
* The rest of the lollipops are not cherry, which is 42 - 21 = 21.
* The remaining 21 lollipops are not cherry, and are equal amounts of watermelon, sour apple, and grape. Since they are equal, we can divide 21 by 3 (the number of flavors) to find the number of lollipops in each flavor: 21 รท 3 = 7.

So, the number of grape lollipops is 7.

Answer: 7
