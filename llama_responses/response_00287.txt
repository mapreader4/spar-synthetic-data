Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find out how much of the tuition fee is covered by the scholarship. 30% of the tuition fee is 30/100 * 90 = 27. So, the scholarship covers 27 dollars.

Step 2: Find out how much Bran needs to pay. 90 - 27 = 63.

Step 3: Since Bran needs to pay his tuition fee within 3 months, we can divide the remaining amount by 3 to find out how much he needs to pay each month. 63 / 3 = 21.

Answer: 21
