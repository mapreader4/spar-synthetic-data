Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Tina wins her first 10 fights, so she has 10 wins.
2. She then wins 5 more fights before losing her first loss, so she now has 15 wins.
3. She then doubles her number of wins, which means she now has 30 wins.
4. She loses again, which means she has now lost 1 fight.
5. At the end of her career, she has a total of 30 wins and 1 loss.

To find the answer, we need to subtract the number of losses from the total number of wins. 30 - 1 = 29.

Answer: 29
