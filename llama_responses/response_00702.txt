Let's break it down step by step.

Lily started with $55 in her account.

She spent $7 on a shirt, so she has $55 - $7 = $48 left.

Then, she went to another shop and spent thrice as much as she spent on a shirt. "Thrice" means three times, so she spent 3 times the amount she spent on the first shirt, which was $7. 3 x $7 = $21.

So, she spent a total of $7 + $21 = $28 on two shirts.

She has $48 - $28 = $20 left in her account.

Answer: 20
