Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The number of puppies: 7
* The total amount of formula given: 105
* The number of days: 5

We need to find out how many times a day Sandra should feed the puppies. To do this, we can divide the total amount of formula by the number of days and the number of puppies.

Let's divide 105 by 5: 105 รท 5 = 21

So, Sandra should feed the puppies 21 times a day.
