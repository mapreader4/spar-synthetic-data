Let's break this down step by step.

Jason wants to know how much he'll have to pay each month. We know that the car costs $32,000 and he's paying $8,000 upfront. So, the amount he needs a loan for is $24,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much interest he'll have to pay each month. He'll be paying 48 equal payments, and each payment will include interest. We can set up an equation to solve for this. Let's say the interest is 5% of the payment. We can use the formula for simple interest:

P = P * (1 + r)^n

Where P is the payment, r is the rate of interest, and n is the number of payments.

We know the payment is $48, and we want to find the interest rate. We can set up an equation:

48 = P * (1 + r)^48

We can start by plugging in the known values. We know the payment is $48, so:

48 = P * (1 + r)^48

We can divide both sides of the equation by 48 to get:

1 = (1 + r)^48

We can take the square root of both sides to get:

r = (1/48)^0.0224

r = 0.0224

Now we can plug this back into our original equation:

P = P * (1 + 0.0224)^48

We can plug in the payment, which is $48:

48 = P * (1 + 0.0224)^48

48 = P * 1.1225

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.1225 to get:

P = 42.67

So, Jason's monthly payment will be $42.67.
