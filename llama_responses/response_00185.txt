Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Caleb caught 2 trouts.  His dad caught 3 times as much as Caleb, so his dad caught 3 * 2 = 6 trouts.

To find out how many more trouts his dad caught compared to Caleb, we need to subtract the number of trouts Caleb caught from the number of trouts his dad caught.  So, we do 6 - 2 = 4.

So, the answer is: Answer: 4
