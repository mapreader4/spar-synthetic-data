Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of sessions needed for the first two patients.

The first patient needs 6 sessions.
The second patient needs 5 more sessions than the first patient, so the second patient needs 6 + 5 = 11 sessions.

The total number of sessions for the first two patients is 6 + 11 = 17.

The remaining patients need 25 - 17 = 8 sessions.

Answer: 8
