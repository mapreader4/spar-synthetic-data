Let's break this problem down step by step.

There are 2 Goldfish and each gets 1 teaspoon of food, so that's a total of 2 teaspoons of food for the Goldfish.

There are 3 Swordtails and each gets 2 teaspoons of food, so that's a total of 6 teaspoons of food for the Swordtails.

There are 8 Guppies and each eats half a teaspoon of food, which is 0.5 teaspoons. To find the total food for the Guppies, we multiply 0.5 by 8, which gives us 4 teaspoons of food for the Guppies.

Now, let's add up the total amount of food for each type of fish:

2 teaspoons for the Goldfish + 6 teaspoons for the Swordtails + 4 teaspoons for the Guppies = 12 teaspoons of food in total.

Answer: 12
