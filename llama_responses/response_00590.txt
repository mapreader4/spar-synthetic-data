Let's break it down step by step.

There are 25 milk chocolate bars, 25 dark chocolate bars, 25 milk chocolate with almond bars, and 25 white chocolate bars. To find the percentage of each type of chocolate bar, we need to find the total number of chocolate bars in total.

The total number of chocolate bars is 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100.

Now, let's find the percentage of each type of chocolate bar.

The percentage of milk chocolate bars is (25/100) = 25%.

The percentage of dark chocolate bars is (25/100) = 25%.

The percentage of milk chocolate with almond bars is (25/100) = 25%.

The percentage of white chocolate bars is (25/100) = 25%.

Answer: 25, 25, 25, 25.
