Let's break this down step by step.

John's bench press starts at 500 pounds. 80% of 500 is 400 pounds. So, his bench press goes down 400 pounds.

After a bit of training, John manages to triple the weight he can bench. So, the new weight is 400 * 3 = 1200 pounds.

So, John's new bench press is 1200 pounds.

Answer: 1200
