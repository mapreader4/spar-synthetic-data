Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the profit in the second quarter as x.

The store had profits of $1,500 in the first quarter, $3,000 in the third quarter, and $2,000 in the fourth quarter. The total profit for the year is $8,000.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

1,500 + x + 3,000 + 2,000 = 8,000

To solve for x, we can subtract 1,500 and 2,000 from both sides of the equation:

1,500 + x = 8,000 - 3,000 - 2,000

This simplifies to:

x = 8,000 - 3,000 - 2,000 - 1,500

x = 2,500

Answer: 2,500
