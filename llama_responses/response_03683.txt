Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the total number of people at the party. There are 50 people at the party.

Step 2: Let's find the number of boys at the party. 30% of 50 is the same as 30/100 * 50. So, 30/100 * 50 = 15.

Step 3: So, the number of boys at the party is 15.

Answer: 15
