Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of each type of daisy.

We know that there are 6 white daisies. Since there are nine times as many pink daisies as white daisies, that means there are 6 x 9 = 54 pink daisies.

We also know that there are three less than four times as many red daisies as pink daisies, so there are 54 x 4 - 3 = 207 red daisies.

The total number of daisies is the sum of the number of white, pink, and red daisies. That is, 6 + 54 + 207 = 267.

Answer: 267
