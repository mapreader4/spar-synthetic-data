Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: John used to buy 4 coffees a day for $2 each, so his daily cost was 4 * 2 = $8.

Step 2: The price of the coffee increased by 50%, so the new price is 1.5 * 2 = $3.

Step 3: John now buys half the number of coffees, so he now buys 2 coffees a day.

Step 4: The new daily cost is 2 * 3 = $6.

Step 5: The difference between the old and new costs is $8 - $6 = $2.
