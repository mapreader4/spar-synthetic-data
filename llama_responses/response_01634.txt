Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the cost of each cup of lemonade. Since she spent $20 on ingredients, and she makes lemonade for $2 per cup, then the cost of one cup is $20 / 2 = $10.

Now, she wants to make a profit of $80. So, if she sells lemonade for $10 per cup, she needs to sell:

$80 / $10 = 8 cups.

Answer: 8
