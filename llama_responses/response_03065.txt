Let's break this down step by step:

1. Tom originally could lift 80 kg per hand, which means he could lift 160 kg with both hands.
2. After training, he was able to double his weight, which means he could lift 160 * 2 = 320 kg with both hands.
3. He then decided to specialize and was able to get an extra 10% increase in his lifting ability, which means he could lift 320 * 1.1 = 352 kg with both hands.

Answer: 352
