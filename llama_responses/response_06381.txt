Let's start by using the information that the standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle.

We know that the standard poodle is 28 inches tall. So, we can set up an equation to find the height of the miniature poodle:

28 - 8 = x

This means that the miniature poodle is 20 inches tall.

Now, we know that the toy poodle is 6 inches taller than the miniature poodle. So, we can add 6 to the height of the miniature poodle to find the height of the toy poodle:

20 + 6 = 26

Answer: 26
