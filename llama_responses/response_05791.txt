Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Last year, walkers earned $4 a mile.
* This year, walkers earn $2.75 a mile.
* Last year's winner collected $44.

We are asked to find the number of miles Elroy needs to walk to collect the same amount of money as last year's winner.

Let's start by finding the total distance last year's winner walked to earn $44:

$44 / $4 = 22 miles

So last year's winner walked 22 miles.

Now, we know that Elroy earns $2.75 a mile. To find the number of miles he needs to walk to collect the same amount of money, we can set up an equation:

$2.75x = $44

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by $2.75:

x = $44 / $2.75

x = 16

So Elroy needs to walk 16 miles to collect the same amount of money as last year's winner.
