To find the amount of money Jenny makes after factoring in expenses, we need to calculate the total revenue she earns from selling 20 pans of lasagna and then subtract the cost of making 20 pans.

The total revenue Jenny earns is 20 pans * $25.00 per pan = $500.00.

The cost of making 20 pans is $10.00 * 20 = $200.00.

So, the net profit Jenny makes is $500.00 - $200.00 = $300.00.

Answer: 300.
