Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of guests, which is 60.

We know that half of the guests are women, so we can find the number of women by multiplying 60 by 0.5, which gives us 30.

We also know that 15 are men, so the number of men is given.

The number of children is the total number of guests minus the number of women and men, so we can subtract 30 + 15 from 60 to find the number of children, which is 15.

Now, in the middle of the celebration, 1/3 of the men and 5 children left. So, 1/3 of the men is 1/3 * 15 = 5. The number of children who left is 5.

Now, let's find the number of people who stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration. We have the total number of women, which is 30, the number of men who stayed, which is 15 - 5 = 10, and the number of children who stayed, which is 15 - 5 = 10. We can add these together to get the total number of people who stayed, which is 30 + 10 + 10 = 50.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 50
