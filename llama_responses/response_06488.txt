Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find out how many boxes the organization can pack with the initial amount of money. Each box contains $80 worth of food and $165 worth of additional supplies, so the total cost of each box is $80 + $165 = $245. The organization has an initial amount of money that is enough to pack 400 boxes.

Next, let's find out how much money the organization has initially. The cost of 400 boxes is 400 x $245 = $98000. So, the organization has $98000 initially.

Now, an anonymous donor gives the organization 4 times the amount of money they had already spent. So, the organization receives 4 x $98000 = $392000.

The organization now has a total of $98000 + $392000 = $502000. With this amount of money, let's find out how many boxes they can pack. The cost of each box is $245, so they can pack $502000 / $245 = 2053 boxes.

However, this includes the 400 boxes they had initially planned to pack. So, the total number of boxes they can pack is 2053 - 400 = 1653.

Answer: 1653
