Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of visitors in one day. Since the zoo is open for 8 hours and 50 visitors enter every hour, the total number of visitors in one day is:

50 * 8 = 400

So, the total number of visitors in one day is 400.

Next, we need to find the number of visitors who go to the gorilla exhibit. We know that 80% of the total visitors go to the gorilla exhibit. So, we can set up an equation:

80% of 400 = x

To solve for x, we can multiply 0.8 by 400:

0.8 * 400 = x

x = 320

Answer: 320
