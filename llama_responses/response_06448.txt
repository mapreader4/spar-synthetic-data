Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of kids' tickets. The problem states that there are 6 kids, so the number of kids' tickets is 6.

Next, let's identify the number of adult tickets. The problem states that the adult tickets are on sale for only half of the adult tickets. This means that the number of adult tickets is 2. The total cost is $50, so we can set up an equation to solve for the price of one kid's ticket.

Let's set up the equation: 2 adult tickets + 6 kids' tickets = 50. Let's simplify the equation to 2 + 6k = 50, where k is the price of one kid's ticket.

To solve for k, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 6 = 50 - 2. This gives us k = 24.

So, the price of one kid's ticket is 24.
