Let's start by adding the number of cookies each of them baked initially. Alice baked 74 chocolate chip cookies and Bob baked 7 peanut butter cookies, so together they had 74 cookies. Then, Alice baked 5 more cookies and Bob baked 36 more. So, the total number of cookies they had is 74 + 5 + 36 = 115. Since they had 93 cookies at the end, we can find the number of cookies that were thrown on the floor by subtracting 93 from 115. 115 - 93 = 22. So, 22 cookies were accidentally thrown on the floor.
