Let's break this down step by step.

Jonah bought 6 pineapples for $3 each, so the total cost of the pineapples is 6 x 3 = 18 dollars.

Each pineapple could be cut into 12 pineapple rings, so the total number of rings is 6 * 12 = 72.

Jonah sold 4 pineapple rings for $5 each, so the total revenue from the sale of the pineapple rings is 4 * 5 = 20 dollars.

The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost, so the profit is 20 - 18 = 2 dollars.
