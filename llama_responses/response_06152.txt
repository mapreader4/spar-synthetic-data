Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Kayla and Kylie picked 200 apples in total. We also know that Kayla picked 1/4 of the apples that Kylie picked.

Let's let's call the number of apples that Kylie picked "x". Since Kylie picked 1/4 of the apples, we know that Kylie picked x/4 apples.

We can set up an equation to represent this information. Let's say:

x + (x/4) = 200

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 4:

4x = 800

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 200/4

x = 50

Answer: 50
