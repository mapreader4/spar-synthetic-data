Let's start by identifying the number of students in each group.

The first group has 5 students.
The second group has 8 students.
The third group has 7 students.

The total number of students is the sum of the students in each group.

5 + 8 + 7 = 20

So, the fourth group has 24 - 20 = 4 students.
