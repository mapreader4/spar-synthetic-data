Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that it takes Derek 9 minutes to walk 1 mile without his brother. We also know that it takes him 12 minutes to walk 1 mile with his brother. We can use these two pieces of information to set up a ratio to find the time it takes Derek to walk 1 mile with his brother. The ratio is 12 minutes to 9 minutes, or 4:3.

To find the time it takes Derek to walk 2 miles with his brother, we can multiply the time it takes him to walk 1 mile by 2. This gives us 24 minutes. To find the time it takes him to walk 20 miles with his brother, we can multiply the time it takes him to walk 2 miles by 10. This gives us 240 minutes.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 240
