Let's break it down step by step.

On the first 6 days, Tim's website got 100 visitors per day. So, the total number of visitors for the first 6 days is 6 * 100 = 600.

On the last day, it got twice as many visitors as every other day combined. That means it got 6 * 100 + 6 * 100 = 1200 visitors on the last day.

So, the total number of visitors on the last day is 1200.

The total number of visitors for the entire week is the sum of the visitors for the first 6 days and the visitors on the last day. So, the total is 600 + 1200 = 1800.

Now, to find the total amount of money Tim made, we multiply the total number of visitors by the cost per visit, which is $.01. So, the total amount of money Tim made is 1800 *.01 = 18.

Answer: 18
