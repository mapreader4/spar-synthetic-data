Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of hawksbill turtles taken: 2 times the number of green turtles.

The number of green turtles is given as 800. To find the number of hawksbill turtles taken, we multiply 2 by 800.

2 x 800 = 1600

So, the number of hawksbill turtles taken into the conservation center is 1600.

Answer: 1600
