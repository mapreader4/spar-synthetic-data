Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the variables:

* The total number of points needed to win the movie day is 200.
* The number of students in the class is 25.
* The number of school weeks is 2, which is equivalent to 10 days.
* The number of points earned per day is 2 for each student who eats their vegetables.

Let's first find the total number of points the class needs to earn in 10 days:

200 points / 10 days = 20 points per day

Since there are 25 students in the class, the class needs to earn a total of 20 points per day to reach the goal. Since each student earns 2 points for eating their vegetables, the number of vegetables each student needs to eat per day is:

20 points per day / 2 points per student = 10 vegetables per day

So, the answer is:

Answer: 10
