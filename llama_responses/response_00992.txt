Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many cups of banana mush she can make with 20 bananas. Since it takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush, we can find the number of cups by dividing 20 by 4:

20 bananas รท 4 = 5 cups of mush

So, Hannah can make 5 cups of banana mush with 20 bananas.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of flour she should use for 5 cups of mush. We know that it takes 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. So, we can multiply 5 by 3 to find the total amount of flour needed:

5 cups of mush * 3 = 15 cups of flour

So, Hannah should use 15 cups of flour for 20 bananas.
