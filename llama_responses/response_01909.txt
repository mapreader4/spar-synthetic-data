Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of kids who finish in less than 6 minutes. 10% of the kids finish in less than 6 minutes. 10% of 40 kids is 4 kids. Then, three times that number, 12 kids, finish in less than 8 minutes. 

Now, let's find the number of kids who finish in more than 14 minutes. 1/6 of the remaining kids, 20 kids, take more than 14 minutes.

The number of kids who finish in more than 14 minutes is 20 - 4 - 12 = 4 kids.
