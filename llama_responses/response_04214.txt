Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the information given to us:

* 4 maths books at $20 each
* 6 science books at $10 each
* 2 times as many art books as maths books, so 2 * 4 = 8 art books at $20 each

Let's calculate the total cost of the maths books:
4 x $20 = $80
6 x $10 = $60
8 x $20 = $160

The total cost of the maths books is $80 + $60 + $160 = $200.

But the problem asks for the cost of music books. The problem does not mention the cost of music books. So, the answer is 0.
