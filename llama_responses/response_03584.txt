Let's break it down step by step.

Mary earns $20 washing cars and $40 walking dogs each month. So, her total monthly income is $20 + $40 = $60.

She puts half of that money away each month, which is $60/2 = $30.

To find out how many months it would take her to save $150, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($150) by the amount she saves each month ($30).

$150 รท $30 = 5.

So, it would take Mary 5 months to save $150.
