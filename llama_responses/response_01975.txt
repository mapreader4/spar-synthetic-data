Let's break this down step by step.

1. Tony puts $1,000 in a savings account for 1 year. So, the initial amount is $1,000.
2. The account earns 20% interest, which is 20% of $1,000, which is $200.
3. So, the total amount after 1 year is $1,000 + $200 = $1,200.
4. Tony takes out half the money, which is half of $1,200, which is $600.
5. So, the remaining amount is $1,200 - $600 = $600.
6. The next year, the remaining $600 earns 15% interest, which is 15% of $600, which is $90.
7. So, the final amount is $600 + $90 = $690.

Answer: 690
