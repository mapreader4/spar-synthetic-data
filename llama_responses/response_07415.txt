Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of minutes it took Dad to vacuum upstairs be x. Then, since he vacuumed for a total of 38 minutes, we can set up the equation 2x + x = 38.

We know that Dad vacuumed for a total of 5 more minutes upstairs than downstairs. So, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get the number of minutes he vacuumed upstairs: x - 5 = 38 - 5.

x = 33.

So, the answer is: Answer: 33
