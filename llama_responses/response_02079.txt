Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cookies Kristy baked. Let's call this number x.

We know that Kristy ate 2 cookies, so we can subtract 2 from x. So, we have x - 2 = 6 - 2 = x - 2.

Her brother took 1 cookie, so we can subtract 1 from x - 2. x - 2 - 1 = x - 3.

The first friend took 3 cookies, so we can subtract 3 from x - 3. x - 3 - 3 = x - 0.

The second and third friends took 5 cookies each, so we can subtract 5 * 2 from x - 0. x - 0 - 10 = x - 10.

Now, we know that Kristy baked x cookies. We can add up all the cookies that were taken by Kristy's friends. Kristy's brother took 1, the first friend took 3, and the second and third friends took 5 each, for a total of 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 14 cookies. But we know that there are 6 cookies left. So, we can subtract 14 from x. x - 10 - 14 = 4.

So, the answer is: Answer: 16
