Let's start by letting x be the amount of money saved by Sam.

Victory saves $100 less than Sam, so Sam saves x + 100.

The total money saved for holiday spending is the sum of the money saved by Victory and Sam.

The equation to solve for the total money saved is x + (x + 100).

We know that the total money saved is $1000. So, we can set up the equation as x + (x + 100) = 1000.

To solve for x, we can subtract 100 from both sides of the equation.

x + (x + 100) = 1000

x + 100 = 900

Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get:

x = 800

Answer: 800
