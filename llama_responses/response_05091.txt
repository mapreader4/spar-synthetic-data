Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Paul needs 3 layer cakes, which requires 3 cans of frosting.
2. He needs 6 dozen cupcakes, which is 6 x 12 = 72 cupcakes. For each cupcake, he uses half a can of frosting, so he needs 72 / 2 = 36 cans of frosting for the cupcakes.
3. He needs 12 single cakes, which is 12 cakes. Each cake requires half a can of frosting, so he needs 12 / 2 = 6 cans of frosting for the single cakes.
4. He needs 18 pans of brownies, which is 18 pans. Each pan requires half a can of frosting, so he needs 18 / 2 = 9 cans of frosting for the brownies.

To find the total number of cans of frosting needed, we add the number of cans needed for each item:

3 + 36 + 6 + 9 = 50

Answer: 50
