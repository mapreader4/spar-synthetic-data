Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of calories Jacob ate:

400 + 900 + 1100 = 1400

Since Jacob was trying to eat less than 1800 calories a day, and he ate 1400 calories, he ate more than 1800 calories. So, we need to find the difference between the calories he ate and the target calories.

1800 - 1400 = 400

So, Jacob ate 400 calories more than he planned.
