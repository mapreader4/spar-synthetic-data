Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the total amount of fence, which is 100 feet.

Tom's friend Ben whitewashed 10 feet. This means that 100 - 10 = 90 feet are left.

Then, Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence. 90 divided by 5 is 18. So, 18 feet were whitewashed, leaving 72 feet left.

Johnny whitewashed a third of the fence that was left after that. 72 divided by 3 is 24. So, 24 feet were whitewashed, leaving 48 feet left.

So, 48 feet need to be whitewashed.
