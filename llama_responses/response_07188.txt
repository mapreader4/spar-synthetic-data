Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Kem earns 4 dollars per hour. We are also given that Shem makes 2.5 times more money than Kem, which means that Shem makes 4 * 2.5 = 10 dollars per hour.

To find the amount Shem earns for an 8-hour workday, we can multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked:

10 * 8 = 80

Answer: 80
