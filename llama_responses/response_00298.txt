Let's break it down step by step:

1. There were some sweets on the table initially.
2. Jack came and took half of all the candies. So, half of the sweets were taken away.
3. 4 more candies were taken by Jack, which means the total number of sweets taken by Jack is 1/2 + 4 = 6.
4. Then, Paul came and took the remaining 7 sweets.
5. So, there were 7 sweets left on the table after Paul took the remaining sweets.

To find the initial number of sweets, we need to add the number of sweets taken by Jack (6) to the number of sweets taken by Paul (7), which is 6 + 7 = 13. So, there were 13 - 6 = 7 sweets on the table initially.

Answer: 7
