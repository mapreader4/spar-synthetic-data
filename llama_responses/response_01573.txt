Let's break this problem down step by step.

On Monday, Oliver worked out for 4 hours.

On Tuesday, Oliver worked out for 2 hours less than Monday, so he worked out for 4 - 2 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, Oliver worked out twice as much as on Monday, so he worked out 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

On Thursday, Oliver worked out at home and took twice as much time as on Tuesday, so he worked out 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total hours Oliver worked out in these four days, we add up the hours:

4 (Monday) + 2 (Tuesday) + 8 (Wednesday) + 4 (Thursday) = 18

Answer: 18
