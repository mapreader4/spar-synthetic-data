Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. We know that one horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day, so 80 horses will produce 80 x 5 = 400 gallons of fertilizer per day.

2. We know that each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer, and Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. So, to cover 20 acres, she'll need 20 x 400 = 8000 gallons of fertilizer.

3. We know that Janet has 400 gallons of fertilizer per day, so it will take her 8000 / 400 = 20 days to collect enough fertilizer.

4. We know that Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day, so it will take her 20 / 4 = 5 days to spread the fertilizer over 20 acres.

5. Therefore, it will take Janet 20 + 5 = 25 days to collect and spread the fertilizer.

Answer: 25
