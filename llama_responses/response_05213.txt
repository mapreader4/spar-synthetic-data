Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, Jon can throw a fastball at 80 miles per hour.

After the first 4 weeks of training, he can throw a fastball at 80 mph.

After the second 4 weeks of training, he can throw a fastball at 80 mph + some amount of speed gained.

After the third 4 weeks of training, he can throw a fastball at 80 mph + 2x the amount of speed gained in the first 4 weeks.

After the fourth 4 weeks of training, he can throw a fastball at 80 mph + 3x the amount of speed gained in the first 4 weeks.

The problem states that after the last 4 weeks of training, Jon can throw a ball 20% faster than he could before the last 4 weeks of training. This means that the speed gained in the last 4 weeks is 20% of the initial speed, which is 0.20 x 80 = 16 mph.

Since the speed gained in the last 4 weeks is equal to the total speed gained in all 4 weeks, we can set up the equation:

16 = 4x the amount of speed gained in each week

To find the speed gained per week, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

16 รท 4 = x

x = 4

So, Jon gained 4 mph of speed per week.
