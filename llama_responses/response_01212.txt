Let's break it down step by step.

Darren bought 4 boxes of crackers. Each box has 24 crackers. So, 4 * 24 = 96 crackers. If Calvin bought one box less than twice as many boxes of crackers as Darren, that means he bought 2 boxes of crackers. So, 4 - 2 = 2 boxes. So, the total number of crackers he bought is 96 + 2 = 98.

Answer: 98
