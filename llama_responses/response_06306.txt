Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Apples weigh 4 ounces each
* Oranges weigh 3 ounces each
* Each bag can hold 49 ounces of fruit before it splits

We want to find the number of apples Martha should buy to put an equal number of apples and oranges in each bag, and she wants to buy 3 full bags.

Let's first find the total number of ounces of fruit she can put in each bag:

49 ounces per bag / 2 = 24.5 ounces per bag (since she wants an equal number of apples and oranges)

Since apples weigh 4 ounces each, the number of apples she can put in each bag is:

24.5 ounces / 4 ounces per apple = 6.125 apples per bag

Since she wants 3 full bags, she should buy:

6.125 apples * 3 = 18.375 apples

Since she can't buy a fraction of an apple, she should buy 18 apples.

Answer: 18
