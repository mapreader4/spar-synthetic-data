Let's start by calculating the number of daisy plants that will germinate.

60% of 25 daisy seeds is 15 daisy seeds. So, 15 daisy seeds will germinate.

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflower plants that will germinate.

80% of 25 sunflower seeds is 20 sunflower seeds. So, 20 sunflower seeds will germinate.

Now, let's calculate the number of plants that will produce flowers.

Of the 15 daisy plants, 80% will produce flowers. That's 12 daisy plants.

Of the 20 sunflower plants, 80% will produce flowers. That's 16 sunflower plants.

In total, 12 daisy plants and 16 sunflower plants will produce flowers.
