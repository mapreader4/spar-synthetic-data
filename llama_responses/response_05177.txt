Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of correct answers in the exam is x.

Sylvia got one-fifth of incorrect answers, so she got x - x/5 = 1/5x = 0.2x incorrect answers.

Sergio got 4 mistakes, which is the same as the number of incorrect answers.

We know that the total number of questions in the exam is 50.

So, the number of correct answers is 50 - 4 = 46.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of correct answers between Sergio and Sylvia by subtracting the number of correct answers of Sylvia from the total number of correct answers:

46 - 0.2x = 0.8x.

To find the number of correct answers that Sergio has more than Sylvia, we can add 0.2x to both sides of the equation:

0.8x = 0.8x + 0.2x.

This is 1.6x, which is the number of correct answers that Sergio has more than Sylvia.

Answer: 6.
