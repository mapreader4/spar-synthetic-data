Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Amanda had 7 candy bars initially.
* She gave 3 to her sister.
* She bought 30 more candy bars with the prize money.
* She gave her sister 4 times as many candy bars as she did the first time.

Let's calculate the number of candy bars Amanda kept for herself.

First, let's find out how many candy bars Amanda gave to her sister the second time around. She gave her sister 4 times as many candy bars as she did the first time, which was 3. So, she gave her sister 3 * 4 = 12 candy bars the second time around.

Now, let's find the total number of candy bars Amanda gave to her sister. She gave 3 the first time and 12 the second time. So, the total number of candy bars she gave to her sister is 3 + 12 = 15.

Finally, let's subtract the number of candy bars Amanda gave to her sister from the total number of candy bars she had initially. Amanda had 7 candy bars initially, and she gave away 15. So, the number of candy bars Amanda kept for herself is 7 - 15 = -8.
