Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cookies that the adults eat. They eat 1/3 of the total cookies, so we can find the number of cookies they eat by multiplying the total number of cookies (120) by 1/3.

1/3 of 120 cookies is 40 cookies.

Now, we know that the adults eat 40 cookies. This leaves 120 - 40 = 80 cookies left.

The remaining cookies are then given to the 4 children to divide equally. To find the number of cookies each child gets, we can divide 80 cookies by 4 children.

80 รท 4 = 20

Answer: 20
