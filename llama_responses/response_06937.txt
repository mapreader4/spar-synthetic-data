Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the price of one kilogram of sugar. We know that the price of two kilograms of sugar and five kilograms of salt is $5.50. We can let's say that the price of one kilogram of sugar is x. Then, the price of two kilograms of sugar is 2x. The price of five kilograms of salt is given to us, so we can say that the price of a kilogram of salt is 5 - 2x.

We can set up the equation to solve for x. We have the equation: 2x + 5 - 2x = 5.50. We can add 2x to both sides of the equation to get 3x - 5 = 5.50. We can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get 3x = 10.50.

So, the price of one kilogram of sugar is $3.50. Now, we can find the price of three kilograms of sugar and a kilogram of salt. We can multiply the price of one kilogram of sugar by 3, which is 3 * 3.50 = 10.50. Then, we add the price of a kilogram of salt, which is 1.50. So, the price of three kilograms of sugar and a kilogram of salt is $11.50.

Answer: 11.50
