Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Steve has 100 gold bars.
Step 2: 20 gold bars are lost on the way back to San Diego, so we subtract 20 from 100 to get 80.
Step 3: We have 80 gold bars left.
Step 4: Steve wants to distribute these 80 gold bars to his 4 friends.
Step 5: To find out how many gold bars each friend gets, we divide 80 by 4.
Step 6: 80 divided by 4 is 20.

Answer: 20
