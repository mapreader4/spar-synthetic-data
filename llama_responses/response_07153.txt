Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the labor. The labor cost is 2 hours at $75 per hour, so the total labor cost is 2 x 75 = 150 dollars.

Next, we need to add the cost of the part to the labor cost. The part cost $150.

The total cost is the sum of the labor cost and the part cost, which is 150 + 150 = 300.

So, Mark paid 300 dollars.
