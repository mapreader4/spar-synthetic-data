Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total cost of the candy bars Jen buys:

50 candy bars * 80 cents each = 4000 cents

Then, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 48 candy bars:

48 candy bars * 1 dollar each = 48 dollars

Now, let's subtract the cost from the revenue:

48 dollars - 4000 cents = -4352 cents

So, the profit is:

4352 cents.
