Let's break this down step by step.

Jim runs 5 miles a day for 30 days, which is a total of 5 x 30 = 150 miles.

Then, he runs 10 miles a day for the next 30 days, which is a total of 10 x 30 = 300 miles.

Finally, he runs 20 miles a day for the last 30 days, which is a total of 20 x 30 = 600 miles.

To find the total number of miles Jim runs in 90 days, we add up these three parts: 150 + 300 + 600 = 1050.

Answer: 1050
