Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total time it takes Stephen to ride his bicycle to church. Since each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, and there are 3 thirds, the total time is:

15 minutes/3 = 5 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 5 minutes to hours:

5 minutes / 60 = 0.083 hours

Now, let's find the distance Stephen travels during the first third of his trip. He travels at a speed of 16 miles per hour, and the time is 0.083 hours. We can multiply these two values to find the distance:

Distance = Speed x Time = 16 miles/hour x 0.083 hours = 1.328 miles

Since this is the first third of his trip, the distance for the first third is 1.328 miles.

Next, we need to find the distance Stephen travels during the second third of his trip. He travels at a speed of 12 miles per hour, and the time is still 0.083 hours. We can multiply these two values to find the distance:

Distance = Speed x Time = 12 miles/hour x 0.083 hours = 1 miles

Since this is the second third of his trip, the distance for the second third is 1 mile.

Finally, we need to find the distance Stephen travels during the last third of his trip. He travels at a speed of 20 miles per hour, and the time is still 0.083 hours. We can multiply these two values to find the distance:

Distance = Speed x Time = 20 miles/hour x 0.083 hours = 1.67 miles

Since this is the last third of his trip, the distance for the last third is 1.67 miles.

To find the total distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, we can add the distances for each third:

Total Distance = Distance for first third + Distance for second third + Distance for last third
= 1.328 miles + 1 mile + 1.67 miles
= 3.998 miles
