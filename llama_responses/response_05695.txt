Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of chips is 10 (just for the sake of simplicity).

The ratio is 4:6, which means that for every 4 chips, Lyle gets 6 chips. So, if there are 10 chips in total, we can say that Lyle gets 6/4 = 1.5 times 4 = 6 chips.

To find the percentage of chips that Lyle has, we can divide the number of chips he has (6) by the total number of chips (10), and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

6 / 10 * 100 = 60.

Answer: 60
