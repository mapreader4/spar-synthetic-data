To solve this problem, I will start by finding the cost of the pencils each student wants.

Tolu wants 3 pencils, and each pencil costs 20 cents, so Tolu will spend 3 x 20 cents = 60 cents.

Robert wants 5 pencils, and each pencil also costs 20 cents, so Robert will spend 5 x 20 cents = 100 cents.

Melissa wants 2 pencils, and each pencil also costs 20 cents, so Melissa will spend 2 x 20 cents = 40 cents.

To find the total amount the students will spend, I will add the amounts together:

60 cents + 100 cents + 40 cents = 200 cents.

Answer: 2.00
