Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money that the store would have made if they sold all 2000 items at the normal price of $50 each:

2000 items x $50 per item = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the amount of money they would have made with the 80% discount:

$100,000 x 0.8 = $80,000

Now, let's calculate the amount of money they actually made, since they sold 90% of the items:

$80,000 x 0.9 = $72,000

The store owes $15,000 to their creditors, so we subtract that from the amount they made:

$72,000 - $15,000 = $57,000

Therefore, the store has $57,000 left after the sale.

Answer: 57,000
