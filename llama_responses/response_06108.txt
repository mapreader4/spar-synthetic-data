Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's apartment. This means that if Heidi's apartment has x rooms, then Danielle's apartment also has x rooms.

Grant's apartment has 1/9 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment. This means that Grant's apartment has 3/9 of Heidi's rooms. Since Grant's apartment has 2 rooms, it follows that 2 * 3 = 6 rooms.

Since Grant's apartment has 2 rooms, Danielle's apartment also has 2 * 3 = 6 rooms.
