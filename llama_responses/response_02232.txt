Let's break this down step by step.

On Monday, Adam had 6 lessons of 30 minutes each, which is 6 x 30 = 180 minutes. On Tuesday, he had 3 lessons of 1 hour each, which is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. On Wednesday, he spent twice as much time as on Tuesday, so he spent 2 x 180 = 360 minutes.

In total, Adam spent 180 + 180 + 360 = 720 minutes at school. To convert this to hours, we divide 720 by 60, which is 12 hours.
