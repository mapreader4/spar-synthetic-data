Let's break it down step by step.

The club starts with a balance of $100 million.

The club sells 2 players at $10 million each, which is a total of 2 x $10 million = $20 million.

So, the new balance is $100 million - $20 million = $80 million.

The club then buys 4 players at $15 million each, which is a total of 4 x $15 million = $60 million.

So, the new balance is $80 million - $60 million = $20 million.
