Let's break this down step by step:

1. Alex gets paid $500 a week.
2. 10% of his weekly income is deducted as tax, so 10% of 500 is 50, so he is left with 500 - 50 = 450.
3. He pays his weekly water bill for $55.
4. He gives away another 10% of his weekly income as a tithe, so 10% of 500 is 50, so he is left with 450 - 50 = 400.

Answer: 400
