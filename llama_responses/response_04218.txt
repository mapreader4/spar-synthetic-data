Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Kirill's height is x centimeters. Then, his brother's height is x + 14 centimeters. We know that the sum of their heights is 112 centimeters.

So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 14) = 112.

To solve this equation, we can subtract 14 from both sides. This gives us x + x = 112 - 14. We can simplify this to x = 98.

So, Kirill is 98 centimeters tall.
