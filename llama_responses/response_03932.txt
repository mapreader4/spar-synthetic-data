Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the time it takes to vacuum each room is 20 minutes. And let's say the total time it takes to vacuum the whole house is 2 hours.

We can set up an equation to represent this information: 2 hours = 120 minutes.

Now, let's convert the 2 hours into minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes. 

Since each room takes 20 minutes to vacuum, we can divide the total time by the number of minutes it takes to vacuum each room: 120 minutes / 20 minutes = 6.

This means that there are 6 rooms in Susie's house.
