Let's break it down step by step:

Mary has 400 sheep initially.

She gave a quarter of her sheep to her sister. To find the number of sheep she gave away, we can multiply 400 by 1/4, which is the same as 100.

400 - 100 = 300

So, Mary has 300 sheep left.

She gave half of the remaining sheep to her brother. To find the number of sheep she gave away, we can multiply 300 by 1/2, which is the same as 150.

300 - 150 = 150

So, Mary gave away 150 sheep.

Now, we subtract 150 from the 300 sheep she had left, to find the number of sheep remaining with Mary:

300 - 150 = 150

Answer: 150
