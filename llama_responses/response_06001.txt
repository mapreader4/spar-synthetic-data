To find the average temperature, we need to add up all the temperatures and divide by the number of days.

Let's start by adding up the temperatures:

Sunday: 99.1
Monday: 98.2
Tuesday: 98.7
Wednesday: 99.3
Thursday: 99.8
Friday: 99
Saturday: 98.9

Total temperature: 99.1 + 98.2 + 98.7 + 99.3 + 99.8 + 99 = 594.1

There are 6 days in the week, so we divide the total temperature by 6:

594.1 รท 6 = 99

Answer: 99
