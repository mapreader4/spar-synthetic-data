To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of stars Kyle needs to buy. 

Kyle bought 2 glass bottles that can hold 15 origami stars each. That means each bottle can hold 15 stars. So, the total number of stars Kyle can hold is 2 * 15 = 30 stars.

Kyle bought 3 more identical glass bottles, so he has a total of 2 + 3 = 5 bottles. 

Since each bottle can hold 15 stars, Kyle needs 5 * 15 = 75 stars. 

Kyle has 30 stars he can hold and he needs 75 stars. So, the difference between 75 and 30 is 45. 

Kyle must buy 45 more stars. 

Answer: 45
