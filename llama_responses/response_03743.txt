Let's break this down step by step.

Calum needs to buy 4 disco balls and 10 boxes of food. Each box of food costs $25. The total cost of the food is 10 x $25 = $250.

Calum's budget for the disco balls and food is $330. So, to find out how much he can afford to spend on each disco ball, we need to subtract the cost of the food from his budget.

$330 - $250 = $80

This is the amount left over for the disco balls. Since Calum needs to buy 4 disco balls, we can divide the remaining amount by 4 to find out how much he can spend on each disco ball.

$80 รท 4 = $20

So, Calum can afford to spend $20 on each disco ball.

Answer: 20
