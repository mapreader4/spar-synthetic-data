Let's start by using the given information. The Period 1 gym class has 5 fewer students than the Period 2 gym class. Let's denote the number of students in the Period 2 gym class as x. Then, we know that the Period 1 gym class has 11 students. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

x + 5 = 11

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

x = 11 - 5
x = 6

So, the number of students in the Period 2 gym class is 6.

Answer: 6
