Let's start by letting x be the cost of one candy. Since Annie got 12 candies, and each candy costs $0.1, the cost of 12 candies is 12x. The cost of candies is 12x. 

Let's set up an equation based on this information: 12x = 12. To find the value of x, we need to divide 12 by 12. 

12 รท 12 = 1. 

So, the cost of one candy is 0.1, and the cost of 12 candies is 1.
