Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the given information:

* Nida has 50 chocolates.
* 3 boxes are filled with chocolates.
* 5 chocolates are not in a box.
* Her friend brought 25 pieces of chocolates.

Let's first find the number of chocolates in the 3 filled boxes:

3 boxes with chocolates = 3 x? = 3x? = 15 chocolates

Now, let's find the number of chocolates that are not in a box:

5 chocolates are not in a box = 5

Now, let's find the total number of chocolates:

50 chocolates in total - 15 chocolates in boxes - 5 chocolates not in a box = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, let's find the number of boxes needed to hold all the chocolates:

30 chocolates need to be placed in boxes = 30 รท 5 = 6

Answer: 6
