Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many times he needs to take the antibiotics. He needs to take it for a week, which is 7 days. He needs to take it 3 times a day, so the total number of times he needs to take it is 3 x 7 = 21.

Step 2: Determine how much each antibiotic costs. The cost of each antibiotic is $3.

Step 3: Multiply the total number of times he needs to take the antibiotic (21) by the cost of each antibiotic ($3). The result is:

Answer: 21 x $3 = $63
