Let's start by identifying the number of people wearing checkered shirts. Since 7 out of 40 people are wearing checkered shirts, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of people wearing checkered shirts.

7 = x

Now, the problem states that the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. This means that the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4x.

The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4x, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

4x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 7/4

x = 1.75

So, the answer is:
