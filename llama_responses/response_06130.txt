To solve this problem, we need to first figure out how old Heracles is right now. We know that Audrey is 7 years older than Heracles. So, let's say Heracles' current age is x. Then, in 3 years, Audrey will be 7 + 3 = 10 years older than Heracles. So, we set up an equation:

x + 3 = 7

x =?

We solve the equation by subtracting 3 from both sides:

x = 7 - 3
x = 4

So, Heracles is currently 4 years old.
