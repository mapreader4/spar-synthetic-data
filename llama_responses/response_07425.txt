Let's break this down step by step.

Lars can bake 10 loaves of bread within an hour, so she can bake 10 loaves every 60 minutes. She can bake 30 baguettes every 120 minutes, which is 2 hours. So, we need to find a common denominator between 60 and 120. The least common multiple of 60 and 120 is 120, so she can bake 5 times in an hour, 10 loaves of bread and 5 baguettes.

In 6 hours, she can bake 6 times in an hour, which is 10 loaves of bread and 6 baguettes. So, in 6 hours, Lars can bake 10 * 6 = 60 loaves and 6 * 6 = 30 baguettes. So, Lars makes 60 loaves and 30 baguettes.

Answer: 60
