Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total amount of water Madeline has in her water bottle. Since she refills her water bottle 7 times, that means she has 7 x 12 = 84 ounces of water.

Since she wants to drink 100 ounces of water, we need to find the difference between the amount she has (84 ounces) and the amount she wants (100 ounces). So, we subtract 84 from 100 to find the answer:

100 - 84 = 16.

Answer: 16
