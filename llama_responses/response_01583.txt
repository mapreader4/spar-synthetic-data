Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the cost of the new computer option:

New computer: $600, lasts 6 years, so the cost per year is $600 / 6 = $100.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the used computers:

2 used computers, each lasts 3 years, so the cost per year is $200 / 3 = $66.67.

Since the cost per year of the used computers is less than the cost per year of the new computer, James would save money by choosing the used option.

Let's calculate the total cost of the used computers over 6 years:

2 used computers, each lasts 3 years, so the total cost over 6 years is 2 * 3 * 200 = $1200.

The cost of the used option is $1200, and the cost of the new option is $600 * 6 = $3600. Therefore, James will save $360 by choosing the used option.

Answer: 360.
