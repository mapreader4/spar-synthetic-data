Let's break this down step by step.

Mom started with €55.

She bought 2 packs of bananas for €4 each. That's a total of 2 x 4 = €8.

She also bought pears for €2. That's an additional €2.

She bought asparagus for €6. That's another €6.

Finally, she bought a chicken for €11. That's €11.

In total, Mom spent €8 + €2 + €6 + €11 = €17.

So, Mom has €38 left.
