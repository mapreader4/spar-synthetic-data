Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Diane bought x apples. We know that Cecile bought 15 apples.

We know that Diane bought 20 apples. We can set up an equation to solve for x. The equation would be:

x + 15 = 20

To solve for x, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 15
x = 5

So, Diane bought 5 apples more than Cecile. Answer: 5
