To solve this problem, we will first find the calories in a pound of carrots and in a pound of broccoli, then multiply those values together.

The carrots have 51 calories per pound, and broccoli has 1/3 that many calories. So, we can set up an equation:

1 pound of carrots = 51 calories
1/3 pound of broccoli = 1/3 * 51 calories = 17 calories

Now we need to multiply the calories in a pound of carrots by 2, because Tom eats twice as much broccoli. So, we multiply 51 * 2 = 102 calories.

So, Tom ate 102 calories.
