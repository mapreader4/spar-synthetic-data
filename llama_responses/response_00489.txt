Let the price of "TOP" book be denoted as T and the price of "ABC" book be denoted as A. The difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books is given as:

T * 13 - A * 4.

The price of "TOP" book is T = 8.
The price of "ABC" book is A = 23.
The difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books is T * 13 - A * 4 = 8 * 13 - 4 * 23 = 92.

Answer: 92
