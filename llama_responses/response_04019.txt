Let's break down the cost of the tray of eggs to the cost per egg. The cost of the tray of eggs is 12 dollars, and there are 30 eggs in the tray. So, the cost per egg is 12 / 30 = 0.4 dollars.

Now, the price of an organic egg is 50 cents. So, to find the cost per egg, we need to divide the cost of the organic egg by the number of eggs in the tray. So, the cost per egg is 50 cents / 1 = 0.5 dollars.

To find out how much we can save by buying eggs in a tray instead of individually, we need to subtract the cost per egg of the tray from the cost per egg of the individual egg. So, we have 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1.
