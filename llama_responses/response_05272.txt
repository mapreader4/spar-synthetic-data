Let's start by using the information given to us. We know that Table B had twice as much money on it as Table C, which had $20 more than Table A. So, let's call the amount of money on Table A x. We know that Table B has 2x and Table C has x + 20.

We are given that there was $40 on Table A, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x + (x + 20) = 40

We can then solve for x by subtracting x + 20 from both sides:

2x = 40 - 20
2x = 20
x = 10

So, there was $10 on Table A. We can now find the total amount of money on all the tables by adding the amounts together:

Table A: $10
Table B: 2(10) = $20
Table C: 10 + 20 = $30

The total amount of money on all the tables is: $10 + $20 + $30 = $60.

Answer: 60
