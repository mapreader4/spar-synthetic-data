Let's break down the problem into smaller parts. Let's first calculate the time spent cleaning up the eggs.

The owner spends 15 seconds cleaning up each egg, and there are 60 eggs. So, the total time spent cleaning up the eggs is:

60 eggs * 15 seconds per egg = 60 * 15 = 900 seconds

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so we can convert the total time spent cleaning up the eggs from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60:

900 seconds รท 60 = 15 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time spent cleaning up the toilet paper. The owner spends 30 minutes cleaning up each roll, and there are 7 rolls. So, the total time spent cleaning up the toilet paper is:

7 rolls * 30 minutes = 7 * 30 = 210 minutes

Now, let's add the time spent cleaning up the eggs and toilet paper together:

15 minutes + 210 minutes = 225 minutes

Answer: 225
