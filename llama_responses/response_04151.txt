Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total weight of the cans Jenny can carry. Since each can weighs 2 ounces, and she can carry a total of 20 cans, the total weight of the cans is:

20 cans x 2 ounces/can = 40 ounces

Next, let's find the total weight of the bottles Jenny can carry. Since each bottle weighs 6 ounces, and she can carry as many bottles as she can carry, let's assume she can carry a total of x bottles. The total weight of the bottles is then:

x bottles x 6 ounces/bottle = 6x ounces

The total weight of the cans and bottles together is the sum of the weight of the cans and the weight of the bottles:

40 ounces (cans) + 6x ounces (bottles) = 100 ounces

Since Jenny can carry a total of 100 ounces, we can set up an equation:

40 + 6x = 100

To solve for x, we can subtract 40 from both sides:

6x = 100 - 40
6x = 60

So x = 10

Now that we know Jenny can carry 10 bottles, we can find the total money she makes. Each bottle is paid 10 cents, so:

10 bottles x 10 cents/bottle = 100 cents

Each can is paid 3 cents, and Jenny can carry 20 cans. The total money she makes from cans is:

20 cans x 3 cents/can = 60 cents

The total money Jenny makes is the sum of the money from the bottles and the money from the cans:

100 cents (bottles) + 60 cents (cans) = 160 cents

Answer: 160
