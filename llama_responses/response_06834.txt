Let's break it down step by step.

In January, Sara sent 6 letters.
In February, Sara sent 9 letters.
In March, Sara sent 3 times the number of letters she sent in January, which is 6 * 3 = 18.

To find the total number of letters Sara sent, we add the number of letters she sent in January and March together: 6 + 18 = 24.

Answer: 24
