Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of nail polishes Kim has. Kim has 12 nail polishes.

Next, we know that Heidi has 5 more nail polishes than Kim, so Heidi has 12 + 5 = 17 nail polishes.

Now, we know that Karen has 4 fewer nail polishes than Kim. Since Kim has 12, Karen has 12 - 4 = 8 nail polishes.

To find the total number of nail polishes Karen and Heidi have together, we add their individual amounts: 17 + 8 = 25.

Answer: 25
