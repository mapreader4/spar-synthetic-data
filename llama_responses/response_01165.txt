To find the total number of shingles needed, we can multiply the area of the roof by the number of shingles per square foot. 

The area of each roof is 20 feet by 40 feet, which is 800 square feet. 

The total area of the 3 roofs is 800 x 3 = 2400 square feet.

Jerry needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot, so he will need 2400 x 8 = 19200 shingles to cover the total area of the 3 roofs. 

Answer: 19200
