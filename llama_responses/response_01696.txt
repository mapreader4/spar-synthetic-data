Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total cost of the bill: $150.

Silas will pay half of the bill, so that's $150 / 2 = $75.

The remaining bill is $150 - $75 = $75.

The remaining friends will split the rest of the bill and leave a 10% tip for the whole meal. To find the amount each friend will pay, we can first find the total amount the friends will pay, which is $75.

Then, we can divide the total amount by the number of friends, which is 5 (since there are 6 friends and Silas already paid $75).

$75 / 5 = $15.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 15
