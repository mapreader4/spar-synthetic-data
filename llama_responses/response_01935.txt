Let's break down the problem step by step.

Reese had some initial amount of money in her savings account. Let's call that amount x.

In February, she spent 20% of her savings. To find the amount she spent in February, we can multiply the initial amount by 0.2 (20% as a decimal).

x * 0.2 = 0.2x

She spent 40% of her savings in March. We can find the amount she spent in March by multiplying the initial amount by 0.4 (40% as a decimal).

x * 0.4 = 0.4x

She also spent $1500 in April.

So, the total amount she spent is the sum of the amounts spent in February and March, plus the $1500 spent in April.

0.2x + 0.4x + 1500 =?

We don't know what x is yet, so let's find it. We can subtract the total amount spent from the final amount she has left, which is $2900.

2900 = 0.2x + 0.4x + 1500

To solve for x, we can subtract 1500 from both sides of the equation.

2900 - 1500 = 0.2x + 0.4x

Then, we can combine like terms.

1400 = 0.6x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.6.

x = 1400 / 0.6

x = 2333.33

So, Reese had 2333.33 initially in her savings account.
