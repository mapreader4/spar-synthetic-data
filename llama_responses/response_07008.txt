Let's break down the problem step by step.

Davonte has three square 6-foot by 6-foot paintings. This is a total of 36 square feet.

He has four small 2-foot by 3-foot paintings. This is a total of 12 square feet.

He has one large 10-foot by 15-foot painting. This is a total of 150 square feet.

So, we can add up the total square feet:

36 + 12 + 150 = 198

Answer: 198
