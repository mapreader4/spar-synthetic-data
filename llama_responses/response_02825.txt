To find the worth of the entire lot, we need to first find the value of the 1/2 share. We know that the man sold 1/10 of his share for 460 dollars, so we can find the value of the 1/2 share by multiplying the 1/10 by 10 to get 4600. Since the man owns 1/2 of the lot, we can multiply the value of the 1/2 share by 2 to get the value of the entire lot.

Answer: 9200.
