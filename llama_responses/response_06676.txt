Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's start by identifying the number of wings and the number of paintings. We know that there are 8 wings, and 4 wings are dedicated to paintings. This means that 4 wings are left for the artifacts.

We also know that the large painting takes up an entire wing. So, one wing is dedicated to this painting. This leaves 7 wings for the artifacts.

The remaining 7 wings are divided into 2 wings, each with 12 smaller paintings. This means that each wing has 6 artifacts.

To find the number of artifacts in each wing, we can divide 6 by 2 to get:
