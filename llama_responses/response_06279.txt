Let's calculate the total amount of money he made this week.

Michael sold 2 large birdhouses at 22 dollars each, so he made 2 x 22 = 44 dollars from selling the large birdhouses.

He sold 2 medium birdhouses at 16 dollars each, so he made 2 x 16 = 32 dollars from selling the medium birdhouses.

He sold 3 small birdhouses at 7 dollars each, so he made 3 x 7 = 21 dollars from selling the small birdhouses.

The total amount of money he made this week is 44 + 32 + 21 = 97 dollars.
