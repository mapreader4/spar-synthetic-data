To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the total distance Isabel runs in one day. She runs the circuit 7 times in the morning and 3 times in the afternoon. So, the total distance she runs in one day is 7 + 3 = 10 times. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the total distance she runs in one day by 7 to get the total distance she runs in a week.

Let's multiply 10 times by 7. 10 * 7 = 70. So, Isabel runs 70 meters in a week.
