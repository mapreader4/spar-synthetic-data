Let's think step by step.

Let's first find the number of dollars each piggy bank contains. There are 25 cents in a quarter, so:

Karen has 32 quarters in her piggy bank, so she has 32 * 25 = 800 cents. 800 cents is 200 dollars.

Christopher has 64 quarters in his piggy bank, so he has 64 * 25 = 1600 cents. 1600 cents is 32 dollars.

To find the difference between the amount of money Christopher has and the amount Karen has, we need to subtract the amount Karen has from the amount Christopher has. 

The difference is 1600 - 800 = 800. 

Answer: 800
