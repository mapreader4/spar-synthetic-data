Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of candles needed. Kerry wants three cakes with his age in candles on each cake. So, we need to find Kerry's age.

Let's say Kerry's age is x.

For each cake, we need x candles. Since there are three cakes, we need 3x candles in total.

The candles come in boxes of 12, and we know that each box costs $2.5. So, the total cost of the candles is 2.5x.

We know that the total cost is 5, so we can set up an equation to solve for x.

2.5x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2.5.

x = 5 / 2.5
x = 2

So, Kerry is 2 years old.
