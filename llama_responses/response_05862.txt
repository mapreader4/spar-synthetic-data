Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: First, we need to find the total miles driven by each car in a month.

For the first car, the distance driven is 450 miles / 3 cars = 150 miles per car.

For the second car, the distance driven is also 450 miles / 3 cars = 150 miles per car.

For the third car, the distance driven is also 450 miles / 3 cars = 150 miles per car.

Step 2: Now, we need to find the total amount of gas consumed by each car.

For the first car, the amount of gas consumed is 150 miles / 50 miles per gallon = 3 gallons.

For the second car, the amount of gas consumed is 150 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 15 gallons.

For the third car, the amount of gas consumed is 150 miles / 15 miles per gallon = 10 gallons.

Step 3: Now, we need to find the total cost of gas consumed by each car.

For the first car, the cost of gas is 3 gallons x $2 per gallon = $6.

For the second car, the cost of gas is 15 gallons x $2 per gallon = $30.

For the third car, the cost of gas is 10 gallons x $2 per gallon = $20.

Step 4: Finally, we need to find the total cost of gas consumed by all three cars.

The total cost of gas consumed is $6 + $30 + $20 = $56.

Answer: $56
