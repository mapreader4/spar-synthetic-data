Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. We know that there are 30 boys and the rest are girls, so there are 25 girls.
2. Three fifths of the girls have long hair. We can represent this as 3/5 * 25 = 15 girls have long hair.
3. The rest of the girls have short hair. So, the number of girls with short hair is 25 - 15 = 10.

Answer: 10
