Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Jimmy has 5 matchbooks, and each matchbook contains 24 matches. So, Jimmy has a total of:

5 matchbooks x 24 matches per matchbook = 120 matches

Since one stamp is worth 12 matches, Jimmy can trade his 120 matches for:

120 matches / 12 matches per stamp = 10 stamps

So, Jimmy trades all his matchbooks for 10 stamps. Tonya starts with 13 stamps, so after the trade, Tonya has:

13 stamps - 10 stamps = 3 stamps

Answer: 3
