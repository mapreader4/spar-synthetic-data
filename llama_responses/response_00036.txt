Let's break this problem down step by step.

Lisa earned half of the $60, so she earned 30 dollars. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so he earned 30 / 2 = 15 dollars.

Lisa earned 30 dollars, and Tommy earned 15 dollars. To find the difference between what Lisa earned and what Tommy earned, we subtract 15 from 30. 30 - 15 = 15.

Answer: 15
