Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Apollo needs new wheels for his chariot every month. That means he needs 12 wheels in a year.

Step 2: Hephaestus charges 3 golden apples for the first 6 months, which means he charges 3 * 2 = 6 golden apples for the second 6 months. So, the total number of golden apples Apollo needs to pay is 6 + 6 = 12.

Answer: 12
