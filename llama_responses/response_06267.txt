Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by finding the total time Mia had available for studying. She spent 1/5 of her day watching TV, which means she had 4/5 of her day left for other activities, including studying. She spent 1/4 of this time left on studying. So, the total time she spent studying is (1/4) of 4/5 of her day. To find this, we can multiply 1/4 by 4/5 to get the total time spent studying: (1/4) * 4/5 = 1.

So, Mia spent 1 hour studying each day.
