Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of children. We know that 7000 men and 5 times as many children as women were at the match, and we know that the total number of people is 10000. So, let's subtract 7000 from 10000 to get the number of children.

7000 - 10000 = 3000

So, there were 3000 children at the match.
