Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the total space available for the room: 400 square feet.

Jonas wants to reserve 160 square feet for a desk and some walking space, so he has 400 - 160 = 240 square feet left for bookshelves.

Each bookshelf takes up 80 square feet, so we need to know how many bookshelves can fit in the 240 square feet. 240 / 80 = 3.

So, Jonas can put 3 bookshelves in the room.
