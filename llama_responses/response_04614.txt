Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the amount in Yasmin's account before the check was deposited was x.

When she deposited the check, her new balance will be x + 50.

Since the check is a quarter of her new balance, that means that 25 is 1/4 of her new balance.

So, 4 x 25 = 100, which means that x = 100.

So, the amount in Yasmin's account before the check was deposited was 100.
