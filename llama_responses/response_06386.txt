Let's break this down step by step.

Nathan played the air hockey game 2 times. So, he played it 2 x 1 = 2 games.

Then, he played the basketball game 4 times. So, he played it 4 x 1 = 4 games.

In total, he played 2 + 4 = 6 games.

Each game costs 3 tokens. So, the total number of tokens he used is 6 x 3 = 18.

Answer: 18
