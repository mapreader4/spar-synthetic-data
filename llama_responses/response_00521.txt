Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many strawberries Micah picked.

Micah picks 2 dozen strawberries from the field. 2 dozen is equal to 24 strawberries.

Then, he eats 6 of them. So, we subtract 6 from 24 to find out how many strawberries are left.

24 - 6 = 18

So, there are 18 strawberries left for his mom.
