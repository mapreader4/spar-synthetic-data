Let's break it down step by step:

1. Tim sleeps 6 hours per day for 5 days a week. So, for 5 days, he sleeps 5 * 6 = 30 hours.
2. He sleeps 10 hours a day for the other 2 days. So, for 2 days, he sleeps 2 * 10 = 20 hours.
3. We add the hours for the 5 days and the hours for the 2 days. 30 + 20 = 50 hours.

Answer: 50
