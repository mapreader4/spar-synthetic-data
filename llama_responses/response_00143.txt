Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the total number of goldfish is x.

Since 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, that means that 25% of x are at the surface. We can write that as an equation: 0.25x = 15.

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4, since 4 times 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 0.25. So, we get:

4 * 0.25x = 4 * 15

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 15 / 4

x = 3.75

So, Toby counted 3.75 goldfish below the surface.
