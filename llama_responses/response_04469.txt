Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the cost of the English textbooks: 35 English textbooks * $7.50 = 35 x $7.50 = $262.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the geography books: 35 geography textbooks * $10.50 = 35 x $10.50 = $367.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the English and geography books together: $262.50 + $367.50 = $629.00.

So, the total cost of the order is $629.00.

Answer: 629
