Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Seymour has 4 flats of petunias, with 8 petunias per flat. To find the total number of petunias, we multiply the number of flats by the number of petunias per flat: 4 x 8 = 32 petunias.
2. Each petunia needs 8 ounces of fertilizer, so the total amount of fertilizer needed for the petunias is 32 x 8 = 256 ounces.
3. Seymour has 3 flats of roses, with 6 roses per flat. To find the total number of roses, we multiply the number of flats by the number of roses per flat: 3 x 6 = 18 roses.
4. Each rose needs 3 ounces of fertilizer, so the total amount of fertilizer needed for the roses is 18 x 3 = 54 ounces.
5. Seymour has 2 Venus flytraps. Each Venus flytrap needs 2 ounces of fertilizer, so the total amount of fertilizer needed for the Venus flytraps is 2 x 2 = 4 ounces.
6. To find the total amount of fertilizer needed in total, we add the amounts needed for the petunias, roses, and Venus flytraps: 256 + 54 + 4 = 314 ounces.

Answer: 314
