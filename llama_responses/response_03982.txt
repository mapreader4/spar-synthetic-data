Let's break it down step by step.

Angela's contribution is triple Brittany's contribution. This means that if Brittany's contribution is x, then Angela's contribution is 3x.

Brittany's contribution is triple Niraj's. This means that if Niraj's contribution is y, then Brittany's contribution is 3y.

We are told that Niraj contributed $80. So, Niraj's contribution is $80.

So, Angela's contribution is 3x, which is 3 * Niraj's contribution. Therefore, Angela's contribution is 3 * 80 = 240.

Brittany's contribution is 3y, which is 3 * Niraj's contribution. Since Niraj's contribution is $80, Brittany's contribution is 3 * 80 = 240.

To find the total contribution of Angela and Brittany, we add their individual contributions together. Angela's contribution is 240, and Brittany's contribution is also 240. So, the total amount they both contributed is 240 + 240 = 480.

Answer: 480.
