Let's break down the information given to us:

Walmart's multitool has a screwdriver and 3 knives, which is a total of 4 tools.

Target's multitool has a screwdriver, 3 x 2 = 6 knives, 3 files, and a pair of scissors, which is a total of 10 tools.

To find the difference between the number of tools, we subtract the number of tools Walmart has from the number of tools Target has:

10 (Target) - 4 (Walmart) = 6

So, Target's multitool has 6 more tools than Walmart's multitool.
