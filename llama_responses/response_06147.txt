Let's think step by step.

There are 6 dogs and 2 ducks. We need to find the total number of feet in the garden.

The dogs have 4 feet each, so 6 dogs have 6 * 4 = 24 feet. The ducks have 2 feet each, so 2 ducks have 2 * 2 = 4 feet.

To find the total number of feet in the garden, we add the number of feet of the dogs and the number of feet of the ducks:

24 + 4 = 28

So, there are 28 feet in the garden.

Answer: 28
