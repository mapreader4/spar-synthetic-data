Let's think step by step!

Barry wants a shirt that originally costs $80. The attendant gives him a 15% discount. To calculate the discounted price, I'll multiply the original price by 0.15 (15% as a decimal).

$80 * 0.15 = $12

Then, I'll subtract the discount from the original price:

$80 - $12 = $68

So, Barry is supposed to pay $68.
