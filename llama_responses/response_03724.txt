Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total amount of money Bruce got for his birthday. He got $75 from his aunt and $150 from his grandfather, so the total amount is $75 + $150 = $225.

Next, let's find one-fifth of this total amount. To find one-fifth of $225, we can divide $225 by 5. This is because one-fifth is the same as one out of five equal parts.

$225 รท 5 = $45

So, Bruce put $45 in the bank.
