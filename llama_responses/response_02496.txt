Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total value of the swag bag is $20,000.

The two diamond earrings cost $6,000, so the total value of the earrings is 2 x $6,000 = $12,000.

The new iPhone costs $2,000.

The scarves each cost $1,500, so the total value of the scarves is the number of scarves x $1,500.

Let's set up an equation: 12,000 + 2,000 + x x 1,500 = 20,000.

We can subtract 12,000 and 2,000 from both sides of the equation to get x x 1,500 = 6,000.

To find the number of scarves, we can divide 6,000 by 1,500 to get the number of scarves. 6,000 รท 1,500 = 4.
