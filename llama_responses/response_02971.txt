Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of flies Betty catches in a day. She catches 5 flies in the morning and 6 flies in the afternoon, but 1 fly escapes. So, the total number of flies she catches is 5 + 6 - 1 = 10.

Since Betty wants to gather the whole week's food for her frog, we need to multiply the daily total by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, the total number of flies Betty needs is 10 * 7 = 70.

Answer: 70
