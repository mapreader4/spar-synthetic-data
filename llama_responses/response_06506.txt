Let's break this down step by step:

1. Polly is happy for 20 minutes, so she tweets 18 times per minute. For 20 minutes, that's:

20 minutes * 18 tweets per minute = 360 tweets

2. Polly is hungry for 20 minutes, so she tweets 4 times per minute. For 20 minutes, that's:

20 minutes * 4 tweets per minute = 80 tweets

3. Polly watches her reflection for 20 minutes, so she tweets 45 times per minute. For 20 minutes, that's:

20 minutes * 45 tweets per minute = 900 tweets

To find the total number of tweets, we add up the tweets from each period:

360 (happy) + 80 (hungry) + 900 (reflection) = 1340

Answer: 1340
