Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the initial number of positive cases, which is 2000.

On the second day, the number of cases increased by 500, so the total number of cases is now 2500.

Then, on the third day, the number of new cases spiked to 1500, but the number of recoveries was 200. So, the total number of positive cases is now 2500 - 200 = 2300.

Answer: 2300
