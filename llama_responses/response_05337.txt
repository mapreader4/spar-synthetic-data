Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's say Evan earned x dollars. Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. So, Markese earned x - 5 dollars.

The total amount of money they earned together is 37 dollars. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

x - 5 + x = 37

We can add 5 to both sides of the equation to get:

x + x = 42

Now we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to find the value of x:

x = 42 - 5

x = 37

So, Markese earned 37 dollars.
