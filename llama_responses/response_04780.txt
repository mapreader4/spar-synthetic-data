Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the amount Arman received last week for his 35 hours of work:

35 hours * $10 per hour = $350

Now, this week, Arman will receive an increase of $0.5 per hour. So, his new rate per hour will be:

$10 + $0.5 = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the amount Arman will receive for his 40 hours of work this week:

40 hours * $10.5 per hour = $420

So, Arman will receive a total of $350 + $420 = $770.

Answer: 770
