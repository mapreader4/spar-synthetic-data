Let's start by identifying the cost of the chairs. Let's call the cost of each chair x. Since the three chairs cost the same amount, the total cost of the chairs is 3x. The total amount Jude paid is 130 + 50 + 20 + 20 = 220. Since Jude got a 4 dollar change, he paid 216 dollars in total. So, 216 - 4 = 212. 212 is equal to 3x. So, x = 212 / 3 = 70. 

Answer: 70
