Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Betty picked 16 strawberries, and Matthew picked 20 more than Betty, so Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries. Since Natalie picked twice as many as Betty, Natalie picked 16 x 2 = 32 strawberries. 

Next, we know that one jar of jam uses 7 strawberries. So, the total number of strawberries used for jam is 16 + 36 + 32 = 84. 

Each jar is sold for $4, so the total amount of money made from the strawberries is 84 x 4 = 336. 

Answer: 336
