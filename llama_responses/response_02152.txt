Let's start by finding the total number of people to whom the jellybeans are being distributed: 3 nephews + 2 nieces = 5 people.

To find out how many jellybeans each person gets, we can divide the total number of jellybeans (70) by the number of people (5):

70 รท 5 = 14

So each person will receive 14 jellybeans.
