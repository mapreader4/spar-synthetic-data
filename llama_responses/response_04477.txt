Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of brownies baked. Since Melanie baked 10 batches, and each batch has 20 brownies, the total number of brownies is 10 x 20 = 200.

Next, we know that 3/4 of the brownies in each batch are set aside for a bake sale. So, in each batch, 3/4 of 20 brownies are set aside, which is 3/4 * 20 = 15. Since there are 10 batches, the total number of brownies set aside is 15 * 10 = 150.

Now, we know that 3/5 of the remaining brownies are given out. The remaining brownies are the total number of brownies minus the number set aside, which is 200 - 150 = 50.

Answer: 50
