Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the total length of the streets.

There are 18 east-west streets that are 2 miles long, so the total length of the east-west streets is 18 * 2 = 36 miles. There are 10 north-south streets that are 4 miles long, so the total length of the north-south streets is 10 * 4 = 40 miles. The total length of all the streets is the sum of these two lengths, which is 36 + 40 = 76 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of cable needed.

It takes 5 miles of cable to electrify 1 mile of street. To find the total amount of cable needed, we need to multiply the total length of the streets by the amount of cable needed per mile. 76 miles * 5 = 380 miles of cable.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cable.

The cost of the cable is $2000 per mile, so the total cost is 380 * 2000 = $760,000.

Answer: 760000
