Let's break down the information given:

* The Lion King cost 10 million to make and earned 200 million at the box office.
* Star Wars earned half of what The Lion King earned, so if we let x be the amount Star Wars earned, we have the equation 200 million = x / 2.
* Star Wars cost 25 million to make, so the equation becomes 200 million = x / 2 = 25 million.
* To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 200 million * 2 = x.

Answer: 400 million.
