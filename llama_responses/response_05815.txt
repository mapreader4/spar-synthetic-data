Let's break it down step by step.

Let's let x be the original price of the car. Then, 25% of x is the amount that was discounted. So, 0.25x is the amount that was discounted.

We know that Eunice paid $7500 for the car, which is 25% less than the original price. So, we can write the equation as:

0.25x = 7500

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.25:

0.25x = 7500 / 0.25

x = 30000

So, the original price of the car was $30,000.
