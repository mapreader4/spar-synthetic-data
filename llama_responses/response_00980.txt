Let's start by identifying the number of corn cobs in each field.

The first field has 13 full rows of corn cobs, and each row contains 4 corn cobs, so the total number of corn cobs in the first field is:

13 rows x 4 corn cobs per row = 13 x 4 = 52

The second field has 16 full rows of corn cobs, and each row contains 4 corn cobs, so the total number of corn cobs in the second field is:

16 rows x 4 corn cobs per row = 16 x 4 = 64

To find the total number of corn cobs grown by the farm, we add the number of corn cobs from both fields:

52 + 64 = 116

Answer: 116
