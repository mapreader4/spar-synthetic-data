Let's break this down step by step.

Let's let x be the number of pounds of peanuts Baxter purchased.

Since the minimum is 15 pounds, we know that x must be greater than or equal to 15.

The total cost of the peanuts is $105. The cost per pound is $3. So the total cost is 3x.

We know that 3x = 105. To find x, we need to divide both sides by 3.

x = 105 / 3 = 35

So, Baxter purchased 35 pounds of peanuts.

Answer: 35
