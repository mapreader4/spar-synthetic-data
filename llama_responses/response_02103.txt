Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the area of the sandbox in square inches.
The area of a square is found by multiplying the length by the width. Since the length of each side is 40 inches, the area is:

Area = 40 x 40 = 1600 square inches.

Step 2: Determine how many square inches 80 square inches is equal to.
Since 80 square inches is 80/100 of the total area, we can set up a proportion:

Let x be the number of 30-pound bags needed. Then:

80/100 = x/30. Cross-multiply:

x = 80 x 30/100

x = 24

So, the answer is 24 bags of 30-pound sand are needed to fill the sandbox.
