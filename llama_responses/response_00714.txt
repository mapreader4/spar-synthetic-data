To find out how much John makes per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he gets per month by 30.

The total amount of money John gets per month is $0.01 per visit times 30000 visits.  This is equal to $3.00.  To find the amount per day, we divide $3.00 by 30.

$3.00 / 30 = $0.10

So, John makes $0.10 per day.
