Let's work step by step.

Let's denote Lennon's current age as L = 8.

Since Ophelia will be four times as old as Lennon in two years, we can set up an equation.

L = 4 * 2 = Ophelia's age in two years.

We know that L = 8, so we can substitute that in the equation.

4 * 2 = 8

2 = Ophelia's age in two years.

Now, we solve for Ophelia's age in two years.

Ophelia's age in two years = 2

Ophelia's age = 2 * 4 = 8

Ophelia's age = 16

Answer: 16
