Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of parrots is 8.
2. The number of snakes is 3 times the number of parrots, so the number of snakes is 3 * 8 = 24.
3. The number of monkeys is 2 times the number of snakes, so the number of monkeys is 2 * 24 = 48.
4. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, so the number of elephants is (8 + 24) / 2 = 16.
5. There are 3 fewer zebras than elephants, so the number of zebras is 16 - 3 = 13.

The difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is the difference between 48 (monkeys) and 13 (zebras). This is 48 - 13 = 35.

Answer: 35
