Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Tony bought 3 lottery tickets.
* Each ticket has 5 winning numbers.
* Each winning number is worth $20.

To find the total amount of money Tony has won, we need to multiply the number of winning tickets (3) by the value of each winning number ($20). This is because Tony has 3 tickets with 5 winning numbers on each ticket, so the total number of winning numbers is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, we can multiply the number of winning numbers (15) by the value of each winning number ($20):

15 x $20 = $300

So, Tony has won a total of $300.

Answer: 300
