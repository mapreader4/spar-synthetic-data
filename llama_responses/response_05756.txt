Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the first part of the problem: "Jacob can write twice as fast as Nathan." This means that Jacob can write twice as fast as Nathan. So, if Nathan writes x letters in one hour, Jacob can write 2x letters in one hour.

Now, let's look at the second part of the problem: "Nathan wrote 25 letters in one hour." This means that Nathan can write 25 letters in one hour. If Jacob can write 2x letters in one hour, then Jacob can write 50 letters in one hour.

So, if we multiply the two times together, we get 50 letters in one hour.
