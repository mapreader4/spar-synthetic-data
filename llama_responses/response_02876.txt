Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The total amount of the loan is $100.00 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months:

$100.00 x 12 = $1200.00

2. The one-time interest fee is 10% of the total amount, which is:

$1200.00 x 0.10 = $120.00

3. The total amount Aaron owes his dad is the total loan amount plus the interest fee:

$1200.00 + $120.00 = $1320.00

Answer: 1320
