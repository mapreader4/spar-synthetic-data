Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The number of people who showed up is 100% - 20% of 30 people, which is 0.8 * 30 = 24.
2. 75% of the 24 people who showed up get steak, so 0.75 * 24 = 18 people get steak.
3. The remaining 6 people do not get steak, so they get chicken.
4. The answer is 6.
