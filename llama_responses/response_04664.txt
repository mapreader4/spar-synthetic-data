Let's start by counting the number of slices that Phill cuts the pizza into.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, so he has 4 slices.  Then he cuts each of those 4 slices in half, so he has 8 slices.  Then he cuts each of those 8 slices in half again, so he has 16 slices.  He gives 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends, so he gives out a total of 5 slices.  This means that he has 16 - 5 = 11 slices left.  The answer is: Answer: 11
