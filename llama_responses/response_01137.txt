Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: James has 7 more Oreos than Jordan has. 4 times the number of Oreos Jordan has. And there are 52 Oreos in total.

Let's start by identifying the number of Oreos Jordan has. Let's use the information that there are 52 Oreos in total. We can write an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of Oreos Jordan has.

52 = 4x

To find the number of Oreos Jordan has, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 52 / 4

x = 13

So, Jordan has 13 Oreos.

Now, we know that James has 7 more Oreos than Jordan has. So, we can write another equation:

James has 7 + 13 =?

To solve this equation, we can add 7 and 13:

James has 20 Oreos.

Answer: 20
