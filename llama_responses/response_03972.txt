Let's start by calculating the number of calories from the strawberries. Since strawberries have 4 calories each, and Zoe ate 12 strawberries, the number of calories from the strawberries is 12 x 4 = 48.

Next, let's calculate the number of calories from the yogurt. Zoe ate 6 ounces of yogurt, and yogurt has 17 calories per ounce, so the number of calories from the yogurt is 6 x 17 = 102.

To get the total number of calories, we add the calories from the strawberries and the yogurt, 48 + 102 = 150.

Answer: 150
