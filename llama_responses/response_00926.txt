Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The cost of the guest bathroom towels is 2 x $40.00 = $80.00.
2. The cost of the master bathroom towels is 4 x $50.00 = $200.00.
3. The total cost of the towels before the discount is $80.00 + $200.00 = $280.00.
4. The store is offering a 20% discount on the total cost. To find the discount, multiply the total cost by 0.20 = $280.00 x 0.20 = $56.00.
5. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost: $280.00 - $56.00 = $224.00.
