Let's break this down step by step.

1. Max has 342 coconuts. He wants to convert all of them into goats. He can trade 3 coconuts for a crab and 6 crabs for a goat. So, we can assume that the ratio of coconuts to goats is 3:1.

2. If the ratio is 3:1, then for every 3 coconuts, Max can get 1 goat. So, to convert 342 coconuts into goats, we can divide 342 by 3. 342 divided by 3 is 114.

3. So, Max will have 114 goats.

Answer: 114
