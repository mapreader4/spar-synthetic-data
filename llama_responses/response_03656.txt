Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of pencils the hand-crank sharpener can sharpen in six minutes. 

A hand-crank pencil sharpener can sharpen one pencil every 45 seconds. So, in 6 minutes, it can sharpen:

6 minutes = 6 x 60 seconds = 360 seconds

Now, let's find the number of pencils the electric sharpener can sharpen in the same time.

An electric pencil sharpener can sharpen one pencil in 20 seconds. So, to sharpen 360 pencils, it would take:

360 seconds / 20 seconds = 18 pencils

So, the electric sharpener can sharpen 18 pencils in the same 6 minutes. 

Now, we can compare the number of pencils the electric sharpener can sharpen to the number of pencils the hand-crank sharpener can sharpen.

The hand-crank sharpener can sharpen 1 pencil every 45 seconds. So, in 6 minutes, it can sharpen:

6 minutes / 45 seconds = 8 pencils

So, the electric sharpener can sharpen 18 pencils in 6 minutes, while the hand-crank sharpener can sharpen 8 pencils in the same time.

The electric sharpener can sharpen more pencils than the hand-crank sharpener.
