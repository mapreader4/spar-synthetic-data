Let's break this down step by step.

1. Each worker produces 4 chairs per hour.
2. There are 3 workers, so the total number of chairs produced per hour is 3 x 4 = 12 chairs.
3. In 6 hours, they produce an additional chair.
4. So, the total number of chairs produced in 6 hours is 12 * 6 = 72 chairs.
5. So, the answer is: Answer: 72.
