Let's break this down step by step.

Maria gave her friend Isha a third of her money. So, let's say Maria has M dollars. Then, half of what she gave to Florence is M / 3. Florence received three times as much money as Maria's cousin Rene. So, Rene received 3 * (M / 3). We know that Rene received $300, so we can set up an equation: 3 * (M / 3) = 300. To solve for M, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get M = 300 / 3. M = 100. So, Maria gave her three friends a total of $100.
