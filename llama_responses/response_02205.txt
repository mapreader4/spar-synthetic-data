Let's break it down step by step.

Frank picked 36 apples. Susan picked 3 times as many apples as Frank, so she picked 36 / 3 = 12 apples.

Susan gave out half of her apples, so she gave out 12 / 2 = 6 apples.

Frank sold a third of his apples, so he sold 36 / 3 = 12 apples.

Now let's add the apples they have left together. Frank has 36 - 12 = 24 apples left. Susan has 12 - 6 = 6 apples left.

In total, Frank and Susan have 24 + 6 = 30 apples left.
