Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Max fills up water balloons for 30 minutes at a rate of 2 water balloons every minute. This means that in 30 minutes, Max will fill up 2 x 30 = 60 water balloons.

Step 2: Max's friend Zach fills up water balloons for 40 minutes at a rate of 3 water balloons every minute. This means that in 40 minutes, Zach will fill up 3 x 40 = 120 water balloons.

Step 3: 10 of the water balloons pop on the ground. So, we need to subtract 10 from the total number of water balloons filled by Max and Zach.

Step 4: To find the total number of water balloons filled by Max and Zach, we add the number of water balloons filled by Max and Zach: 60 + 120 = 180. Then, we subtract 10 from this total: 180 - 10 = 170.

Answer: 170
