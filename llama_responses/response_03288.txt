Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Flynn watches 30 minutes of TV every night during the weekdays. That is a total of 30 * 5 = 150 minutes during the weekdays.
2. On the weekends, she watches an additional 2 hours of TV in total. 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes.
3. To find the total number of minutes of TV she watches in a week, we need to add the minutes watched during the weekdays and the minutes watched on the weekends. 150 + 120 = 270 minutes.
4. There are 7 days in a week. To find the total number of minutes of TV Flynn watches in a week, we need to multiply the total minutes by 7. 270 * 7 = 1890 minutes.

Answer: 1890
