Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that Mr. Llesis had 50 kilograms of rice. We also know that he kept 7/10 of it in storage. To find out how many kilograms of rice Mr. Llesis kept, we need to multiply 7/10 with 50.

7/10 is the same as 0.7, so we can multiply 50 * 0.7 to get the answer.

50 * 0.7 = 35

So, Mr. Llesis kept 35 kilograms of rice.
