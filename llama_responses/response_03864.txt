Let's break it down step by step:

Neil baked 20 cookies. He gave 2/5 of the cookies to his friend.

To find the number of cookies Neil gave to his friend, we need to find 2/5 of the total 20 cookies. To do this, we can multiply 2 by 20 and then divide by 5.

2/5 = 40/5 = 8

So Neil gave 8 cookies to his friend.

Neil has 20 - 8 cookies left.

20 - 8 = 12

Answer: 12
