Let's start by identifying the number of students who did not pass their exams. The total number of students is 804, and the number of students who passed is 0.75 * 804 = 603. To find the number of students who did not pass their exams, we subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students. So, the number of students who did not pass their exams is 804 - 603 = 201.

Answer: 201
