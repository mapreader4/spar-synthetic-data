Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of the toilet paper. Since Amber buys 10 rolls of toilet paper, the cost will be 10 x 1.50 = 15 dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of the paper towels. Amber buys 7 rolls of paper towels, and each roll costs 2 dollars. So, the total cost of the paper towels is 7 x 2 = 14 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the toilet paper and the paper towels to find the total cost of all the items.

The total cost is 15 + 14 = 29 dollars. But the total cost is given as 35 dollars, so we need to find the cost of the tissues.

Let's subtract 29 from 35 to find the cost of the tissues.

35 - 29 = 6
