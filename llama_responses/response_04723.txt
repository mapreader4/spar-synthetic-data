Let's break this down step by step.

First, Cary walks 3 miles round-trip to the grocery store. Since it's round-trip, that means he walks 6 miles in total.

Next, Cary eats a candy bar with 200 calories. This is the total number of calories he consumes.

Now, Cary burns 150 calories per mile walked. Since he walked 6 miles, he burns 6 x 150 = 900 calories.

To find his net calorie deficit, we need to subtract the calories he burned from the total calories he consumed. That is, 200 - 900 = -700.

Answer: -700
