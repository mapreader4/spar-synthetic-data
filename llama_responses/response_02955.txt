Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of students that Mo will give Valentine's cards to. 60% of 30 is 0.6 x 30 = 18.

Step 2: Find the cost of the Valentine's cards. 18 cards cost $2 each, so the total cost is 18 x $2 = $36.

Step 3: Find the percentage of his money that Mo will spend on Valentine's cards. $36 is the cost of the cards, and he has $40, so we need to find what percentage of $40 is $36.

Step 4: To find the percentage, we can divide the cost by the total amount: $36 รท $40 = 0.9.

Answer: 0.9 or 90%.
