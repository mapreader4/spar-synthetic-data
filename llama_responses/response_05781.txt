Let's break down the cost of each item Candice buys:

* 2 loaves of white bread: 2 x $3.50 = $7.00
* 1 baguette: $1.50
* 2 loaves of sourdough bread: 2 x $4.50 = $9.00
* 1 almond croissant: $2.00

Total cost per visit: $7.00 + $1.50 + $9.00 + $2.00 = $19.50

Since Candice visits the bakery 4 times a week, she will spend a total of:

$19.50 x 4 = $78.00

per week.

To find the total amount she spends over 4 weeks, I multiply the weekly amount by 4:

$78.00 x 4 = $312.00

Answer: 312
