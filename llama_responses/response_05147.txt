Let's break it down step by step.

1. Rachel makes $12.00 as a waitress in a coffee shop.
2. In one hour, she serves 20 different people.
3. They all leave her a $1.25 tip.
4. To find out how much money she made in that hour, we need to multiply the number of people she served by the tip they left her.

So, 20 people left her $1.25 each, so the total amount of money they left her is:

20 x $1.25 = $25.00

5. To find out how much money she made in that hour, we need to add the $12.00 she made as her salary to the $25.00 the people left her.

$12.00 + $25.00 = $37.00

So, Rachel made a total of $37.00 in that hour.
