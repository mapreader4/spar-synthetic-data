Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how big Canada is in relation to the United States. We know that Canada is 1.5 times bigger than the United States, so we can write this as an equation: Canada = 1.5 * United States.

Next, we need to find how big Russia is in relation to Canada. We know that Russia is 1/3 bigger than Canada. We can write this as an equation: Russia = 1/3 * Canada.

Now we need to find how big Russia is in relation to the United States. We can do this by using the information we have so far. We know that Russia is 1/3 bigger than Canada and Canada is 1.5 times bigger than the United States. So, we can say that Russia is (1/3 * 1.5) times bigger than the United States.

To simplify this, we can multiply 1/3 and 1.5 together to get 0.5. So, Russia is 0.5 times bigger than the United States.

Answer: 0.5
