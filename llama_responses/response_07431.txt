Let's start by calculating the total weight of the fish they caught: 8 pounds (trout) + 6 pounds (bass) + 24 pounds (salmon) = 38 pounds.

Since each person will eat 2 pounds of fish, we can divide the total weight of fish by 2: 38 pounds / 2 = 19.

So, Patricia and Geoffrey can feed 19 campers.
