Let's start by identifying the unit of measurement of the weight of the oranges. Since the problem states that the 12 bags of oranges weigh 24 pounds, we can conclude that 1 bag of oranges weighs 24/12 = 2 pounds.

Now, if we want to find the weight of 8 bags, we can multiply the weight of 1 bag by 8, which gives us:

2 pounds * 8 = 16 pounds

So, the 8 bags weigh 16 pounds.
