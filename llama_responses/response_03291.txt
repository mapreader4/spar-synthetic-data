Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that everyone has promised to contribute $400, and Rick has actually received $285. This means that the total amount of money that Rick is still waiting to receive is:

$400 (promised) - $285 (received) = $115

This is the total amount of money that Sally, Amy, Derek, and Carl still owe.

Next, we know that Sally and Carl both owe equal amounts. Let's call this amount "x". Then, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Sally's contribution + Carl's contribution = x

We also know that Amy owes $30, and Derek owes half as much as Amy, which is:

Derek's contribution = Amy's contribution / 2
= $30 / 2
= $15

So, the total amount of money that Sally, Amy, Derek, and Carl still owe can be represented as:

Sally's contribution + Carl's contribution + Amy's contribution + Derek's contribution = x + x + $30 + $15
= 2x + $45

We know that the total amount of money they still owe is $115, so we can set up an equation:

2x + $45 = $115

Subtracting $45 from both sides gives us:

2x = $70

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = $35

So, Sally and Carl each owe $35.

Answer: 35
