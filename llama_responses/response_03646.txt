Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the total number of items Barney's grocery store ordered initially. They ordered 4458 items. Then, they sold 1561 items. To find the total number of items in the store, we need to subtract the number of items sold from the total items ordered.

4458 (initial items) - 1561 (items sold) = 2897 items

Then, we need to subtract the number of items in the storeroom. They have 575 items in the storeroom. So, we subtract this from the total items left:

2897 (items left) - 575 (items in storeroom) = 2322

Answer: 2322
