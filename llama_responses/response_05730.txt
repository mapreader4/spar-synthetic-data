To find the current balance, we need to find the amount of interest that was added to the initial balance. The initial balance is $50.00. The 20% interest fee is 0.2 x 50 = $10.00. Then, the interest fee is added to the balance, making it $60.00. The next month, he adds $20.00, so the new balance is $80.00. Then, the 20% interest fee is added again, making the new balance $80.00 + 0.2 x 80 = $16.00. The current balance is $96.00.
