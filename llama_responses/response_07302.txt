Let's break down the problem step by step:

The room is 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. The area of the room is the area of a rectangle, which is the product of the length and width, so it is 20 x 20 x 8 = 320 square feet.

The wall with the 3-foot by 7-foot doorway has an area of 3 x 7 = 21 square feet.

The wall with the 6-foot by 4-foot window has an area of 6 x 4 = 24 square feet.

The wall with the 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to the walk-in-closet has an area of 5 x 7 = 35 square feet.

The fourth wall is completely solid, so it has an area of 20 x 8 = 160 square feet.

To find the total area of the wall space that Linda will have to paint, we need to add up the areas of all the walls. So, the total area is:

21 + 24 + 35 + 160 = 220 square feet.

Answer: 220
