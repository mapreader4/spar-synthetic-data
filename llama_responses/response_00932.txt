Let's break down the problem step by step:

Maia gets 6 client requests every day, and she works on 4 of them each day. So, in a single day, she completes 4 requests.

To find out how many requests she will have remaining after 5 days, we need to multiply the number of requests she completes in a day (4) by the number of days (5):

4 requests per day x 5 days = 20 requests

So, Maia will have 20 requests remaining to work on after 5 days.

Answer: 20
