Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the number of dolphins in the ocean initially: 65 dolphins.

Then, three times that number joins in from a river which has its mouth at the ocean. This means that 3 x 65 dolphins join the 65 dolphins already present in the ocean. 

To find the total number of dolphins in the ocean, we multiply the number of dolphins joining from the river by 3 with the initial number of dolphins: 65 + 3 x 65 = 65 + 195 = 260.

Answer: 260
