Let's work step by step.

Let's start by identifying the age of Milena's grandmother. We know that Milena is 7 years old, and her grandmother is 9 years older than her. So, her grandmother is 7 + 9 = 16 years old.

Milena's grandfather is 2 years older than her grandmother, so he is 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Now, we need to find the age difference between Milena and her grandfather. The difference is 14.
