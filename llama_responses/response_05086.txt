Let's break this down step by step.

First, the normal cost of the ticket and food combo would be:

Ticket: $10
Food combo: $10
Total: $20

Now, let's calculate the discount on the ticket:

20% off on the ticket would be:
$10 * 0.20 = $2
So, the discount on the ticket would be $2.

And, let's calculate the discount on the food combo:

50% off on the food combo would be:
$10 * 0.50 = $5
So, the discount on the food combo would be $5.

Now, let's add the discounts:

Discount on ticket: $2
Discount on food combo: $5
Total discount: $2 + $5 = $7

The total discount Trip could get would be $7.

So, the final cost would be:
$20 (original cost) - $7 (discount) = $13
