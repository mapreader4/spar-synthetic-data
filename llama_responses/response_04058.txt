Let's start by letting x be the age of Tom's dog. We know that Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog, so Tom's brother is 4x. Since Tom's brother will be 30 years old in 6 years, we can set up the equation 4x + 6 = 30. We can solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 24. Then, we can divide both sides by 4 to find that x is 6. Therefore, in 6 years, Tom's dog will be 6 years old.
