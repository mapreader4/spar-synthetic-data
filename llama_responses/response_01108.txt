Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that Heike has some number of cards. Let's call this number x.

We know that Anton has three times as many cards as Heike does, so Anton has 3x cards.

We know that Ann has six times as many cards as Heike does, so Ann has 6x cards.

We also know that Ann has 60 cards. We can set up an equation to represent the information given:

3x + 6x = 60

We can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get:

6x = 60 - 3x

We can subtract 3x from both sides to get:

x = 20

So, we know that x is 20. We can multiply 20 by 3 to find the number of cards Anton has more than Anton has:

20 * 3 = 60

Anton has 60 cards. Ann has 60 cards, which is the same number. Therefore, Ann has the same number of cards as Anton.
