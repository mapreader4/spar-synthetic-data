Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Jason had some initial amount of money. Let's call it x.

After spending 1/4 of his money on some books, he spent 1/4 of x, so he was left with 3/4 of his money.

Then, he spent 2/5 of the remaining money on some DVDs. This means he spent 2/5 of 3/4 of his money, which is 6/20 of his money.

He spent an additional $8 on some DVDs, so we add that to the 6/20 of his money he spent, which is 8/20 of his money.

So, he spent 8/20 of his money, which is 2/5 of his money.

He was left with $130. So, to find the initial amount of money Jason had, we can set up an equation:

3/4x - 8/20x = 130

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 20:

3x - 16x = 2600

Add 16x to both sides to get:

3x = 1316

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 437

Answer: 437
