Let's break it down step by step.

There are 4 trains, each with 4 carriages. So, there are 4 * 4 = 16 carriages.

Each carriage has 3 rows of wheels. So, each carriage has 3 * 5 = 15 wheels.

To find the total number of wheels, we multiply the number of carriages by the number of wheels per carriage: 16 * 15 = 240 wheels.

Answer: 240
