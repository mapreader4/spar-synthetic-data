Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what Nancy buys.

Nancy buys one set of crystal beads, which costs $9.
She also buys two sets of metal beads, which costs 2 x $10 = $20.

So, to find out how much Nancy spends in all, we need to add the cost of the crystal beads and the cost of the metal beads.

The cost of the crystal beads is $9, and the cost of the metal beads is $20, so the total cost is $9 + $20 = $29.

Answer: 29
