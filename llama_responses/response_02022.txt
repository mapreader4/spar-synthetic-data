To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days that the 2-liter bottle of soda will last.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The 2-liter bottle of soda contains 1000 ml of soda.
2. Dana drinks 500 ml of soda each day.
3. To find out how many days the 2-liter bottle will last, we need to divide the total amount of soda in the bottle (1000 ml) by the amount Dana drinks each day (500 ml).

1000 ml (total soda in the bottle) รท 500 ml (amount Dana drinks each day) = 2 days
