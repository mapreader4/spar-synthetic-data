Let's start by finding the area of the largest room, which is 45 feet wide and 30 feet long. The area of the largest room is 45 x 30 = 1350 square feet.

Next, let's find the area of the smallest room, which is 15 feet wide and 8 feet long. The area of the smallest room is 15 x 8 = 120 square feet.

The difference between the largest room and the smallest room is 1350 - 120 = 1230 square feet.
