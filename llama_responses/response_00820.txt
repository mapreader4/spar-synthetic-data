Let's break this problem down step by step.

James orders a $16 meal, his friend orders a $14 meal, and together they pay the total bill. James pays his half of the bill and the tip. So the bill is $16 + $14 = $30. James pays half of that, which is $15. Then he pays 20% of the bill as a tip, which is $6. So James paid a total of $15 + $6 = $21.
