Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Howard has a collection of 70 wooden bowls initially.
2. He rewards two bowls for every 10 customers, so for every 10 customers, he gives away 2 bowls. This means that for every 10 customers, he gives away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 bowls.
3. There are 20 customers in total, and half of them bought 20 bowls each. So, half of 20 is 10, so 10 customers bought 20 bowls each.
4. The other half of the customers didn't buy any bowls, so they didn't receive any rewards.
5. For the 10 customers who bought 20 bowls each, Howard gave away a total of 10 x 2 = 20 bowls.
6. This leaves the original 70 bowls minus the 20 bowls given away, which is 70 - 20 = 50 bowls remaining.

Answer: 50
