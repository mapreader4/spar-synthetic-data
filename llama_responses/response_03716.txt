Let's break this problem down step by step.

John starts at an elevation of 400 feet.  He travels downward at a rate of 10 feet per minute for 5 minutes.  That means he travels 5 * 10 = 50 feet in 1 minute.  In 5 minutes, he will travel 5 * 50 = 250 feet.  Since he is traveling downward, his new elevation is 400 - 250 = 150 feet.

Answer: 150
