Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kim drinks a 1.5-quart bottle of water. 1 quart is equal to 32 ounces. So, she drinks 32 ounces of water.

Then, she drinks a 12 ounce can of water. So, she drinks 12 ounces of water.

To find the total amount of water she drank, we need to add the 32 ounces she drank from the 1.5-quart bottle to the 12 ounces she drank from the can. We can add the two amounts together:

32 ounces (from the 1.5-quart bottle) + 12 ounces (from the can) = 44 ounces

Answer: 44
