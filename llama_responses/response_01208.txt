Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the age of the hyena. Since the lioness is twice the age of the hyena, and the lioness is 12 years old, the age of the hyena is 12 / 2 = 6.

Now, let's find the age of the babies. Since the babies are half the age of their mothers, and the lioness is 12 years old, the babies are 12 / 2 = 6 years old.

In 5 years, the babies will be 6 + 5 = 11 years old.

So, the sum of the age of the babies in 5 years is 11.
