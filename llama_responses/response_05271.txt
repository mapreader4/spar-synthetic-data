Let's break it down step by step.

The duck takes 40 days to fly to the south during winter.

It takes twice as much time to fly to the north during summer, so that would be 2 x 40 = 80 days.

The duck takes 60 days to travel to the East during spring.

So, the total number of days the duck flies during these seasons is:

40 + 80 + 60 = 180

Answer: 180
