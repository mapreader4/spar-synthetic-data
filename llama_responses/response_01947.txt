Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: We know that Caleb has 3 dozen jellybeans. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 x 12 = 36. So Caleb has 36 jellybeans.

Step 2: We know that Sophie has half as many jellybeans as Caleb. So Sophie has 1/2 x 36 = 1/2 x 36 = 18 jellybeans.

Step 3: We add the number of jellybeans that Caleb has with the number of jellybeans Sophie has. So the total number of jellybeans is 36 + 18 = 54.

Answer: 54
