Let's break down the cost of the wasted food first. 

20 pounds of meat at $5/pound is 20 x $5 = $100. 
15 pounds of fruits and vegetables at $4/pound is 15 x $4 = $60. 
60 pounds of bread products at $1.50/pound is 60 x $1.50 = $90. 

The total cost of the wasted food is $100 + $60 + $90 = $250. 

James also has to pay for 10 hours of time-and-a-half pay for the janitorial staff. The janitorial staff normally make $10/hour, so time-and-a-half pay would be 1.5 x $10 = $15/hour. For 10 hours, that would be 10 x $15 = $150. 

The total amount James has to pay is $250 (wasted food) + $150 (janitorial staff) = $400. 

James has to work at minimum wage ($8/hour) to pay for everything. To find out how many hours he has to work, we can divide the total amount he has to pay by his hourly wage: 

$400 / $8 = 50 hours. 

Answer: 50
