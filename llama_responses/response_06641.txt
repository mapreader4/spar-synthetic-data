Let's break this down step by step:

1. The spider weighs 2.5 times the previous largest spider, which weighed 6.4 ounces. So the spider weighs 2.5 * 6.4 = 16 ounces.

2. The area of each leg is 0.5 square inches. The pressure is the weight of the spider divided by the area of the leg. So, the pressure in ounces per square inch is the weight in ounces divided by the area in square inches.

3. The weight of the spider is 16 ounces. The area of each leg is 0.5 square inches. So, the pressure is 16 ounces / 0.5 square inches = 32 ounces per square inch.

Answer: 32
