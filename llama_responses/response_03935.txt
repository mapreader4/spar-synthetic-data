Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to calculate how many pets are adopted each month. For dogs, 50% are adopted, which is 30 x 0.5 = 15 dogs. For cats, 25% are adopted, which is 28 x 0.25 = 7 cats. For lizards, 20% are adopted, which is 20 x 0.2 = 4 lizards.

So, in total, 15 + 7 + 4 = 26 pets are adopted each month.

Now, we need to add the 13 new pets that the shelter takes in each month. So, we add 13 to the total number of pets that are adopted, which is 26 + 13 = 39.

Finally, we need to add the original number of pets at the shelter. There were 30 dogs, 28 cats, and 20 lizards. So, the total number of pets is 30 + 28 + 20 = 78.

After one month, there are 78 pets at the shelter.
