Let's break it down step by step.

Annie walked 5 blocks from her house to the bus stop. So, that's 5 blocks.
Then, she rode the bus 7 blocks to the coffee shop. So, that's 7 blocks.
Then, she came home the same way, so she walked 5 blocks back to her house. So, that's another 5 blocks.

To find the total number of blocks she traveled, we add the number of blocks she walked (5 + 5) and the number of blocks she rode the bus (7). So, the total number of blocks Annie traveled is:

5 + 7 + 5 = 17

Answer: 17
