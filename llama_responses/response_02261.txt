Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Greg has x gold. We know that Katie has 4x more gold than Greg, so Katie has 4x + x gold.

The total amount of gold is 100, so the equation is:

x + 4x = 100

We can solve for x by subtracting 4x from both sides of the equation, like so:

x = 100 - 4x

This gives us:

x = 100 - 4x / 4

x = 25

So Greg has 25 gold.
