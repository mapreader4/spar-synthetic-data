To solve this problem, I will count the number of insects that are still in the playground.

There are 3 spiders, which are already present.
There are 12 ants climbing the wall, so I will add 12 to the total number of insects.
Ming finds 8 ladybugs, but 2 of them fly away, so I will subtract 2 from the total number of ladybugs. That leaves 6 ladybugs.
Adding all the insects together, I get:

3 (spiders) + 12 (ants) + 6 (ladybugs) = 21

So, the answer is: Answer: 21
