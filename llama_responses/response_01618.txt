Let's break this down step by step.

James took the offer, which means the second pair of shoes is half off the original price. The original price of the second pair is $60, so half of that is $30. This means the second pair of shoes actually costs $30, not $60.

The first pair of shoes costs $40. Since the offer only applies to the cheaper pair, James doesn't get half off the price of the first pair. He still pays $40 for the first pair.

The total amount James needs to pay is the price of the first pair plus the price of the second pair, which is $40 + $30 = $70.

However, James was also selected for an extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. To find a fourth of the total amount, we divide $70 by 4, which gives us $17.50. This means James gets a discount of $17.50.

To find the final amount James pays, we subtract the discount from the total amount: $70 - $17.50 = $52.50.
