Let's break it down step by step:

1. Joe caught the ball 23 times.
2. Derek made 4 less than double the catches Joe did, so Derek caught the ball 2 * 23 - 4 = 42 times.
3. Tammy caught the ball 16 more than a third of the times Derek did, so Tammy caught the ball (42 + 16) / 3 = 20 times.

So, Tammy caught the ball 20 times.

Answer: 20
