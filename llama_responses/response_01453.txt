To solve this problem, I will first convert the weight of the chocolate from kilograms to grams. There are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram. Therefore, the weight of the chocolate is 2000 grams.

Since a chocolate bar weighs 125 grams, we can divide the total weight of the chocolate by the weight of a single bar to find the number of bars. 

2000 g / 125 g = 16 bars.

Answer: 16
