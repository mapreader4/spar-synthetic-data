Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that Maggie was allowed to catch half of the total number of goldfish she saw. The total number of goldfish she saw was 100. To find the half of the total number of goldfish, we can divide 100 by 2. 100 / 2 is 50. So, Maggie was allowed to take 50 goldfish. She caught 3/5 of the 50 goldfish she was allowed to take home. To find the fraction 3/5, we can multiply 50 by 3. 50 * 3 = 150. So, Maggie caught 150 goldfish. To find the total number of goldfish she has to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home, we subtract 150 from 50. 50 - 150 = 50. So, Maggie has 50 goldfish remaining to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home.
