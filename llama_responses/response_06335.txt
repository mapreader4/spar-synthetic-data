Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of cucumbers is x.

The problem states that there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers. So, if there are x cucumbers, then there will be 3x tomatoes.

The total number of vegetables used is 280. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 3x = 280

We can solve for x by subtracting 3x from both sides:

x + 3x - 3x = 280 - 3x

This simplifies to:

x = 280 / 2

x = 140

So, the number of cucumbers used in the salad is 140.

Answer: 140
