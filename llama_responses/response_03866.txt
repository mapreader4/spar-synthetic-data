Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of bikes the shop owner had at the beginning of the month is x.

At the end of the month, the shop owner had 45 bikes in stock. After selling 18 bikes, she had 45 - 18 = 27 bikes left.

Since she adds 3 bikes every week, we can say that the number of bikes she had at the beginning of the month is x - 4 * 4 = x - 16.

So, x - 16 = 45. Solving for x, we get x = 61.

Answer: 61.
