Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jimmy stays in a hostel for the first 3 days, and the cost is $15 per night. So, the total cost for the hostel is:

15 * 3 = 45

For the next 2 days, Jimmy stays in a cabin with 2 friends, and the cost is $45 total per night. Since they are sharing the cost, we need to divide it by 3 to get the individual cost. So, the individual cost for each person is:

45 / 3 = 15

Since Jimmy is one of the people, his cost is:

15

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost for the hostel and the cabin:

45 + 15 = 60

Answer: 60
