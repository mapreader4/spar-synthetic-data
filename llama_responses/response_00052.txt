Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that Arnel had ten boxes of pencils, and each box has the same number of pencils. This means that the total number of pencils is the same for each box. 

Now, we know that Arnel kept ten pencils for himself and shared the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. This means that the number of pencils he shared is the total number of pencils minus the number of pencils he kept for himself. 

The total number of pencils is 10, and the number of pencils he kept is 10. The number of pencils he shared is 10 - 10 = 0. This means that he shared 0 pencils with his friends.

Now, since he shared the remaining pencils equally with his five friends, the number of pencils each friend got is 0 รท 5 = 0. This means that each friend got 0 pencils.

The number of pencils in each box is the same, and the number of pencils in each box is 0. So, the answer is:

Answer: 0
