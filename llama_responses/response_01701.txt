Let's break this down step by step.

First, Sandra has a box of apples that weighs 120 pounds. She's going to use half of it to make applesauce, so we need to find half of 120.

To find half of 120, we can divide 120 by 2:

120 รท 2 = 60

So, Sandra will use 60 pounds of apples to make applesauce.

Now, the remaining weight of apples is 120 - 60 = 60 pounds.

She needs 4 pounds of apples per pie, so to find the number of pies she can make, we can divide the remaining 60 pounds by 4:

60 รท 4 = 15

Answer: 15
