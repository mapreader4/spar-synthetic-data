Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find out how much Burt spent in total on the packet of basil seeds and the potting soil.

$2.00 on the packet of basil seeds + $8.00 on potting soil = $10.00

Next, let's find out how many basil plants he got from the packet of seeds.

20 basil plants

Now, let's find out how much money he made from selling each basil plant.

$5.00 per plant

Now, let's find out his total revenue from selling all the basil plants.

20 plants x $5.00 per plant = $100.00

Now, let's find out his net profit.

$100.00 (revenue) - $10.00 (cost) = $90.00

Answer: 90
