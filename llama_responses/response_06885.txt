Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Farrah ordered 4 boxes.
Step 2: Each box contains 20 matchboxes.
Step 3: Each matchbox contains 300 sticks.

Step 4: To find the total number of match sticks, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of matchboxes per box and the number of sticks per matchbox.

Number of matchsticks = 4 boxes * 20 matchboxes per box * 300 sticks per matchbox
= 4 * 20 * 300
= 24000

Answer: 24000
