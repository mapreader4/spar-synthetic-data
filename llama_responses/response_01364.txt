Let's start by calculating the cost of the textbooks. Gina has 5 textbooks that cost $120 each, so that's a total of 5 x 120 = $600. Then, she has to pay a $200 facilities fee, so that's an additional $200. Then she has to take 14 credits, which cost $450 each, so that's a total of 14 x 450 = $6300. So, to find the total amount Gina will spend, we add the cost of the textbooks, the facilities fee, and the cost of the credits together: 600 + 200 + 6300 = $6800. Gina will spend a total of $6800.
