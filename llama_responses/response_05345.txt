Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Lee earns $60,000 per year, which is $5,000 per month.
2. He wants to save $1000 per month, which means he can save $20,000 per year.
3. Lee wants to spend two months' salary on the ring, which is $10,000.
4. Since Lee earns $5,000 per month, he needs 2 months to save $10,000.

To find the number of months it will take Lee to save $10,000, we can divide $10,000 by $5,000:

$10,000 รท $5,000 = 2

So, Lee will need 2 months to save $10,000.

Answer: 2
