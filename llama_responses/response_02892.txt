Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the speed John was traveling. We know that distance = 150 miles and time = 2 hours. To find the speed, we can use the formula speed = distance / time. We can plug in the given values:

speed = distance / time
speed = 150 / 2
speed = 75

John was driving at 75 mph.

To find how many miles per hour above the speed limit he was driving, we need to subtract the speed limit from his actual speed:

speed above speed limit = speed - speed limit
speed above speed limit = 75 - 60
speed above speed limit = 15

John was driving 15 miles per hour above the speed limit.
