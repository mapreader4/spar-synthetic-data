Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the new height of Devin after he grows 3 inches. If he is 65 inches tall and grows 3 inches, then his new height is:

65 + 3 = 68 inches

Since the team's height requirement is 66 inches, and Devin's new height is 68 inches, we can see that he is 2 inches above the required height.

To make the team, he needs to lose 2 inches. If he loses 10% of his height for every additional inch of height, then we can calculate the number of inches he needs to lose as follows:

Let's first convert the required height of 66 inches to a decimal: 66 รท 10 = 6.6

Since Devin needs to lose 2 inches, we can divide 2 by 6.6 to find out how many times he needs to lose 10% of his height:

2 รท 6.6 = 0.3

So, Devin needs to lose 0.3 inches for every 10% of his height. Since he is 68 inches tall, he needs to lose 0.3 x 68 inches = 20.4 inches.

Since he is already 2 inches above the required height, he only needs to lose 20.4 - 2 = 18.4 inches to make the team.

So, the answer is: Answer: 18.4
