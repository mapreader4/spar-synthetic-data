Let's break this down step by step.

Let's find out how many cups of water each sibling drinks in a day.

Theo drinks 8 cups of water every day.
Mason drinks 7 cups of water every day.
Roxy drinks 9 cups of water every day.

We want to find out how many cups of water the siblings drink in one week. 

We can multiply the number of cups each sibling drinks per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

Theo drinks 8 cups per day, so in a week, Theo drinks 8 * 7 = 56 cups of water.
Mason drinks 7 cups per day, so in a week, Mason drinks 7 * 7 = 49 cups of water.
Roxy drinks 9 cups per day, so in a week, Roxy drinks 9 * 7 = 63 cups of water.

Now, let's add up the number of cups each sibling drinks in a week.

56 + 49 + 63 = 168

Answer: 168
