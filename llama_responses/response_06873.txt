Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of oregano plants. Since there are 2 more than twice as many oregano plants as basil plants, and there are 5 basil plants, the number of oregano plants is 2 x 5 = 10.

To find the total number of plants in the garden, we need to add the number of oregano plants to the number of basil plants. So, the total number of plants is 5 (basil plants) + 10 (oregano plants) = 15.

Answer: 15
