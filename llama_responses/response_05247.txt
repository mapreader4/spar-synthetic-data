Let's break down the information given into days of the week.  Monday through Saturday, Juanita spends $0.50.  Sunday, she spends $2.00.  So in total, she spends $0.50 + $2.00 = $2.50.  For the whole week, she spends $2.50.  The whole year is 52 weeks, so the total amount she spends is $2.50 x 52 = $130.00.  Grant spends $200.00 a year, so he spends $200.00.  The difference is $200.00 - $130.00 = $70.00.  So, Juanita spends $70.00 more than Grant.  Answer: $70.00.
