Let's break down the time Andy needs to get to school. 

He needs 30 minutes to get to school. If he left his house at 7:15, he has 7:15 - 8:00 = 45 minutes before school starts. 

He needs to stop for 3 minutes each at 4 red lights, so that will take 3 x 3 = 9 minutes. He also needs to wait 10 minutes to get past construction. 

So, in total, Andy will need 45 + 9 + 10 minutes. 45 + 9 = 54 minutes, so he will need 54 minutes to get to school. 

Since he left his house at 7:15, he will be 54 - 15 = 39 minutes late. 

Answer: 39
