Let's break this problem down step by step.

Beth's primary tank can last for 2 hours. She needs to stay underwater for 8 hours, so she will need to use the supplemental tanks to make up the difference.

The difference between 8 hours and 2 hours is 6 hours. Since each supplemental tank can last for 1 hour, Beth will need 6 supplemental tanks to last for 6 hours.

Answer: 6
