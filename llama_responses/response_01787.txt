Let's break this down step by step.

Kira fries 3 sausages. It takes 5 minutes to fry each sausage. So it will take 3 x 5 = 15 minutes to fry all the sausages.

Next, Kira scrambles 6 eggs. It takes 4 minutes to scramble each egg. So it will take 6 x 4 = 24 minutes to scramble all the eggs.

Adding the time taken for frying the sausages and scrambling the eggs, we get 15 + 24 = 39 minutes.

Answer: 39
