Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Angeli has 90 assorted candies.
* One-third of the candies were lollipops.
* The rest were candy canes.
* The lollipops were shared equally among the boys.
* The candy canes were shared equally among the girls.

Let's start by identifying the number of boys and girls. Since the lollipops were shared equally among the boys, and each boy received 3 lollipops, we can say that the number of boys is 3.

The candy canes were shared equally among the girls, and each girl received 2 candy canes. So, the number of girls is 2.

The total number of boys and girls are 3 + 2 = 5.
