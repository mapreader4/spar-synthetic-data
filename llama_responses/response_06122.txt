Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag. So, she has 4 x 20 = 80 apples in total.

Step 2: Ella has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag. So, she has 6 x 25 = 150 apples in total.

Step 3: Ella sells 200 apples. So, we need to find the total apples Ella has left after selling 200 apples.

Step 4: Ella has 80 apples initially. She sells 200 apples. So, we need to subtract the apples she sold from the total apples she had.

80 - 200 = - 120

Answer: 120
