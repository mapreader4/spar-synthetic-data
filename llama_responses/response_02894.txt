Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what Ian earned from doing online surveys.

Ian earned money by doing online surveys. He earned money for every hour he did surveys. If he worked 8 hours doing surveys, he earned money for 8 hours.

Now, let's find the total amount of money Ian earned.

Ian earned money for 8 hours. If he earns $18 per hour, then he earned:

8 x $18 = $144

Now, let's find out how much money he had left.

Ian had money. He spent half of the money he earned on doing online surveys. He spent half of $144.

Ian spent half of $144.

Ian has money left.

Half of $144 is $72.

Answer: $72
