Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the marks scored by Tatuya. Since Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, and Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy, we know that Tatuya scored 2 * (3/5) * Dorothy's marks.

We know that Dorothy scored 90 marks. So, we can substitute Dorothy's marks into the equation:

2 * (3/5) * 90 = 2 * 18 = 36

So, Tatuya scored 36 marks.

Now, we need to find the total marks scored by Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy. We know that Tatuya scored 36 marks, and we know that Ivanna scored 3/5 times Dorothy's marks, which is 3/5 * 90 = 54. So, Ivanna scored 54 marks.

To find the total marks scored by the three, we add the marks scored by Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy:

36 + 54 + 90 = 180

The average marks scored by the three is 180/3 = 60.

Answer: 60
