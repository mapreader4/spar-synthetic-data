Let's break this down step by step.

Melody has 3 dogs. Each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food. That means each dog eats 0.5 pounds of dog food.

If each dog eats 0.5 pounds of dog food, then 3 dogs eat 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 pounds of dog food in total.

Melody buys 30 pounds of dog food. If she gives 1.5 pounds to each dog, then she has 30 - 1.5 = 28.5 pounds of dog food left.

Answer: 28.5
