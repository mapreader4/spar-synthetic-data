Let's break it down step by step.

Randy had some money. Let's say he had x dollars. Then, Smith gave him $200. This means Randy now has x - 200 dollars.

Then, Randy gave Sally $1,200. This means Randy gave away 1200 dollars, so he had 2000 - 1200 = 800 dollars left.

So, Randy had 800 dollars at first.
