Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
- The problem states that Emberly takes her morning walks every day.
- The problem also states that each walk takes her 1 hour covering 4 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of miles walked.
- Emberly walks every day, which means she takes 7 days walks in a week (assuming a 7-day week).
- Each walk takes her 1 hour covering 4 miles, which means she walks 4 miles in 1 hour.
- Multiply the number of walks by the number of hours in a day, which is 7, to get the total number of miles walked in a week.
- 7 * 4 = 28

Answer: 28
