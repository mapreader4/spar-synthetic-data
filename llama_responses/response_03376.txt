Let's break this problem down step by step.

John's initial lifts were:

* Squat: 700
* Bench: 400
* Deadlift: 800

He lost 30% of his squat lift, which is 0.3 x 700 = 210 pounds. So his new squat lift is 700 - 210 = 490 pounds.

He didn't lose any weight on bench, so his bench lift remains the same, which is 400 pounds.

He lost 200 pounds on deadlift, so his new deadlift lift is 800 - 200 = 600 pounds.

To find John's new total, we add up his new squat, bench, and deadlift lifts:

490 + 400 + 600 = 1490

Answer: 1490
