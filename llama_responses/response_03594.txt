Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the original price of the dining table is x.

The sale price is 10% off the original price, so the sale price is 90% of the original price.

We know that the sale price is 450, so we can set up an equation to solve for the original price.

Let's write the equation:

0.9x = 450

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.9:

x = 450 / 0.9

x = 500

So the original price of the dining table was 500.

Answer: 500
