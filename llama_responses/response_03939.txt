Let's start by identifying the information given:

1. Patty's dress was $10 more than Ida's dress.
2. Ida's dress was $30 more than Jean's dress.
3. Jean's dress was $10 less than Pauline's dress.
4. Pauline's dress was $30.

Let's start with Pauline's dress, which is $30. Then, Jean's dress is $10 less than Pauline's dress, so Jean's dress is $20. Next, Ida's dress is $30 more than Jean's dress, so Ida's dress is $50. Lastly, Patty's dress is $10 more than Ida's dress, so Patty's dress is $60.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the dresses together:

$30 + $20 + $50 + $60 = $160

Answer: 160
