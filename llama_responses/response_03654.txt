Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of ducks Philip has: 50% of 20 cows is 10 ducks. So, Philip has 10 ducks.

Now, Philip has as many pigs as one-fifth of ducks and cows in total. Since he has 10 ducks and 20 cows, one-fifth of ducks and cows in total is 30. So, Philip has 30 pigs.

Now, let's add the number of ducks, pigs, and cows together. 10 + 30 + 20 = 60.

Answer: 60
