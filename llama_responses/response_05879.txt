Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that half of the total spots are located on Jean's upper torso, which is 30 spots. This means the total number of spots on her body is twice the number of spots on her upper torso, so the total number of spots is 2 x 30 = 60.

We also know that one-third of the total spots are located on her back and hindquarters, so the number of spots on her back and hindquarters is one-third of the total number of spots, which is 1/3 x 60 = 20.

To find the number of spots on her sides, we need to subtract the number of spots on her back and hindquarters from the total number of spots. We can do this by subtracting 20 from 60, which gives us:

60 - 20 = 40

So, Jean has 40 spots located on her sides.
