Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the base cost of the garbage bill. Mary has 2 trash bins and 1 recycling bin. Each week, she pays $10 per trash bin and $5 per recycling bin, so the weekly cost is:

2 trash bins x $10 per trash bin = $20 per week
1 recycling bin x $5 per recycling bin = $5 per week
Total weekly cost = $20 + $5 = $25 per week

Since there are 4 weeks in the month, the total monthly cost is:

$25 per week x 4 weeks = $100

However, Mary is getting an 18% discount on the whole bill, so we need to calculate the discount amount:

$100 x 0.18 = $18

Subtract the discount from the total monthly cost:

$100 - $18 = $82

But wait, there's a $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin. So, we need to add the fine to the discounted bill:

$82 + $20 = $102

Answer: 102
