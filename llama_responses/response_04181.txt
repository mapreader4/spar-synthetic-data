Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Hannah saved $4 in the first week. Then, she plans to save twice as much as the previous week. So, she will save 2 x 4 = 8 in the second week. In the third week, she will save twice as much as the previous week, which is 2 x 8 = 16. In the fourth week, she will save twice as much as the previous week, which is 2 x 16 = 32. In the fifth week, she will save twice as much as the previous week, which is 2 x 32 = 64.

So, in the fifth week, Hannah will save 64. Therefore, her total savings will be 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 84.
