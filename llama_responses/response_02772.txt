Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of seeds Shyne can grow. She can grow 14 eggplants in every seed packet, and she has 4 seed packets of eggplants, so she can grow a total of 14 * 4 = 56 eggplants. She can also grow 10 sunflowers in every seed packet, and she has 6 seed packets of sunflowers, so she can grow a total of 10 * 6 = 60 sunflowers.

To find the total number of plants Shyne can grow, we need to add the number of eggplants and sunflowers together. So, 56 (eggplants) + 60 (sunflowers) = 116 plants.

Answer: 116
