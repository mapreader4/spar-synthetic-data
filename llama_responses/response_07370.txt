Let's break this down step by step.

1. James gets 20 singing lessons. He gets the first lesson free, so he has 19 lessons left.

2. He pays for the first 10 lessons. So, he pays for 10 lessons and gets the 11th lesson free. Then, he pays for every other lesson. So, for the 12th lesson, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th lesson, and so on, he pays.

3. Each lesson is $5. So, for 10 lessons, he pays 10 x 5 = 50.

4. His uncle pays for half of that, so his uncle pays 50 / 2 = 25.

5. So, James pays 25.
