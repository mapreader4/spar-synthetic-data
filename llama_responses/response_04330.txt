Let's break down the information given:

* Simon has 20 more legos than Bruce.
* Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent.

We can start by letting x be the number of legos that Kent has. Then, we can write the equation:

x + 20 = Bruce's legos
Bruce's legos = Kent's legos + 20

We know that Kent has 40 legos, so we can substitute that into the equation:

x + 20 = 40 + 20

Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 20

So, Simon has 20 + 20 = 40 legos. Therefore, Simon has 60 legos.

Answer: 60
