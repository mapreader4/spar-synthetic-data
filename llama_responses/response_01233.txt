To solve this problem, I will break it down step by step.

1. Kevin ran for half an hour at 10 miles per hour, which is 5 miles.
2. Then, he ran for half an hour at 20 miles per hour, which is 10 miles.
3. Then, he ran for 15 minutes at 8 miles per hour, which is 1.25 miles.

To find the total distance traveled, I will add the distances together: 5 + 10 + 1.25 = 16 miles.

Answer: 16
