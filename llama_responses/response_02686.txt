Let's start by using variables to represent the amount of fish caught by each person.

Let's say Ali caught x kg of fish, Peter caught y kg of fish, and Joey caught z kg of fish. The total amount of fish caught is 25 kg.

We know that Ali caught twice as much as the fish that Peter caught, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

x = 2y

We also know that Joey caught 1 kg more fish than Peter, so we can add 1 to y:

y + 1 = z

The total amount of fish caught is 25 kg, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

x + y + z = 25

We can substitute the expressions we set up for x, y, and z:

x = 2y
y + 1 = z
x + y + z = 25

We can solve the equation by subtracting y + 1 from both sides:

x + y + z = 25 - (y + 1)

We can then solve for x:

x = 25 - y - 1

Now we can find the value of x:

x = 24

So Ali caught 24 kg of fish.
