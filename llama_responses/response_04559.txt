Let's start by identifying the units of the given quantities.

Marina has 4.5 pounds of fudge, which is the same as 720 ounces. Lazlo has 4 pounds of fudge, which is 16 ounces less than 4.5 pounds, or 16 ounces. To find the difference in ounces, we can subtract the ounces of fudge that Lazlo has from the total amount of ounces that Marina has. This gives us:

4.5 - 16 = 2.5

So, Marina has 2.5 ounces more fudge than Lazlo.
