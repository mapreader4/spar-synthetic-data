Let's break it down step by step:

1. James visits 20 houses the first day and sells something in every house, so he sells 20 items.
2. The next day, James visits twice as many houses as the first day, so he visits 2 * 20 = 40 houses.
3. On the second day, he sells to 80% of houses, so he sells 0.8 * 40 = 32 items.
4. Since James sells two things at each house, he sells 2 * 32 = 64 items.

Answer: 64
