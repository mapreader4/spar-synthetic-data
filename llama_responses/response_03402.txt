Let's break it down step by step:

1. The movie ticket costs $8.
2. The bucket of popcorn costs three dollars less than the movie ticket, so the popcorn costs $8 - 3 = $5.
3. The drink costs a dollar more than the popcorn, so the drink costs $5 + 1 = $6.
4. The candy costs half as much as the drink, so the candy costs $6 / 2 = $3.
5. The total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, drink, and candy is $8 + $5 + $6 + $3 = $20.

So, the deal saves the customer $20 - $20 = $0.
