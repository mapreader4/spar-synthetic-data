Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Tim spends 1 hour a day meditating.

Then, it is said that he spends twice as much time reading. So, to find the time spent reading, we multiply 1 hour by 2.

1 * 2 = 2

So, Tim spends 2 hours a day reading.

Since there are 7 days a week, we multiply 2 hours by 7.

2 * 7 = 14

So, the answer is: Answer: 14
