Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of guests that RSVP'd with a Yes response.

The number of guests that RSVP'd with a Yes response is 83% of 200 guests. To find 83% of 200, we can multiply 200 by 0.83, which gives us 166.

Now, let's find the number of guests that RSVP'd with a No response.

The number of guests that RSVP'd with a No response is 9% of 200. To find 9% of 200, we can multiply 200 by 0.09, which gives us 18.

To find the number of guests that did not respond at all, we can subtract the number of guests that RSVP'd with a Yes response from the total number of guests. 200 - 166 = 34.

Answer: 34
