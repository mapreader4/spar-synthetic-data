Let's break down the information:

There are 2 ducks with 5 ducklings each, which is 2 x 5 = 10 ducklings.
There are 6 ducks with 3 ducklings each, which is 6 x 3 = 18 ducklings.
There are 9 ducks with 6 ducklings each, which is 9 x 6 = 54 ducklings.

To find the total number of ducks and ducklings, we need to add 10, 18, and 54 together.

10 + 18 + 54 = 82

Answer: 82
