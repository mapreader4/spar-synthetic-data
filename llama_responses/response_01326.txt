Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let x be the original price of each tire. Since Gargamel bought 4 tires on sale, we know that the total amount he saved is $36.

We can set up an equation based on the information given:

4 x x = 75 - 36

We can subtract 36 from both sides of the equation to get:

4x = 39

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 39 / 4

x = 9.75

So, the original price of each tire was $9.75.

Answer: 9.75
