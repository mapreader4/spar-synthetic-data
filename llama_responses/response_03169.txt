Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate the number of months it takes for the grass to grow from 2 inches to 4 inches.

The grass grows 0.5 inches per month, so to get from 2 inches to 4 inches, it will take:

4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches of growth
2 inches / 0.5 inches/month = 4 months

So, it takes 4 months for the grass to grow from 2 inches to 4 inches.

Now, let's calculate the cost per year:

Cost per year = Cost per month x 12 months
Cost per year = 100 / 12
Cost per year = 100 / 12 = 8.33

Answer: 8.33
