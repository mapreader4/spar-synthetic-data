Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the game costs $60. We also know that Ronald and Max want to buy the game together, so they need to earn a total of $60. We also know that they earn $5 for each ice cream they sell.

Let's start by finding the total amount of money they need to earn. Since they need $60, and they earn $5 for each ice cream, we can set up an equation:

60 = 5x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

60 รท 5 = x

x = 12

So, they need to sell 12 ice creams to earn enough money to buy the game.
