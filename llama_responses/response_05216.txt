To find the average, we need to add all the scores together and divide by the number of tests. We know that Jacob has taken 5 tests. 

Let's add the scores together: 85 + 79 + 92 + 84 = 340. 

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 340 / 5 = 68. 

The average is 68, so Jacob must earn 68 on his fifth and final test to have an average of 85. 

Answer: 68
