Let's break this down step by step.

Let's find the total distance Jackie walks in 6 days. Since Jackie walks 2 miles each day, she walks a total of:

2 miles/day * 6 days = 12 miles

Now, let's find the total distance Jessie walks in 6 days. Since Jessie walks 1.5 miles each day, she walks a total of:

1.5 miles/day * 6 days = 9 miles

Now, let's subtract the total distance Jessie walks from the total distance Jackie walks:

12 miles - 9 miles = 3 miles

So, Jackie walks 3 more miles than Jessie in 6 days.
