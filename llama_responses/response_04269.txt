Let's break it down step by step.

First, Timothy buys 30 acres of land for $20 an acre, so the cost of the land is:

30 acres * $20 per acre = $600

Next, he builds a house for $120,000.

Next, he buys 20 cows for $1000 per cow, so the cost of the cows is:

20 cows * $1000 per cow = $20,000

He also buys 100 chickens for $5 per chicken, so the cost of the chickens is:

100 chickens * $5 per chicken = $500

The installation of the solar panels takes 6 hours and costs $100 per hour, so the labor cost is:

6 hours * $100 per hour = $600

The equipment cost is a flat fee of $6000.

To find the total cost, we add up the costs:

$600 (land) + $120,000 (house) + $20,000 (cows) + $500 (chickens) + $600 (labor) + $6000 (equipment) = $144,700
