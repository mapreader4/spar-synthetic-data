Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given. John ran the 5-mile race in 15 minutes. So, to find the speed he ran at, we can set up a proportion:

Let's call the speed of John's running speed 'x'. Then, we know that 5 miles is 5 times 1 mile. So, we can write an equation:

5 * x = 15

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 15 / 5
x = 3

So, John's speed is 3 mph.

Now, let's find out how many minutes he won the race by. The other guy took 23 minutes. To convert this to minutes, we can multiply 23 by 2:

23 * 2 = 46

The time difference is 46 minutes. So, John won the race by:

Answer: 46
