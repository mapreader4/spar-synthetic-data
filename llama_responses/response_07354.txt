Let's break this problem down step by step.

Helen cuts her lawn 2 times per month in March, April, September, and October, so in total, she cuts her lawn 6 times in these months. She cuts her lawn 4 times per month in May, June, July, and August, so in total, she cuts her lawn 12 times in these months.

Since the total number of times she cuts her lawn is 6 + 12 = 18, and she uses 2 gallons of gas every 4th time she cuts her lawn, we can find the total number of gallons of gas she uses by dividing 18 by 4.

18 / 4 = 4.5

Answer: 4
