Let's break it down step by step.

Phil has 10 books, each with 100 pages. So, the total number of pages is 10 * 100 = 1000.

During the move, 2 books are lost. This means that the total number of pages lost is 2 * 100 = 200.

To find the number of pages Phil has left, we subtract the number of pages lost from the total number of pages. So, we have:

1000 - 200 = 800

Answer: 800
