Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of flyers that Belinda passed out. Since Ryan passed out 42, Alyssa passed out 67, and Scott passed out 51, we can add these numbers together to get the total number of flyers that were passed out:

42 + 67 + 51 = 160

So, the total number of flyers that were passed out is 160.

Belinda passed out the rest of the flyers, which is 200 - 160 = 40.

So, the percentage of flyers that Belinda passed out is:

(40 / 200) * 100 = 20%

Answer: 20
