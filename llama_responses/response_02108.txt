Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Adam bought 15 apples.
On Tuesday, he bought 3 times that quantity, so he bought 15 x 3 = 45 apples.
On Wednesday, he bought 4 times the quantity he bought on Tuesday, so he bought 45 x 4 = 180 apples.
To find the total quantity Adam bought, we add the apples he bought on each day: 15 + 45 + 180 = 240.
Answer: 240
