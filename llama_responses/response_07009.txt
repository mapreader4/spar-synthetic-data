Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

* Pablo's mother pays him one cent for every page he reads.
* Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages.
* Pablo bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover.

We know that Pablo's mother pays him one cent for every page he reads, so if he reads a book with 150 pages, he will earn $1.50.

Since Pablo bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover, we know that he must have read some number of books that total $12 worth of books.

Since each book is 150 pages, we can divide $12 by 150 to find the number of books Pablo read:

$12 รท 150 = 0.08

Since Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages, we know that he read 8 books.

Answer: 8
