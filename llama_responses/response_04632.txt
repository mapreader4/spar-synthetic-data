Let's first find the total cost of the meal. Julie's order is 10 dollars, Letitia's order is 20 dollars, and Anton's order is 30 dollars. 10 + 20 + 30 is 60. The total cost is 60 dollars. 

To find the tip, we multiply the total cost by 0.2. 60 * 0.2 is 12. 

Now we need to divide 12 by 3. 12 / 3 is 4. So each person should pay 4 dollars. 

Answer: 4
