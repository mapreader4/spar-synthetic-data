Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the price of the most expensive lamp. The most expensive lamp is 3 times the price of the cheapest lamp, which is $20. So, the price of the most expensive lamp is 3 * 20 = $60.

Frank currently has $90. If he buys the most expensive lamp, he will have spent $60. To find out how much money he has remaining, we subtract the price of the lamp from his initial amount:

$90 - $60 = $30

So, Frank will have $30 remaining after buying the most expensive lamp.
