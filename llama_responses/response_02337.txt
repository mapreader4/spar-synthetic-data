Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total cost of the shirts for each grade level.

For the 101 kindergartners, the cost is 101 x 5.80 = 507.80.

For the 113 first graders, the cost is 113 x 5 = 565.

For the 107 second graders, the cost is 108 x 5.60 = 540.

For the 108 third graders, the cost is 108 x 5.25 = 540.25.

Now, let's add up the costs for all the grades:

507.80 + 565 + 540 + 540.25 = 1652.05.

The P.T.O. spent 1652.05 on shirts for field day.
