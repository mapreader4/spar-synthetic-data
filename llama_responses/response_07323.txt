Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The flight leaves at 8:00 pm.
2. They need to check in 2 hours early, so they need to be at the airport by 6:00 pm.
3. It will take 45 minutes to drive to the airport, so they need to leave their house by 5:15 pm.
4. It will take another 15 minutes to park and get to the terminal, so they need to leave their house by 5:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest they can leave their house to make it to the airport in time is 5:00 pm.
