Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by using the information given: "Miss Aisha's legs are 1/3 of her total height."

This means that the length of her legs is 1/3 of her total height. Let's say her total height is x. Then, the length of her legs is x/3.

Next, we are told that her head is 1/4 of her total height, which means that the length of her head is x/4.

We are given that Miss Aisha is 60 inches tall. We can use this information to set up an equation:

x/3 = 60

We can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get:

x = 60 * 3

x = 180

Now, we know that x is 180. Now, we can find the length of the rest of her body. We are told that the length of her legs is x/3, so the length of the rest of her body is:

180 - (180/3)

180 - 60 = 120

So, the length of the rest of her body is 120 inches.

Answer: 120
