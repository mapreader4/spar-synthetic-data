Let's break this down step by step.

The secretary has been working for 6 years. This means that she has had a total of 72 months of experience.

Her current salary is €10,000 a month. This is the total amount she earns per month.

A 2% increase means that her new salary will be 2% more than her current salary.

To find her new salary, we can multiply her current salary by 1.02, which is 1 + 0.02.

€10,000 * 1.02 = €10,000 * 1.02 = €10,000 * 1.02 = €10,200

So, the secretary's new salary is €10,200.
