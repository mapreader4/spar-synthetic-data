Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with Verna, who weighs 17 pounds more than Haley. If Haley weighs 103 pounds, then Verna must weigh 103 + 17 = 120 pounds.

Next, we know that Verna weighs half as much as Sherry. So, if Verna weighs 120 pounds, then Sherry weighs 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of Verna and Sherry together, we add their individual weights: 120 + 60 = 180 pounds.

Answer: 180
