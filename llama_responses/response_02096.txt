Let x be the number of cans of corn that Beth bought. Since she bought 15 more cans of peas than twice the number of cans of corn, and 15 = 2x, then we can set up the equation:

15 = 2x

x = 7.5

Since the number of cans of corn is an integer, x must be 7. So, she bought 7 cans of corn.

Answer: 7
