Let's break down the problem step by step.

Vinny lost 20 pounds in the first month, so he weighed 300 - 20 = 280 pounds at the end of the first month.

In the second month, he lost half of 20 pounds, which is 10 pounds. So, he weighed 280 - 10 = 270 pounds at the end of the second month.

In the third month, he lost half of 10 pounds, which is 5 pounds. So, he weighed 270 - 5 = 265 pounds at the end of the third month.

In the fourth month, he lost half of 5 pounds, which is 2.5 pounds. So, he weighed 265 - 2.5 = 262.5 pounds at the end of the fourth month.

At the start of the fifth month, he weighed 262.5 pounds. Since he weighed 250.5 pounds at the end of the fifth month, he lost 262.5 - 250.5 = 12 pounds throughout the fifth month.
