To find the total number of miles the two friends run, we need to find the total distance each of them runs and then add those distances together.

Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam, so Sam runs 12 miles. To find the distance Harvey runs, we add 8 to 12, which is 20.

So, Sam runs 12 miles and Harvey runs 20 miles. To find the total distance they run together, we add 12 + 20, which is 32.

Answer: 32
