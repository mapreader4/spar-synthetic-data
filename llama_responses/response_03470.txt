Let's break it down step by step.

The labor cost is $75 per hour, and there are 16 hours of labor required. So, the labor cost is:

$75 x 16 = $1200

The part itself cost $1200.

To find the total cost, we need to add the labor cost and the part cost together:

$1200 + $1200 = $2400

Answer: 2400
