Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many feet Matt will climb in 7 minutes at his rate of 6 feet per minute.

Matt climbs 6 feet per minute, so in 7 minutes, he will climb 6 * 7 = 42 feet.

Now, let's find out how many feet Jason will climb in 7 minutes at his rate of 12 feet per minute.

Jason climbs 12 feet per minute, so in 7 minutes, he will climb 12 * 7 = 84 feet.

Now, we can find the difference in the heights they will be at. Jason will climb 84 feet, which is 42 feet more than Matt.

Answer: 42
