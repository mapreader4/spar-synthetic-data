Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Harper collected 30% more candy than Maggie, and Maggie collected 50 pieces. So, Harper must have collected 50 + 30% more candy. To calculate the total number of candy Harper collected, we can multiply 50 by 1.3 to get 65. 

Neil collected 40% more candy than Harper. We know that Neil collected 40% more candy than Harper. 40% of 65 is 26. So, Neil collected 65 + 26 = 91 pieces of candy. 

Answer: 91
