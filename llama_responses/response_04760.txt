Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by using the information that John weighs one-quarter times more than what Mary weighs. We know that Mary weighs 160 lbs, so John's weight is 160 * (1/4) + 160 = 200 lbs.

Next, we know that Mary weighs 20 lbs less than Jamison's weight. So, Jamison's weight is 160 + 20 = 180 lbs.

To find the combined weight of the three, we add up their weights:

200 + 160 + 180 = 440 lbs

Answer: 440
