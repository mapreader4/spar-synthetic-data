Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the age of Stephanie. Since Stephanie is 4 times as old as Job, and Job is 5, then Stephanie's age is 5 * 4 = 20.

Step 2: Now, we know Freddy is 2 years younger than Stephanie. Since Stephanie is 20 years old, Freddy's age is 20 - 2 = 18.

Answer: 18
