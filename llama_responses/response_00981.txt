Let's break this down step by step:

Olga has 3 stripes per shoe, so she has 3 x 2 = 6 stripes per pair of shoes.

Rick has 1 less stripe per shoe than Olga, so Rick has 3 - 1 = 2 stripes per shoe. Since Rick has a pair of shoes, he has 2 x 2 = 4 stripes.

Hortense has double the number of stripes as Olga, so Hortense has 2 x 3 = 6 stripes per shoe. Since Hortense has a pair of shoes, she has 6 x 2 = 12 stripes.

To find the combined number of stripes, we add the number of stripes from each of them:

6 (Olga's) + 4 (Rick's) + 12 (Hortense's) = 22

Answer: 22
