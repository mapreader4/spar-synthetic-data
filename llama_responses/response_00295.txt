Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Pam has x bags of apples. Each of her bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags. So, we can say that Pam's bags have 3x apples each.

Gerald's bags have 40 apples each, so the total number of apples in his bags is 40.

Pam has 1200 apples in total. Since each of her bags has 3x apples, the total number of apples in her bags is 3x. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

3x = 1200

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = 1200 / 3
x = 400

So, Pam has 400 bags of apples.
