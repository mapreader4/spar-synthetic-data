Let's break it down step by step:

Janet goes to the gym for 5 hours a week. She goes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

She spends an hour and a half each day on Monday and Wednesday. This means that on Monday and Wednesday, she spends a total of 2 hours at the gym.

The total hours she spends at the gym in a week is 5 hours. We know that she spends 2 hours on Monday and Wednesday, so the remaining hours are 5 - 2 = 3 hours.

She spends the same amount of time at the gym on Tuesday and Friday, so she spends 3/2 hours at the gym on Friday.
