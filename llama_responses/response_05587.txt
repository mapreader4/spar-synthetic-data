Let's break this problem down step by step.

I have 5 blue apples. My neighbor gives me twice as many yellow apples as I have blue apples. So, I get 2 times 5 blue apples, which is 10 yellow apples. Now, I have 5 blue apples and 10 yellow apples.

I give my son 1/5 of the total number of apples. The total number of apples is 15 (5 blue + 10 yellow). 1/5 of 15 is 3. So, I give my son 3 apples.

I am left with 5 blue apples and 10 - 3 = 7 yellow apples. So, the answer is 7.
