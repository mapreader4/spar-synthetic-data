Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using a variable to represent the price of the pants, let's say it's x.

We know that the price of the shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants, so we can write that as an equation: 1/4x.

We also know that the price of the shoe is ten dollars more than the price of the pants, so we can write that as an equation: x + 10.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given: 1/4x + x + 10 = 340.

We can add -x to both sides of the equation to get 3/4x = 330.

We can then multiply both sides by 4 to get 3x = 1320.

Finally, we can divide both sides by 3 to get x = 440.

Answer: 440
