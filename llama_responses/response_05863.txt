Let's break this down step by step.

1. Mary starts with 40 ounces of raw spinach.

2. She cooks it until it's 20% of its initial volume, which means it becomes 80% of its original volume. So, 40 * 0.8 = 32 ounces.

3. She mixes the cooked spinach with 6 ounces of cream cheese.

4. Then, she adds 4 ounces of eggs.

5. To find the total volume, we add the volume of the cooked spinach (32 ounces) to the volume of the cream cheese (6 ounces) and eggs (4 ounces).

6. So, we have: 32 + 6 + 4 = 42 ounces.

Answer: 42
