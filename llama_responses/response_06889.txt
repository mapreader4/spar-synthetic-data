Let's break it down step by step.

Ben has $2000 initially.

He writes a cheque for $600 to his supplier, which means he's spending $600.

So, he has $2000 - $600 = $1400 left.

Then, he receives $800 from his debtor, so he now has $1400 + $800 = $2200.

After spending $1200 on equipment maintenance, he has $2200 - $1200 = $1000 left.

Answer: 1000
