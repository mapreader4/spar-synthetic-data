Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the time it takes to cross the lake. Tom needs to cross the lake twice, once going and once coming back. So, the total time is 2 x 4 = 8 hours.

Since Tom needs an assistant for 8 hours, and the cost is $10 per hour, the total cost would be 8 x 10 = 80.

So, Tom would have to pay 80 dollars to have an assistant to help him cross the lake back and forth.
