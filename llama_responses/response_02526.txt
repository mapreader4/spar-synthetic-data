Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Nate ran a distance equal to four times the length of a football field. A football field is 168 meters long, so four times that length is 4 x 168 = 672 meters.

Nate rested for a while, then ran 500 more meters. So, we need to add 500 meters to the total distance he ran. The total distance Nate ran is 672 + 500 = 1172 meters.

Answer: 1172
