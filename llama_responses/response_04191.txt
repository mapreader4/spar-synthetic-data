Let's break this down step by step.

James has 20 years of experience.
John had 8 years ago, so he had 20 - 8 = 12 years of experience.
Mike started when John had 16 years of experience, so Mike had 20 - 16 = 4 years of experience.

To find the total experience, we add the experience of James, John, and Mike:

20 + 12 + 4 = 36

Answer: 36
