Let's start by identifying the information given:

Jerry has 8 more toys than Gabriel.
Gabriel has twice as many toys as Jaxon.
Jaxon has 15 toys.

From the second statement, we know that Gabriel has 15 / 2 = 7.5 toys. But since Gabriel is not a half, so he has 7 toys.

So, we can add the number of toys for Jerry, Gabriel, and Jaxon:

Jerry: 8
Gabriel: 7
Jaxon: 15

We add the number of toys: 8 + 7 + 15 = 30

Answer: 30
