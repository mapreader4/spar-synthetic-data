Let's break down the possible outcomes for each lawsuit:

Lawsuit 1:
- Win: 30% chance of winning and getting $5,000,000
- Lose: 70% chance of losing and getting $0

Lawsuit 2:
- Lose: 50% chance of losing and getting $1,000,000
- Win: 50% chance of winning and getting $2,000,000

To calculate the probability of winning both lawsuits, we multiply the probabilities of winning each lawsuit:

30% (winning lawsuit 1) * 50% (winning lawsuit 2) = 15%

To calculate the probability of losing both lawsuits, we multiply the probabilities of losing each lawsuit:

70% (losing lawsuit 1) * 50% (losing lawsuit 2) = 35%

To find the difference between the two probabilities, subtract the probability of winning both lawsuits from the probability of losing both lawsuits:

35% - 15% = 20%

So, it's 20% more likely that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them.
