Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Peter drew 8 pictures.
2. Quincy drew 20 more pictures than Peter, so Quincy drew 8 + 20 = 28 pictures.
3. Randy, Peter, and Quincy drew 41 pictures altogether.
4. We know that Randy drew some pictures, but we don't know how many Randy drew. We know that Randy drew some, but we don't know how many.

To find the number of pictures Randy drew, we can subtract the number of pictures Peter and Quincy drew from the total number of pictures drawn. So, we have:

41 (total number of pictures) - 8 (number of pictures Peter drew) - 28 (number of pictures Quincy drew) =?

Let's do the subtraction.

41 - 8 = 33
41 - 28 = 13

So, Randy drew 13 pictures.
