Let's break this down step by step.

1. The poem currently has 24 lines.
2. If the poem has 3 lines added to it every month, then in each month, the poem will have 24 + 3 lines.
3. This will happen for 90 months, so in 90 months, the poem will have 24 + 90 * 3 lines.
4. 24 + 90 * 3 = 288.

Answer: 288
