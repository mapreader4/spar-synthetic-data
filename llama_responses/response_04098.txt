Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many ounces of coffee Colston's teacher drinks each day.

She makes her coffee twice a day, and each time she pours 1/2 cup of milk, which is 8 ounces. So, she drinks 2 x 8 = 16 ounces of coffee per day.

For the whole week, she drinks 16 ounces per day for 5 days. So, the total amount of coffee she drinks in a week is 16 x 5 = 80 ounces.

Now, she decides to drink 1/4 of what she normally drinks, so she drinks 80 x 1/4 = 20 ounces of coffee.
