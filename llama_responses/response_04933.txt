Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: 

Gloria has 5 times as many dimes as quarters in her graduation money. This means that the number of quarters is 5 times the number of dimes. 

The number of dimes is 350. So, the number of quarters is 350 / 5 = 70.

Gloria decides to put 2/5 of the quarters aside. This means that 2/5 of 70 quarters will be set aside. 

2/5 of 70 is 2 * (70 / 5) = 2 * 14 = 28.

So, Gloria has 70 - 28 = 42 quarters left.

She has 350 dimes. 

So, the total number of quarters and dimes is 42 + 350 = 392. 

Answer: 392
