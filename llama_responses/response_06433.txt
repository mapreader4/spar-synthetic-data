Let's break it down step by step.

1. There are 48 crayons initially.
2. Kiley takes 1/4 of them away, which is 48 x 1/4 = 12 crayons.
3. 48 - 12 = 36 crayons are left.
4. Joe takes away half of the remaining crayons, which is 36/2 = 18 crayons.
5. So, there are 36 - 18 = 18 crayons left.

Answer: 18
