Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of wipes in the container in the morning is x.

After using 20 wipes, the number of wipes left is x - 20.

Then, she refills the container with 10 wipes. So, the new number of wipes is x - 20 + 10.

Since the number of wipes left at night is 60, we can set up an equation:

x - 20 + 10 = 60

Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 80

So, the number of wipes in the container in the morning is 80.
