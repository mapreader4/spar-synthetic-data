Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Chris takes t hours to walk 9 miles to school. Since Chris walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, we can set up an equation to represent the time it takes Chris to get to school:

t * 3 = 9

We can solve for t by dividing both sides by 3:

t = 9 / 3
t = 3

So it takes Chris 3 hours to get to school.

Now, Mark walks 3 miles and then turns around and goes home. This means that Mark walks a total of 6 miles. Since Mark also walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, we can find the time it takes Mark to get home by setting up an equation:

6 / 3 = t

We can solve for t by dividing both sides by 3:

t = 6 / 3
t = 2

So it takes Mark 2 hours to get home.

Since Mark and Chris leave at the same time, Mark spends 2 hours more than Chris to get home. So the answer is:

Answer: 2
