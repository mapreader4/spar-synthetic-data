Let's break down the problem step by step.

There are 3 sides to the shower, so we need to find the total number of tiles on each side. The width of the wall is the same for each side, so we can find the total number of tiles on one side, and then multiply it by 3 to get the total number of tiles on all 3 sides.

The width of the wall is 8 tiles. So, the number of tiles on one side is 8. Multiply that by 3, we get 24. Then, we add the number of tiles on the other two sides to get the total number of tiles.

Total number of tiles = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24

Answer: 24
