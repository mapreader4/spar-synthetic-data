Let's break this down step by step.

Jeff had 300 pencils. He donated 30% of them. 30% of 300 is 0.9 * 300 = 270. So, Jeff has 30 pencils left.

Vicki had twice as many pencils as Jeff. So Vicki has 2 * 30 = 60 pencils. He donated 3/4 of them. 3/4 of 60 is 0.75 * 60 = 45. So Vicki has 60 - 45 = 15 pencils left.

So, the total number of pencils left is 30 + 15 = 45.

Answer: 45
