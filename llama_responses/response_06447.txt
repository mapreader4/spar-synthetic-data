Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money they have between them.

Emmy has $200 and Gerry has $100, so together they have $200 + $100 = $300.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the apples they want to buy.

The apples cost $2 each, so the cost of 1 apple is $2. To find the number of apples they can buy, we can divide the total amount of money they have by the cost of 1 apple.

$300 รท $2 = 150

Answer: 150
