Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the cost of the two cameras: 2 x $110 = $220.
2. Next, let's calculate the cost of the three digital photo frames: 3 x $120 = $360.
3. To get a 5% discount, the total cost is 95% of the total cost. To calculate this, we can multiply the total cost by 0.95 to get the discounted cost. So, the total cost is 0.95 x ($220 + $360) = $540.
4. Finally, we add the cost of the cameras and photo frames together: $540.

Answer: 540
