Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Natalie gets half of the $10,000, so she gets $5,000.
2. Rick gets 60% of the remaining money, so we need to find 60% of the remaining amount. 60% of the remaining money is 60% of 5,000, which is 0.6 * 5000 = 3,000. So, Rick gets $3,000.
3. After Natalie and Rick get their shares, the remaining money left is $5,000 - $3,000 = $2,000.
4. Lucy will get the remaining money, which is $2,000.

Answer: 2000
