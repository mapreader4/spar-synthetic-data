Let's break this down step by step.

Haylee has 3 dozen guppies, which is equal to 36 guppies.

Jose has half as many guppies as Haylee, so Jose has 36 / 2 = 18 guppies.

Charliz has one-third of what Jose has, so Charliz has 18 / 3 = 6 guppies.

Nicolai has 4 times as many guppies as Charliz, so Nicolai has 6 x 4 = 24 guppies.

To find the total number of guppies the four friends have, we add the number of guppies each of them has: 36 + 18 + 6 + 24 = 78.

Answer: 78
