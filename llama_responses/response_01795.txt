Let's break down the information given:

* Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie.
* Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected.
* Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles.

Let's start by identifying the number of red marbles Mary collected. Since Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, and Jenny collected 30 red marbles, Mary collected 30/2 = 15 red marbles.

Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected 15 + 20 = 35 red marbles.

Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, and Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, so Anie collected 25 * 2 = 50 blue marbles.

Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50/2 = 25 blue marbles.

The total number of blue marbles collected by the friends is the sum of the blue marbles collected by Mary, Anie, and Jenny. That is, 25 + 50 + 25 = 100 blue marbles.

Answer: 100
