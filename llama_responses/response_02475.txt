Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sarah bought 12 lollipops for 3 dollars. So, each lollipop costs 3 dollars divided by 12, which is 0.25 dollars.

2. Sarah shared one-quarter of the lollipops with Julie. So, Sarah shared 12 * 1/4 = 3 lollipops with Julie.

3. The cost of the shared lollipops is the cost of 3 lollipops, which is 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 dollars.

4. Julie reimbursed Sarah for the cost of the shared lollipops, so Julie gave Sarah 0.75 dollars.

Answer: 75
