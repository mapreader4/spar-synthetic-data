Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center. This means that the Chrysler Building has more floors than the Leeward Center.

Next, we know that together they have a total of 35 floors. This means that the Chrysler Building and the Leeward Center have 35 floors in total.

To find the number of floors the Chrysler Building has, we can subtract the number of floors the Leeward Center has from the total number of floors they have together. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Let the number of floors the Chrysler Building has be x. Then, we can set up the equation as:

x + Leeward Center's number of floors = 35

Since we know that the Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 35 - 11
x = 24

So, the Chrysler Building has 24 floors.
