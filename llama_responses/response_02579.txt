Let's break it down step by step.

First, Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. So, she had a total of 4 * 8 = 32 crayons.

She gave 5 crayons to Mae. That means she has 32 - 5 = 27 crayons left.

Then, she gave some crayons to Lea. Let's say she gave x crayons to Lea. Since she has 27 crayons left, we know that 27 - x = 15. So, x = 12.

So, Nori gave 12 more crayons to Lea than Mae.
