Let's start by identifying the variables in the problem. We have the cost of diesel fuel, which is $3 per gallon, and the amount Mr. Alvarez spends on diesel fuel in a week. We can represent the cost per week as a variable, let's say it is x.

We know that Mr. Alvarez spends $36 on diesel fuel each week, so the total cost in two weeks would be 2 times the cost per week, which is 2 x $36. Since the cost of diesel fuel is $3 per gallon, we can set up an equation to solve for x, the number of gallons of diesel fuel Mr. Alvarez uses in two weeks.

We can set up the equation as follows:

2 x $36 = x x $3

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by $3:

x = (2 x $36) / $3

x = 72 / $3

x = 24

Answer: 24
