Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the fuel needed for the plane without any passengers or bags. For the empty plane, the fuel needed is 20 gallons per mile. For a 400-mile trip, we need to multiply 20 gallons per mile by 400 miles. 20 x 400 = 8000 gallons.

Now, let's consider the passengers. Each person increases the fuel needed by 3 gallons per mile. There are 30 passengers, so that's 30 x 3 = 90 gallons more fuel needed. 8000 + 90 = 8090 gallons.

Now, let's consider the bags. Each bag increases the fuel needed by 2 gallons per mile. There are 5 bags, and each person has 2 bags, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 more gallons of fuel needed. 8090 + 10 = 8100 gallons.

So, the total fuel needed for the plane is 8100 gallons.

Answer: 8100
