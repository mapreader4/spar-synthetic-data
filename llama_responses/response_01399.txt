Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be Austin's height.

The highest wave he caught was two feet higher than four times his height, so we can set up the equation 2 + 4x = y, where y is the height of the highest wave.

The shortest wave he caught was four feet higher than his height, so we can set up the equation 4 + x = y.

The shortest wave was three feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard is long. So we know that 7 - 3 = 4, so his surfboard is 4 feet long.

Now, we can substitute 4 for x in the equation 2 + 4x = y, and get y = 2 + 4x.

We can solve for x by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation and get x = 2.

So, the height of the highest wave Austin caught is 2 + 4(2) = 8 feet.
