Let's break down the time Haley spent on each activity:

* Shopping for the telescope: 2 hours
* Setting up the telescope: 0.5 hours = 30 minutes
* Making snacks: 3 times the setup time = 1.5 hours
* Watching the comet: 0.33 hours = 20 minutes

The total time spent on all activities is the sum of these: 2 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 0.33 = 4 hours.

The time spent watching the comet is 0.33 hours, which is 8.25% of the total time. To round this to the nearest percent, I would round it to 8%.
