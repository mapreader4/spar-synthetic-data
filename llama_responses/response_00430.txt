Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Tanya bought a total of 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and some plums. We can add these numbers together to get the total number of fruits she bought before any fell out of the bag:

6 (pears) + 4 (apples) + 2 (pineapples) = 12

Now, we know that half of the fruit fell out of the bag, so we need to find half of the total number of fruits she bought:

12 / 2 = 6

This means that 6 fruits fell out of the bag. Since there are only 9 fruits left in the bag, we can subtract 6 from 9 to find out how many fruits were in the bag initially:

9 - 6 = 3

This means that 3 fruits were left in the bag after half of the fruit fell out. Since Tanya bought some plums, and we know that there are 9 fruits left in the bag, we can subtract the number of fruits that are not plums from 9 to find the number of plums:

9 - 6 (pears) - 4 (apples) - 2 (pineapples) =?

This simplifies to:

9 - 12 =?

Which is:

-3

Wait, this can't be right! We can't have a negative number of plums. This means that our assumption that there are 9 fruits left in the bag is incorrect.

Let's go back to the problem and think about it again. We know that half of the fruit fell out of the bag, and there are 9 fruits left in the bag. This means that the other half of the fruit must be in the bag. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Fruits in bag = Total fruits - Fruits that fell out

9 = Total fruits - 6

We can add 6 to both sides of the equation to get:

15 = Total fruits

This means that Tanya bought a total of 15 fruits. We know that 6 pears, 4 apples, and 2 pineapples were in the bag initially, so we can subtract these numbers from 15 to find the number of plums:

15 - 6 - 4 - 2 =?

This simplifies to:

3

Answer: 3
