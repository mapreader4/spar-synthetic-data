Let's break this problem down step by step.

Donna cut the pizza into 12 slices.  So, we have 12 slices.

She ate half of them for lunch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 slices.

Then, she ate 1/3 of the remaining pizza for dinner.  1/3 of 6 is 6 / 3 = 2 slices.

So, she ate 2 slices for dinner.

To find out how many slices are left for Donna's lunch tomorrow, we subtract the 2 slices she ate for dinner from the remaining 6 slices: 6 - 2 = 4 slices.

Answer: 4
