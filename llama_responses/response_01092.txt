Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many blankets have polka-dots. Since Estevan has 24 blankets, and one-third of them have polka-dots, that means that 1/3 of 24 = 8 blankets have polka-dots.

Now, his mother gives him 2 more polka-dot print blankets. So, we need to add 2 to the number of blankets with polka-dots. So, the total number of polka-dot blankets Estevan has is:

8 (initially) + 2 (additional) = 10.

Answer: 10
