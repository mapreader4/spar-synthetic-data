Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the initial amount of liters in the barrel. The barrel has 220 liters.

Now, let's identify the amount of liters that leaked. The barrel lost 10% of its contents, which means that 10% of 220 liters leaked out.

To find the amount of liters that leaked, we can multiply the initial amount of liters by the percentage that leaked. 10% of 220 is the same as 0.1 x 220, which is 22.

So, the amount of liters that leaked is 22 liters.

Now, to find the amount of liters left in the barrel, we subtract the amount that leaked from the initial amount. We subtract 22 from 220, which leaves us with:

220 - 22 = 198

So, the answer is:

Answer: 198
