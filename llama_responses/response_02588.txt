Let's break this problem down step by step.

The outside doors cost 20 dollars each, so the total cost to replace the outside doors is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.

The bedroom doors are half the cost of the outside doors, so the cost to replace the bedroom doors is 20/2 = 10 dollars.

The total cost to replace all the doors is the cost of the outside doors plus the cost of the bedroom doors. So, the total cost is 40 + 10 = 50 dollars.

Answer: 50
