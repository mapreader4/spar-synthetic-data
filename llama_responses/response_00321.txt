Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that 5 months ago, Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred. So, let's let's call Fred's salary 1000. We also know that Mike's salary has increased by 40 percent now.

To find Mike's current salary, we need to multiply his salary by 1.4 (100% + 40%). So, his new salary is 1.4 times his old salary. Since we know his old salary was 10 times Fred's salary, which is 1000, his new salary is:

1000 * 1.4 = 1400

So, Mike's salary now is 1400.

Answer: 1400
