Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us: "Trent caught 180 tadpoles and let 75% of them go." We know that 75% of 180 tadpoles is equal to 135 tadpoles.

To find the number of tadpoles that Trent kept, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that were let go from the total number of tadpoles. So, if 180 - 135 = 45 tadpoles were kept.

Answer: 45
