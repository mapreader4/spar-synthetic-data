Let's break this problem down step by step.

In 2004, there were 60 kids at the cookout.

In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout, which means the number of kids in 2005 is half of 60. To find the number of kids in 2005, I'll divide 60 by 2:

60 รท 2 = 30

So, there were 30 kids at the cookout in 2005.

In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. To find the number of kids in 2006, I'll multiply the number of kids in 2005 by 2/3:

30 ร 2/3 = 20

So, there were 20 kids at the cookout in 2006.

Answer: 20
