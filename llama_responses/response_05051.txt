Let's break this down step by step.

On the first day, Eliana walked 200 steps.

On the second day, she walked 2 times the number of steps she walked on the first day, which is 2 x 200 = 400 steps.

On the third day, she walked 100 more steps.

So, the total number of steps Eliana walked is 200 + 400 + 100 = 700.
