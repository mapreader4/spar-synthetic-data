Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Allen is 25 years younger than his mother. So, the age of his mother is 25 + 3 = 28.

The problem asks for the sum of their ages in 3 years. So, in 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 28 + 3 = 31.

But we want the age of Allen's mother. So, the answer is 28 - 25 = 3.
