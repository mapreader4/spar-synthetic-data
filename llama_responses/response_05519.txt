Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that there are 30 students who brought in brownies, 20 students who brought in cookies, and 15 students who brought in donuts.

2. The number of brownies is 30. Each brownie costs $2.00, so the total amount of money from the brownies is 30 x $2.00 = $60.

3. The number of cookies is 20. Each cookie costs $2.00, so the total amount of money from the cookies is 20 x $2.00 = $40.

4. The number of donuts is 15. Each donut costs $2.00, so the total amount of money from the donuts is 15 x $2.00 = $30.

5. To find the total amount of money raised, we add the amount of money from the brownies, cookies, and donuts: $60 + $40 + $30 = $130.

Answer: 130
