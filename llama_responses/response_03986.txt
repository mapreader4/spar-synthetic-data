Let's start by letting x be the original number of sweets in the pack. Then, we know that 4 sweets are taken, so we can write an equation to represent this:

x - 4 = (x - 3/3)

We can solve this equation to find the value of x:

x = 48

Now, we can plug this value back into our original equation:

48 - 4 = (48 - 3/3)
