Let's break this down step by step.

Trey has 5 times as many turtles as Kris. That means Kris has 5 turtles.

Kristen has one fourth the turtles that Kris has. So, Kristen has 5 / 4 = 1.25 turtles.

To find the total number of turtles, we need to add the number of turtles Trey has to the number of turtles Kristen has. So, we add 5 + 1.25 = 6.

Answer: 6
