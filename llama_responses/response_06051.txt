Let's start by calculating the total weight of the puppies:

4 puppies * 7.5 kilograms = 30 kilograms

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the cats:

14 cats * 2.5 kilograms = 35 kilograms

To find the difference in weight between the cats and the puppies, we subtract the weight of the puppies from the weight of the cats:

35 kilograms (cats) - 30 kilograms (puppies) = 5 kilograms

So, the cats weigh 5 kilograms more than the puppies.
