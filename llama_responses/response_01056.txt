Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of potatoes. She wants to cut up six times as many carrots as potatoes, and she has 2 potatoes. So, we can multiply 6 x 2 = 12.

Next, she wants to cut up twice as many onions as carrots as potatoes, so if she has 12 carrots, she wants to cut up 2 x 12 = 24 onions.

Finally, she wants to cut 1/3 as many green beans as onions. So, if she cuts up 24 onions, she wants to cut 1/3 of that, which is 24 / 3 = 8 green beans.

So, Maria needs to cut 8 green beans.
