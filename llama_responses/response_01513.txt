Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Let's start with the information given: The cat is 8 years old, the rabbit is half the age of the cat, and the dog is three times as old as the rabbit.

2. Let's find the age of the rabbit. Since the rabbit is half the age of the cat, and the cat is 8 years old, the age of the rabbit is 4 years.

3. Now, let's find the age of the dog. The dog is three times as old as the rabbit, so the age of the dog is 4 years * 3 = 12 years.

4. Therefore, the dog is 12 years old.

Answer: 12
