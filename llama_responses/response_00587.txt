Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of hours spent catching up with his Facebook pals on the weekend. Since he spends three times as many hours catching up with his friends on the weekend as he does working, and he spends 3 hours catching up, the number of hours spent catching up is 3 x 3 = 9 hours.

Now, let's identify the number of hours worked during the week. He spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up. If he spends 3 hours catching up, then he works 4 times that amount, which is 4 x 3 = 12 hours.

Now, let's add the hours spent catching up with his friends and the hours worked to find the total hours spent in a week. 9 hours catching up + 12 hours working = 21 hours.

Answer: 21
