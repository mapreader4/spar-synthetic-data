Let's think step by step.

Bert had some stamps initially. Let's say the number of stamps he had before the purchase is x.

He bought 300 stamps.

To find the number of stamps Bert has after the purchase, we need to add the number of stamps he had initially to the number of stamps he bought.

The number of stamps he had initially is x.

The number of stamps he bought is 300.

So, we add the number of stamps he had to the number of stamps he bought: x + 300.

The number of stamps Bert has after the purchase is x + 300.

Answer: 300.
