Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the number of letters in Sarah's name. The name "Sarah" has 5 letters: S-A-R-A-H.

Next, we need to multiply the number of letters by twice the player's age. Sarah is 9 years old, so we multiply 5 (the number of letters) by 9 (the age).

5 * 9 = 45

So, according to the game, Sarah will get married at age 45.
