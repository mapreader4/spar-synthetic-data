Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the original amount of money Jenny had. If she had 24 dollars left after spending 3/7 of her money, that means she spent 3/7 * x = 24.

So, 3/7 * x = 24. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 7. 3/7 * 7 = 3 = x = 24 * 7 = 168/3 = 56.

So, the original amount of money Jenny had was 56 dollars.

Now, to find half of that amount, we can divide 56 by 2. 56 / 2 = 28.

Answer: 28
