Let's break it down step by step.

First, the cost of the tickets is 50 dollars each, so for 2 people, it would be 2 x 50 = 100 dollars.

Next, there is a 15% processing fee, so the total cost of the tickets becomes 1.15 x 100 = 115 dollars.

Then, there is a 10 dollar parking fee, so the total cost becomes 115 + 10 = 125 dollars.

Finally, there is an additional 5 dollar entrance fee per person, so the total cost becomes 125 + (2 x 5) = 125 + 10 = 135 dollars.

So, the total cost to go to the concert is 135 dollars.

Answer: 135
