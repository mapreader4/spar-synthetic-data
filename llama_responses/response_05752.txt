Let the number of men be x. The number of women is 2x and the number of children is 3x. The total number of people is x + 2x + 3x. Since the number of children is 30, we can set up an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 30. We can solve this equation by adding x to both sides to get 4x = 30. Since x is an integer, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get x = 15. So, there are 15 men, 30 women, and 30 children. The total number of people is 75.
