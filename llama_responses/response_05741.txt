Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first calculate the cost of the hair updo. The cost of the hair updo is $50. Let's multiply this by the tip percentage, which is 20% of 50. To calculate the tip, we multiply 50 by 0.2. 50 * 0.2 is 10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the manicure. The cost of the manicure is $30. The tip for the manicure is 20% of 30. To calculate the tip, we multiply 30 by 0.2. 30 * 0.2 is 6.

Now, let's add the cost of the hair updo and the cost of the manicure to get the total cost of the services. The total cost is 50 + 6, which is 56.

Answer: 56
