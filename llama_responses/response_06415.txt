Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of people who can fit on the raft with life jackets is x.

The problem states that if no one wears life jackets, there are 21 people who can fit on the raft. So, the maximum capacity of the raft is 21.

The problem also states that if 7 people wear life jackets, there are fewer people who can fit on the raft. This means that the number of people who can fit on the raft is 14 (21 - 7 = 14).

Now, if 8 people on the raft need life jackets, we need to subtract 8 from the 14 people who can fit on the raft. This leaves us with:

14 - 8 = 6

So, the answer is:

Answer: 6
