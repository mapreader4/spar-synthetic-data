Let's start by letting x be the number of pencils Sabrina has. Since Justin has 8 more than twice as many pencils as Sabrina, we can set up an equation.

x + 8 = 2x

We can then subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 2x - 8

Since we are told that Justin and Sabrina have 50 pencils combined, we know that:

x + 2x - 8 + 8 = 50

We can add 8 to both sides of the equation to get:

2x = 50 + 8

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation again, we get:

x = 50

So Sabrina has 50 - 8 = 42 pencils.
