Let's break down the time it takes James to download the game, install it, and go through the tutorial. 

Downloading the game takes 10 minutes. Installing it takes half that time, or 5 minutes. Going through the tutorial takes three times that amount of time, or 15 minutes. 

Adding these times together, we get 10 + 5 + 15 = 30 minutes. Therefore, James needs 30 minutes to download the game, install it, and go through the tutorial before he can play the main game.
