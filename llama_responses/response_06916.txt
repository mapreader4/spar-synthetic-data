Let the cost of the book be x. Then the marked price is 1.3x, and the sale price is 0.9(1.3x) = 1.3x - 0.1x = 1.2x.

We know that the sale price is 50. So 1.2x = 50.

We can solve for x:

1.2x = 50
x = 50 / 1.2
x = 50 / 1.2
x = 41.67

The cost of the book is 41.67. The profit is the difference between the cost and the sale price:

Profit = 50 - 41.67 = 8.33

The answer is: Answer: 8.33
