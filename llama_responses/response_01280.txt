Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Honey's daily pay is x dollars. If she earned $80 a day, then in 20 days, she earned 20 x $80 = $1600. She spent $1360, so we need to find the difference between the amount she earned and the amount she spent. This is 1600 - 1360 = 240.

So, Honey saved $240.
