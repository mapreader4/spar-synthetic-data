Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: We know that the number of onions is 985.

Step 2: We know that the number of tomatoes is 2073.

Step 3: We know that the number of cobs of corn is 4112.

Step 4: To find the total number of tomatoes and corn, we add the number of tomatoes and cobs of corn: 2073 + 4112 = 6185.

Step 5: To find the number of onions grown that is fewer than the total number of tomatoes and corn, we subtract the number of onions from the total: 985 - 6185 = -6192.

Answer: -6192
