Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The total maximum weight allowed per person is 50 pounds, and there are 6 people. So the total maximum weight for all the bags is 6 x 50 = 300 pounds.
2. The total weight of the bags is 300 pounds.
3. The total weight allowed by the airplane is 6000 pounds.
4. We can find the difference between the total weight of the bags and the total weight allowed by the airplane by subtracting the two numbers: 6000 - 300 = 5700.
5. So the airplane can hold 5700 - 300 = 5400 pounds more bags at maximum weight.

Answer: 5400
