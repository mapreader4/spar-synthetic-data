Let's break this problem down step by step.

Dr. Banks started with 330 toothbrushes.

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January, leaving him with:

330 - 53 = 277 toothbrushes

Then, he gave away 67 toothbrushes in February, leaving him with:

277 - 67 = 210 toothbrushes

Next, he gave away 46 toothbrushes in March, leaving him with:

210 - 46 = 164 toothbrushes

In April and May, he gave away half of the remaining toothbrushes each month. Half of 164 is 82, so he gave away 82 toothbrushes in April, leaving him with:

164 - 82 = 82 toothbrushes

He gave away the remaining 82 toothbrushes in May.

To find the busiest and slowest months, let's compare the number of toothbrushes given away in each month:

* January: 53
* February: 67
* March: 46
* April: 82
* May: 82

The busiest month was April and May, with 82 toothbrushes given away each. The slowest month was March, with 46 toothbrushes given away.

To find the difference, subtract the number of toothbrushes given away in March from the number of toothbrushes given away in April or May:

82 - 46 = 36

Answer: 36
