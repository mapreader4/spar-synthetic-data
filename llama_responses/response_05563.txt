Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of citations for off-leash dogs is x. Then, the number of citations for parking fines is twice the number of citations for off-leash dogs, which is 2x.

The total number of citations is the sum of the citations for off-leash dogs and the citations for parking fines, which is x + 2x.

We know that the total number of citations is 24. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 2x = 24

We can then solve for x. Subtract 2x from both sides of the equation:

x + 2x - 2x = 24 - 2x

This simplifies to:

x = 12

So, the number of citations for off-leash dogs is 12, and the number of citations for parking fines is 24 - 12 = 12. Therefore, the warden issued 12 citations for littering and 12 citations for parking fines.

Answer: 24
