Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the speeds of the cars. The blue car can travel at 80 miles per hour. The red car is twice as fast as the green car, so the green car's speed can be found by dividing the blue car's speed by 2, which is 80 รท 2 = 40 miles per hour. The green car is 8 times as fast as the blue car, so the blue car's speed is 40 รท 8 = 5 miles per hour.

Since the yellow car is broken and cannot move, we don't need to consider its speed.

Now, we need to find the red car's speed. The red car is twice as fast as the green car, which is 40 miles per hour. So, the red car's speed is 2 x 40 = 80 miles per hour.

Answer: 80
