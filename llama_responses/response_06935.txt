To find the total number of kilowatts consumed, we need to multiply the number of hours the air conditioner runs per day by the number of days it runs per day.

The air conditioner runs for 6 hours per day, and it runs for 5 days, so the total number of hours it runs is 6 * 5 = 30 hours.

The air conditioner consumes 7.2 kilowatts per hour, so the total number of kilowatts consumed is 7.2 * 30 = 216 kilowatts.
