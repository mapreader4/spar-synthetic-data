Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Tiffany needs to re-apply sunscreen every 2 hours. If she is at the beach for 16 hours, we need to find out how many times she needs to re-apply sunscreen.

To do this, we can divide 16 hours by 2 hours to get the number of times she needs to re-apply sunscreen:

16 hours รท 2 hours = 8

So, Tiffany needs to re-apply sunscreen 8 times.

Step 2: Tiffany applies 3 ounces of sunscreen each time she re-applys. To find out how many ounces she needs in total, we can multiply the number of times she re-applys by the amount of sunscreen she uses each time:

8 times x 3 ounces = 24 ounces

Step 3: Tiffany's sunscreen bottle contains 12 ounces. We need to find out how many bottles she will need.

To do this, we can divide the total amount of sunscreen she needs (24 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (12 ounces):

24 ounces รท 12 ounces = 2

So, Tiffany will need 2 bottles of sunscreen.

Step 4: Tiffany's sunscreen costs $3.5 per bottle. We need to find out how much it will cost her in total:

2 bottles x $3.5 = $7

Answer: $7
