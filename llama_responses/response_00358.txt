Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Carl has a jar full of marbles, but he takes out 12 marbles to play a game with. So, he has 12 marbles less than he had initially.

2. He accidentally drops 1/2 of the marbles he took out, which is 12/2 = 6 marbles. So, he loses 6 marbles.

3. Carl then takes out 10 more marbles. So, he now has 12 - 6 = 6 marbles left from the original 12 he took out, and he adds 10 more, making a total of 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

4. His mother brings him a bag of 25 new marbles. So, he now has 16 marbles from the original ones and 25 new ones, making a total of 16 + 25 = 41 marbles.

5. Since Carl can't find his lost marbles, he will put the 41 marbles he has now into the jar.

Answer: 41
