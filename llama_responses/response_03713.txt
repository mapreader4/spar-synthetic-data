Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the cake was cut into 12 equal pieces. This means that each piece of cake is one-twelfth the size of the whole cake.

We also know that only one-fourth of the cake was eaten by the visitors, so the amount of cake eaten is one-fourth of the total amount of cake. This is the same as one-twelfth of the cake, since there are 12 equal pieces.

So, if one-fourth of the cake was eaten, that means that the number of pieces of cake kept is 11 pieces.
