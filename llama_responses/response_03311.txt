Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be the price Porter made for his previous painting. Then, we know that he made 5 times that amount when he sold his most recent painting, which was $44,000. We can set up an equation to represent this information: 5x = 44000.

We can then solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us x = 8800.

So, Porter made $8800 for his previous painting.
