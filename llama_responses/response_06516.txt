Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many tickets Tate has. Tate has 32 tickets initially. Then, he buys 2 more tickets, so he has 32 + 2 = 34 tickets.

Now, let's find out how many tickets Peyton has. We know that Peyton has half as many tickets as Tate, so if Tate has 34 tickets, Peyton has 34 / 2 = 17 tickets.

Tate and Peyton drive together to the game. So, they have 34 + 17 = 51 tickets in total.
