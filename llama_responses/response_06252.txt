Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many times Jenny has played each of her friends. We know she's played Mark 10 times and Jill 20 times (since she's played Jill twice as many times as Mark).

Let's calculate how many times Jenny has won with Mark: 10 times. Since Mark has only won once, that means Jenny has won 9 times.

Now, let's calculate how many times Jenny has won with Jill: 20 times. Since Jill has won 75% of those 20 times, that means Jenny has won 5 times.

To find the total number of times Jenny has won, we add the number of times she's won with Mark and Jill: 9 + 5 = 14.

Answer: 14
