To solve this problem, I will first find the total weight of 7 white rhinos, which is 7 x 5100 pounds. 7 x 5100 = 35700 pounds. Then, I will find the total weight of 8 black rhinos, which is 8 x 1000 = 8000 pounds. Finally, I will add the total weight of the white and black rhinos together, which is 35700 + 8000 = 43700. Answer: 43700.
