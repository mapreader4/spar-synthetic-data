Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

The 10 fourth-graders each bought 20 pizzas. So, 10 * 8 = 80 slices are in each pizza.

Since there are 6 pieces of pizza, we can multiply the total number of slices by 6 to get the total number of slices the children are carrying.

80 * 6 = 480.

Answer: 480
