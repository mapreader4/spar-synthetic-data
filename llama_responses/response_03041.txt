Let's start by letting x be the number of miles that Wendy drove on the third day. We know that Wendy drove 125 miles on the first day and 223 miles on the second day, so the total number of miles driven is 125 + 223 = 348. The total number of miles for the trip is 493. Since Wendy drove x miles on the third day, we know that 125 + 223 + x = 493. So, x = 146. So, Wendy drove 146 miles on the third day.
