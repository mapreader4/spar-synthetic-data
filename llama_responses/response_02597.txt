Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with what we know:

* Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
* Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did.
* Jude visited half fewer rehabilitation centers as Lisa did.
* Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.

We can represent the information in variables:

* Jane: J
* Han: H
* Jude: J
* Lisa: L

From the given information, we can set up the following equations:

* J = 6 + 2*H
* H = J - 2*J
* L = J / 2

Now, we can solve for J. We can start by solving for H. We know that J = 6 + 2*H, so we can solve for H by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

J = 6 + 2*H
J - 6 = 2*H
H = J / 2
H = J / 2 - 6
H = J / 2 - 6
H = 3

Now that we have solved for H, we can substitute H into the equation for J:

J = 6 + 2*3
J = 6 + 6
J = 12

Now, we can solve for L. We know that L = J / 2, so we can solve for L by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

L = J / 2
L = 12 / 2
L = 6

So, the answer is:

Answer: 6
