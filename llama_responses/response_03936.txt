To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of women in Los Angeles. We know that half of the population is women, so we can find 6 million * 0.5 = 3 million women. Then, we know that 1/3 of the women work in retail. To find the number of women working in retail, we multiply the total number of women by 1/3, which is 3 million * 1/3 = 1 million.
