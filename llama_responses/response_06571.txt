Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many marbles each person has initially. We know that Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve, and Sally has 5 less than Sam. So, let's say Sam has x marbles. Then, Steve has x marbles.

We know that Sally has 5 less than Sam, so Sally has x - 5 marbles.

Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each. So, Sam has given away 6 marbles (3 + 3 = 6).

Now, Sam has 8 marbles left. So, Sam has 8 - 6 = 2 marbles left.

Steve has been given 3 marbles. So, Steve has 3 marbles.

Answer: 3
