Let's start by identifying the total amount of money John has in his piggy bank.

John puts $25 in his piggy bank every month, and he does this for 2 years. So, the total amount of money he puts in his piggy bank is:

25 x 12 = 300

So, John has 300 dollars in his piggy bank.

Now, he spent $400 from his piggy bank to repair his car. So, we need to subtract 400 from the total amount of money he has in his piggy bank.

300 - 400 = 200

Answer: 200
