To solve this problem, we can think of this as a work-hour problem. We know that a clerk can process 25 forms per hour. We need to find out how many hours it will take to process 2400 forms.

Let's divide 2400 by 25 to find the number of hours it will take to process 2400 forms.

2400 รท 25 = 96

So, it will take 96 hours to process 2400 forms.

In an 8-hour day, there are 8 hours. So, we need to find how many 8-hour days it will take to process 2400 forms.

96 รท 8 = 12

So, we need 12 days to process 2400 forms.

So, we need 12 clerks to process 2400 forms in 8-hour days.
