Let's break down the information into two parts: the first 4 weeks, and the second 8 weeks.

For the first 4 weeks, Jordan loses 3 pounds a week, which is 3 x 4 = 12 pounds.  After 4 weeks, he will weigh 250 - 12 = 238 pounds.

For the next 8 weeks, Jordan loses 2 pounds a week, which is 2 x 8 = 16 pounds.  After 8 weeks, he will lose 16 pounds from his weight, so his new weight will be 238 - 16 = 222 pounds.

Answer: 222
