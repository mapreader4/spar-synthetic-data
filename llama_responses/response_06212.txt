Let's start by finding the number of stuffed bears left after Daragh took out her favorite 8 bears.

Daragh had 20 stuffed bears initially, and she took out 8 of them, so the number of bears left is:

20 - 8 = 12

Now, these 12 bears are to be equally divided among Daragh's 3 sisters. To do this, we can divide 12 by 3:

12 รท 3 = 4

Since Daragh's youngest sister, Eden, already has 10 bears, she will get:

4 - 10 = 6

So, Eden now has 6 stuffed bears.
