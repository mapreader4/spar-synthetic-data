Let's break this problem down step by step.

There were 600 cookies in the box initially. Nicole ate 2/5 of the cookies. So, she ate 600 * 2/5 = 240 cookies. That leaves 600 - 240 = 360 cookies left.

Eduardo ate 3/5 of the remaining cookies. So, he ate 360 * 3/5 = 216 cookies. That leaves 360 - 216 = 144 cookies.

Now, to find the percentage of cookies that remained, we need to find the fraction of 144 out of the original 600. To do this, we can convert the fraction 144/600 to a percentage. To do that, we can divide the numerator and denominator by 600.

144 รท 600 = 0.24.

So, 0.24 is the percentage of the cookies that remained. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 24
