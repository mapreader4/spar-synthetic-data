Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of 1 artichoke. Since artichokes cost $1.25 each, we can set up an equation to represent the cost of 1 artichoke:

1 artichoke = $1.25

Since Hakeem has $15 to spend, we want to find out how many artichokes he can buy with that amount of money. We can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the artichokes:

Total cost = 1.25x

We know that it takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip, so we can set up a proportion to find the total number of artichokes Hakeem can buy:

3 artichokes = 5 ounces

We can use this proportion to find the total number of artichokes Hakeem can buy with $15:

Total artichokes = (15 / 1.25) / 3

To solve for the total number of artichokes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total artichokes = 12

So, Hakeem can buy 12 artichokes with $15. Since it takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip, we can find the total ounces of dip he can make:

Total ounces = 12 / 3
= 4
