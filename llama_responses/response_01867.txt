Let's break this down step by step.

There are 20 students in the class. One-fourth of the students stayed in the classroom, so the number of students who stayed in the classroom is 20 * 1/4 = 5. The rest of the students, which is 20 - 5 = 15, went to the playground.

Among the 15 students who went to the playground, one-third are boys. To find the number of girls, we need to find one-third of 15. One-third of 15 is 15 / 3 = 5. So, there are 5 boys on the playground.
