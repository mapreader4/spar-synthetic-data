Let's break down the problem step by step.

The problem states that the dog has 12 burrs, and six times as many ticks as burrs. We can write this as an equation: 6x = 12. We need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides by 6, which gives us x = 2. So, the dog has 2 times as many ticks as burrs. 

The problem also states that the dog has 12 burrs. So, the total number of foreign objects caught in the dog's fur is the sum of the number of burrs and the number of ticks, which is 12 + 12, which is 24.
