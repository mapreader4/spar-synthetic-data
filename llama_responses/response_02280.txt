Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Orlan had 20 meters of rope initially.
2. He gave one-fourth of the rope to Allan, so he gave 20/4 = 5 meters of rope to Allan.
3. He had 20 - 5 = 15 meters of rope left.
4. He then gave two-thirds of the remaining rope to Jack. Two-thirds of 15 is 15/3 = 5.
5. So he gave 5 meters of rope to Jack.
6. Now, Orlan has 15 - 5 = 10 meters of rope left.
