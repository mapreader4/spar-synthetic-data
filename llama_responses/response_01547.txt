Let's break this down step by step.

1. John buys bags of popcorn for $4 each. So, the cost price for 1 bag is $4.
2. John sells each bag for $8. So, the selling price for 1 bag is $8.
3. If John sells 30 bags, the total revenue will be 30 x $8 = $240.
4. To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the bags from the revenue. The cost of 30 bags is 30 x $4 = $120. So, the cost of the bags is $120.
5. The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost. So, the profit is $240 - $120 = $120.

Answer: 120
