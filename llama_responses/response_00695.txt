To find the number of 150 ml servings, we need to divide the total amount of liquid used in the smoothie by the amount of liquid in each serving.

The total amount of liquid used is 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream, which is a total of 600 ml.

The number of servings is 150 ml, so we divide 600 ml by 150 ml to get the number of servings.

600 ml รท 150 ml = 4
