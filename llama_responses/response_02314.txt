Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know: Peter weighs 65 pounds, and Tyler weighs 25 pounds more than Sam. This means that Tyler weighs 65 + 25 = 90 pounds.

We also know that Peter weighs half as much as Tyler, which means that Peter weighs half of 90 pounds. Half of 90 is 45, so Peter weighs 45 pounds.

So, Sam weighs 25 pounds less than Peter. We know that Peter weighs 45 pounds, so Sam weighs 45 - 25 = 20 pounds. 

Answer: 20
