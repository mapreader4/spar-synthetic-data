Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, the coach pours 200 milliliters of water for each of the 30 players. So, the total amount of water poured is:

30 players * 200 milliliters = 6000 milliliters

Now, 250 milliliters of water was spilled. So, we need to subtract 250 from the total amount of water poured:

6000 milliliters - 250 milliliters = 5750 milliliters

So, the amount of water left over is 5750 milliliters.

Answer: 5750
