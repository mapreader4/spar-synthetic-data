Let's start by identifying the total amount of candy Sandra had: Sandra had 2 bags with 6 pieces each, so she had 2 x 6 = 12 pieces of candy.

Roger had 2 bags, one with 11 pieces and the other with 3 pieces, so he had 11 + 3 = 14 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Roger had, we subtract Sandra's amount from Roger's amount: 14 - 12 = 2.

Answer: 2
