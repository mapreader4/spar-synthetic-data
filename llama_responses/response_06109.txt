Let's break it down step by step:

Susan bought 3 candies on Tuesday, 5 on Thursday, and 2 on Friday. That means she had a total of 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 candies. She has 4 candies left. To find out how many she ate, we can subtract the total amount of candies she had from the total amount she has: 10 - 4 = 6. So, Susan ate 6 candies.
