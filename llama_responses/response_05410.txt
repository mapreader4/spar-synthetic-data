Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The first trail is 20 miles and James can cover it at 5 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to complete the first trail, we can divide the distance by the speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 5 miles per hour
Time = 4 hours

2. The second trail is 12 miles, but James will only be able to cover 3 miles per hour and will take an hour break halfway through. Since James will have to cover the remaining 9 miles after the break, the time it takes to complete the second trail will be:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 9 miles / 3 miles per hour
Time = 3 hours

Then, James will take an hour break, so we add 1 hour to the total time:

Time = 3 hours + 1 hour
Time = 4 hours

3. To find out how many hours faster the first trail is, we subtract the time it takes to complete the second trail from the time it takes to complete the first trail:

Time difference = Time for first trail - Time for second trail
Time difference = 4 hours - 4 hours
Time difference = 0 hours

The trails are equally fast, so James will not save any time by choosing the second trail. The answer is:
