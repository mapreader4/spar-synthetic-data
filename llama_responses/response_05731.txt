Let's break this down step by step.

Marian's initial balance is $126.00.

Marian puts $60.00 worth of groceries on her card, so her new balance is $126.00 - $60.00 = $66.00.

Marian puts half of that amount, which is $30.00, in gas, so her new balance is $66.00 - $30.00 = $36.00.

Marian returns some bath towels for $45.00, so her new balance is $36.00 - $45.00 = $9.00.

So, the new balance on her credit card is $9.00.
