Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rose bushes. Bob needs to replant 20 rose bushes, each of which costs $150. So, the total cost of the rose bushes is:

20 x $150 = $3000

Next, let's calculate the cost of the gardener's labor. The gardener is paid $30 per hour, and they work for 5 hours each day for 4 days. So, the total number of hours worked is:

5 hours/day * 4 days = 20 hours

The total cost of the labor is:

20 hours * $30 per hour = $600

Now, let's calculate the cost of the soil. The cost is $5 per cubic foot, and the total amount of soil needed is:

100 cubic feet

The cost of the soil is:

100 cubic feet * $5 per cubic foot = $500

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the expenses:

$3000 (rose bushes) + $600 (labor) + $500 (soil) = $4100

Answer: 4100
