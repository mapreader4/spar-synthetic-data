Let's break down the problem step by step.

Matilda bought the smartphone for $300. Then, she decided she wouldn't use it anyway and sold it for $255.

To find the percentage of the initial cost she lost, we need to subtract the selling price from the initial cost and divide it by the initial cost.

Let's do that now:

Initial cost = $300
Selling price = $255

To find the loss, we subtract the selling price from the initial cost:

Loss = Initial cost - Selling price
= $300 - $255
= $45

Now, to find the percentage of the initial cost, we divide the loss by the initial cost:

Loss / Initial cost
= $45 รท $300
= 0.15

As a percentage, this is 15%. Therefore, Matilda lost 15% of the initial cost of the smartphone.

Answer: 15
