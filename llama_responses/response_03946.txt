Let's break this down step by step!

Initially, Mother made 2 dozen brownies, which is 2 x 12 = 24 brownies.

Father ate 8 brownies, leaving 24 - 8 = 16 brownies.

Then, Mooney ate 4 brownies, leaving 16 - 4 = 12 brownies.

The next morning, Mother made another 2 dozen brownies, which is 24 brownies. She added these to the remaining 12 brownies, making a total of:

12 + 24 = 36 brownies

So, after the addition, there were 36 brownies on the counter.

Answer: 36
