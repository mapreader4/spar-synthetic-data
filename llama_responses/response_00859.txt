Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's find out how many gummy bears are in 1 packet. There are 50 gummy bears in 1 packet.

2. Let's find out how many packets of gummy bears are needed to fill 240 packets. We need to find out how many packets of gummy bears are needed to fill 240 packets.

3. Since there are 50 gummy bears in 1 packet, we need to divide 240 by 50 to find out how many packets of gummy bears are needed. 240 divided by 50 is 4.8.

4. Since the factory produces 300 gummy bears in a minute, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to produce 240 packets. We can find out how many minutes it takes to produce 240 packets by dividing 300 by 4.8. 300 divided by 4.8 is 62.5.

Answer: 62.5
