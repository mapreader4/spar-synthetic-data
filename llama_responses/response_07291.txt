Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that a roll of 25 m wire weighs 5 kg. This means that the weight of 1 meter of wire is 0.2 kg.

Now, we need to find the weight of a 75 m roll. We can do this by multiplying the weight of 1 m wire by the number of meters. So, we have:

0.2 kg/m * 75 m =?

To find the answer, we multiply 0.2 kg by 75:

0.2 kg * 75 = 15 kg

So, the weight of a 75 m roll is 15 kg.

Answer: 15
