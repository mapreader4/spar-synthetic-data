Let's start by identifying the total amount of candy that the three friends have. Since Hugh, Tommy, and Melany have 8, 6, and 7 pounds of candy, respectively, we can add these amounts together to get the total amount of candy they have.

8 + 6 + 7 = 21

So, the total amount of candy is 21 pounds.

Next, we need to divide the total amount of candy equally among the three friends. To do this, we can divide 21 by 3.

21 รท 3 = 7

So, each person will have 7 pounds of candy.
