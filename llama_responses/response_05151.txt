Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that there were 80 cars in the parking lot initially. Then, 13 cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is 13. Then, 5 more cars went in than left. So, the number of cars that went in is 13 + 5 = 18. Since the number of cars that left is 13, we need to subtract 13 from the original number of cars to find the number of cars remaining in the parking lot. So, 80 - 13 = 67. So, there are 67 cars in the parking lot now.
