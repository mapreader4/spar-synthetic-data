Let's start by identifying the amounts spent on the items Abraham purchased.

The cost of the 4 shower gels is 4 x 4 = 16 dollars. The cost of the tube of toothpaste is 3 dollars. The total amount spent on these two items is 16 + 3 = 19 dollars. 

Abraham has 60 dollars initially, and he has 60 - 19 = 41 dollars remaining after buying these two items. 

The cost of the box of laundry detergent is 41 dollars. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 41
