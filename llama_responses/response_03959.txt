Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the cost of 1 kg of oranges is x dollars. Then, the cost of 2 kg of oranges will be 2x. And the cost of 12 kg of oranges will be 12x.

The cost of 2 kg of oranges is $6, so we can write an equation to solve for x:

2x = 6

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 6 / 2
x = 3

So, the cost of 1 kg of oranges is $3. Therefore, the cost of 12 kg of oranges will be 12 x 3 = 36.

Answer: 36
