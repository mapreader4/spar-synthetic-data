Let's break this down step by step:

Let R be Rona's age, and let C be Collete's age. We know that Rachel is twice as old as Rona, so Rachel's age is 2R.

We are given that Rona is 8 years old, so Rachel's age is 2 * 8 = 16.

We are given that Collete's age is half the age of Rona, so Collete's age is 1/2R = 1/2 * R = 4.

The difference between the age of Collete and Rachel is the difference between 4 and 16, which is 12.
