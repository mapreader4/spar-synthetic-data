Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many tokens Sandy has left after keeping half of them to herself. Half of 1 million is 0.5 million. So, Sandy will keep 0.5 million tokens to herself.

Now, let's find out how many tokens Sandy has left. 1 million - 0.5 million is 0.5 million. So, Sandy has 0.5 million tokens left.

Now, she wants to divide the remaining tokens among her 4 siblings. To do this, we need to find out how many tokens each of her siblings will get. To do this, we divide 0.5 million tokens by 4. 0.5 million / 4 = 0.125 million.

So, Sandy has 0.125 million tokens left, and each of her siblings will get 0.125 million tokens. Sandy will have 0.125 million tokens more than any of her siblings.
