Let's break this down step by step.

Rebecca bought 2 pies, each with 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.  Rebecca ate 1 slice, so there are 15 slices remaining.  Her family and friends ate 50% of the remaining pies, which is 0.5 * 15 = 7.5 slices.  On Sunday evening Rebecca and her husband each had another slice of pie, so that is 2 slices.  The total number of slices remaining is 15 - 7.5 - 2 = 5.5.
