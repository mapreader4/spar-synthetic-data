Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find MegaCorp's annual profits. The profit from mining is $3,000,000 and the profit from oil refining is $5,000,000. The total profit is the sum of these two, so:

Profit = $3,000,000 + $5,000,000 = $8,000,000

Next, we need to find 1% of this profit. To find 1% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.01.

1% = 0.01

So, 0.01 x $8,000,000 = $80,000

So, the fine is $80,000.

Answer: 80000
