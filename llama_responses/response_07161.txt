Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Kenny played basketball last week. We also know that he practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he played basketball. We also know that he practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours.

Let's say the number of hours Kenny played basketball is x.

Since he practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he played basketball, we can set up an equation to represent this information. We can say that the number of hours Kenny played basketball is equal to the number of hours he practiced on the trumpet, which is 40 hours.

So, we can set up the equation as 2x = 40. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

x = 40 / 2
x = 20

Answer: 20
