Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. There are 90 students who have lunch during period 5.
2. Two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, which means that 2/3 * 90 = 60 students are in the cafeteria.
3. The remainder of the students, which is 90 - 60 = 30, sat at the covered picnic tables outside.
4. Then, one-third of the students outside, which is 1/3 * 30 = 10, jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria.
5. At the same time, 3 students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about.
6. So, the number of students in the cafeteria has changed. We need to subtract the 3 students who went outside from the original 60 students in the cafeteria. 60 - 3 = 57 students are in the cafeteria now.

Answer: 57
