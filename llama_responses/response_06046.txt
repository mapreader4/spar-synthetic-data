Let's break it down step by step.

Ellen's daily calorie goal is 2,200 calories. She ate 353 calories for breakfast. So, we subtract 353 from 2,200 to get the remaining calories for the day.

2,200 - 353 = 1,847

For lunch, she ate 885 calories. So, we subtract 885 from the remaining calories.

1,847 - 885 = 962

She had an afternoon snack of 130 calories. We subtract 130 from the remaining calories.

962 - 130 = 832

So, Ellen has 832 calories left for dinner.
