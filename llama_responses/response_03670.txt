Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, Erika and her 3 siblings have some number of pieces of chalk. Let's call this number x.

When the 3 friends join, the total number of people drawing with chalk is now 7 (Erika and her 4 siblings, plus the 3 friends).

Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk while they're counting, so the total number of pieces of chalk available is now x - 2.

Since there isn't enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each, we can set up an equation:

7 people * 3 pieces per person = total pieces of chalk available

3 * 7 = 21

So, the total number of pieces of chalk available is 21.

However, we know that the total number of pieces of chalk available is actually x - 2, since Erika lost 2 pieces. We can set up an equation:

x - 2 = 21

To solve for x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation:

x = 23

So, Erika and her siblings originally had 23 pieces of chalk.

Answer: 23
