Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how much Doris earns per week. She earns $20 per hour and she works for 8 hours a week (3 hours 5 days a week). So, her weekly earnings are:

$20 * 8 = $160

Since she needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses, let's find out how many weeks it takes to earn that amount. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Let's divide both sides by $1200 by $160 to get the number of weeks:

$1200 รท $160 = 7.5

So, it takes Doris 7.5 weeks to earn enough money to cover her monthly expenses.
