Let's break this down step by step:

Let's first find the total number of people visited by the amusement park in a week. There were 100 people visited on Monday to Friday, which is 5 days, so 5 x 100 = 500 people. Then, on Saturday and Sunday, 200 + 300 = 500 people visited. So the total number of people visited is 500 + 500 = 1000.

The amusement park sells tickets for $3 each. So the total amount of money made is 1000 x 3 = 3000.
