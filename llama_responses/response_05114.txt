Let's break this problem down step by step.

Jaron has already sold 8 chocolate bunnies that are worth 100 points each. This means he has 8 * 100 = 800 points. He needs 2000 points to win the Nintendo Switch, so he is currently 2000 - 800 = 1200 points short. Each Snickers bar earns 25 points, so to find out how many Snickers bars he needs to sell, we can divide the remaining points by 25.

2000 - 800 = 1200, divided by 25 = 48.

Answer: 48
