Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Kiki has $90.
* She buys twice as many hats as scarves.
* She spends 60% of her money on hats.
* The rest of her money is spent on scarves.

Let's use the information to set up an equation to solve the problem.

Let x be the number of scarves she buys. Then, we know that the number of hats is twice the number of scarves, so we can write an equation to represent the situation:

2x = x

We know that Kiki spends 60% of her money on hats, so we can set up an equation to represent the amount of money spent on hats:

0.6x = 60

We are told that Kiki has $90, so we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money she has:

90 = 0.6x + x

To solve for the number of scarves, we can subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation to get:

90 - 0.6x = x

We can then solve for x:

x = 90 - 0.6x
x = 30

Since x is the number of scarves, we can round it to the nearest whole number:

x = 30

So, Kiki will buy 30 scarves.
