Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of balls removed by the 3 students: 3 students removed 8 balls each, so the total number of balls removed by the 3 students is 3 x 8 = 24.

Since the total number of balls remaining is 56, and the 3 students removed 24 balls, the number of balls remaining in the baskets is 56 - 24 = 32.

The other 2 students removed an equal number of balls each. Let's call this number x. Then, the equation becomes:

x + x = 32

To solve for x, we can subtract 32 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 32

So, the other 2 students each removed 16 balls.
