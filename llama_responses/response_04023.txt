Let's think step by step.

Let's start by determining how many slices of banana each yogurt will need.

Each yogurt is topped with 8 banana slices.  One banana will yield 10 slices.  So, each yogurt will need 10/8 = 1.25 bananas.

Since we need to make 5 yogurts, we need to multiply the number of bananas per yogurt by 5.

1.25 * 5 = 6.25

So, Vivian needs to buy 6.25 bananas.
