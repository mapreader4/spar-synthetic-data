Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the food:

Salmon: $40
Black burger: $15
Chicken katsu: $25
Total food cost: $40 + $15 + $25 = $80

Next, we need to add the 10% service charge:

$80 x 0.10 = $8
Total cost with service charge: $80 + $8 = $88

Finally, we need to add the 5% tip:

$88 x 0.05 = $4.40
Total cost with tip: $88 + $4.40 = $92.40

Mr. Arevalo pays with $100. To find out how much change he will receive, we subtract the total cost from the $100:

$100 - $92.40 = $7.60
