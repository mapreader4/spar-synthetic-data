Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of hens is x.

The statement says that the farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters. We can represent this as the equation:

5 < 9x

This equation is saying that the number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

9x - 5 = 0

This gives us:

x = 5

So, the number of hens is 5.

Answer: 5
