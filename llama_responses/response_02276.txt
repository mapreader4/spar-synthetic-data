Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Billy reduces 6 quarts of juice to 1/12 of its original volume. So, we need to find 1/12 of 6 quarts. To do this, we can divide 6 by 12, which gives us 1/2 quart.

So, 1/2 quart is equal to 2 cups.

2. Then, Billy adds 1 cup of sugar. Since there are 4 cups in a quart, 1 cup is 1/4 of a quart. So, the total volume of the syrup is 2 cups (from the reduced juice) + 1 cup (the sugar) = 3 cups.
