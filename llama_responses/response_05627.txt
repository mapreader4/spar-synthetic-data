Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Genevieve has written 4300 lines of code.
2. She debugs every 100 lines of code.
3. Each debugging session finds 3 errors.
4. Genevieve fixes each error.

To find the total number of errors fixed, we can multiply the number of errors found in each debugging session by the number of debugging sessions.

Number of debugging sessions = 4300 lines of code / 100 lines per session = 43
Number of errors per debugging session = 3
Total number of errors fixed = 43 * 3 = 129

Answer: 129
