Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the entree costs x dollars.

The dessert costs y dollars.

The total cost is 23 dollars.

We know that the entree costs 5 dollars more than the dessert. So, the equation we have is:

x + y = 23

The dessert cost y dollars. So, we know that y = 23 - x.

So, we can write the equation as:

x + (23 - x) = x.

We can subtract x from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 23 - x.

So, the entree costs 11 dollars.
