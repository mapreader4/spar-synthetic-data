Let's break this problem down step by step.

Cersei started with 50 cotton candies. She gave her brother and sister 5 each, so she gave away 10 cotton candies in total.

Then, she gave one-fourth of the remaining cotton candies to her cousin. To find one-fourth of the remaining cotton candies, we can multiply 40 (the remaining cotton candies) by one-fourth, which is 10.

So, she gave 10 cotton candies to her cousin.

Now, she ate 12 cotton candies.

To find the remaining cotton candies, we subtract the 12 cotton candies she ate from the 30 cotton candies she had left after giving 10 away:

30 - 12 = 18

So, the number of cotton candies left is 18.

Answer: 18
