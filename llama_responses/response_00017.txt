Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's start by identifying the initial number of hard hats:

* Pink hard hats: 26
* Green hard hats: 15
* Yellow hard hats: 24

Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, so the new number of pink hard hats is:
26 - 4 = 22

John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed, which is 6 * 2 = 12. So, John takes away 6 pink hard hats and 12 green hard hats. The number of green hard hats John takes is 12, and the number of pink hard hats he takes is 6.

So, the new number of green hard hats is:
15 - 12 = 3

The new number of pink hard hats is:
22 - 6 = 16

The new total number of hard hats in the truck is:
22 (pink) + 3 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 49

Answer: 49
