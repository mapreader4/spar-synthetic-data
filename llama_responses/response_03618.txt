Let's break it down step by step.

Maurice gets $2 for every task, so for 30 tasks, he would get 30 x $2 = $60.

For every 10 tasks, he gets a $6 bonus, so for 3 sets of 10 tasks, he would get 3 x $6 = $18.

So, the total amount Maurice would get for finishing 30 tasks would be $60 + $18 = $78.
