Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Collin has 25 flowers initially.
2. Ingrid gives Collin a third of her 33 flowers. To find a third of 33, we can divide 33 by 3, which is 11.
3. Each flower has 4 petals.
4. So, Collin gets 11 flowers from Ingrid.
5. Collin has 25 flowers initially, and he gets 11 more flowers from Ingrid.
6. Therefore, Collin has 25 + 11 = 36 flowers in total.

Answer: 36
