Let's break down the information given in the question:

* John has 20% more boxes than Jules.
* Jules has 5 more boxes than Joseph.
* Joseph has 80% fewer boxes than Stan.
* Stan has 100 boxes.

From the first statement, we know that John has 20% more boxes than Jules. 20% of 100 (which is the number of boxes Stan has) is 20. So John has 100 - 20 = 80 boxes.

Answer: 80
