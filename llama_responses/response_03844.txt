Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of steak knives Elizabeth wants to buy. She wants to buy 2 sets of steak knives, and each set contains 4 steak knives, so the total number of steak knives she wants to buy is 2 * 4 = 8 steak knives.

Next, let's find the cost of each steak knife. Elizabeth buys 2 sets of steak knives and each set costs $80.00. So, to find the cost of each steak knife, we need to divide the total cost by the number of steak knives.

The total cost is $80.00 and the number of steak knives is 8. To find the cost of each steak knife, we divide 80.00 by 8.

80.00 รท 8 = 10.00

Answer: 10
