Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Grace earned from mowing lawns. She mowed lawns for 63 hours at $6 an hour, so the total amount of money earned from mowing lawns is:

63 hours * $6 per hour = $378

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Grace earned from pulling weeds. She pulled weeds for 9 hours at $11 per hour, so the total amount of money earned from pulling weeds is:

9 hours * $11 per hour = $99

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Grace earned from putting down mulch. She put down mulch for 10 hours at $9 per hour, so the total amount of money earned from putting down mulch is:

10 hours * $9 per hour = $90

To find the total amount of money Grace earned in September, we add up the amounts earned from mowing lawns, pulling weeds, and putting down mulch:

$378 + $99 + $90 = $567

Answer: 567
