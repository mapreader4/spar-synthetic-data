Let's break this down step by step.

Paul earns $12.50 for each hour he works, so he earns a total of 40 * 12.50 = $500 for 40 hours of work.

After paying 20% of his paycheck for taxes and fees, Paul will pay 0.20 * 500 = $100 for taxes and fees. So, his new total amount of money is 500 - 100 = $400.

Paul then spends 15% of his paycheck on gummy bears, which is 0.15 * 400 = $60. So, he has 400 - 60 = $340 left.

Answer: 340
