Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total length of the path that needs to be lined with fence. The path is 900 feet long, but there is a 42-foot bridge, so the total length that needs to be lined with fence is 900 - 42 = 858 feet.

Since a fence pole is placed every 6 feet, we need to find how many 6-foot sections of fence it takes to make up the 858 feet. To do this, we can divide 858 by 6:

858 รท 6 = 143

So, 143 fence poles will be placed along the path on both sides.
