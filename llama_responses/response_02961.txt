Let's think step by step.

Let's say the number of pages of the shortest book is x.

Since the book in the middle of her shelf has three times the number of pages of the shortest book, it means that the middle book has 3x pages.

The longest book has 396 pages, so the middle book has 3x pages, where x is the number of pages of the shortest book.

We know that the shortest book has one-fourth of the number of pages of the longest book. So, we can say that x is 1/4 of 396, or 99.

The middle book has 3x pages, so 3x = 3 * 99 = 297.

Answer: 297
