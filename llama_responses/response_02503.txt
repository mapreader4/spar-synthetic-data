Let's break it down step by step:

Alden has 50 nephews 10 years ago. This is half the number of nephews Alden has now. So, the number of nephews Alden has now is 50 x 2 = 100.

Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden now. So, the total number of nephews the two have is 100 + 60 = 160.

Answer: 160
