Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the average score of the 9 students who have already taken the test is x. Since the 5 students who scored 92 and 4 students who scored 80, the total score of these 9 students is 5 * 92 + 4 * 80 = 460.

The total score of the 10 students in the class is the sum of the scores of all 10 students, which is the sum of the scores of the 9 students who have already taken the test and the score of the last student. So, the total score of the 10 students is 460 + x.

Since the class average test score should be at least 85, we can set up an equation to represent this:

460 + x / 10 = 85

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 10:

x = 850 - 460 = 85 * 10

x = 390

So, the last student would need to score 90 to make the teacher happy.
