Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the given information:

* 30 students raised $20 each
* 10 students raised $20 each
* The rest of the students (20 - 10 = 20) raised $30 each

The total amount of money raised by the students who raised $20 each is:
20 x 10 = 200

The total amount of money raised by the rest of the students is:
20 x 10 = 200

The total amount of money raised in all is:
200 + 200 = 400
