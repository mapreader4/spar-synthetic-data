Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Mary's brother is 180 cm tall, and Mary is 2/3 the height of her brother. This means that Mary's height is 2/3 * 180 = 120 cm.

To find out how many more centimeters Mary needs to grow to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract Mary's current height from the minimum height required to ride the roller coaster. This is 140 cm. We can do this by subtracting 120 (Mary's height) from 140:

140 - 120 = 20

So, Mary needs to grow 20 cm to ride the Kingda Ka roller coaster.
