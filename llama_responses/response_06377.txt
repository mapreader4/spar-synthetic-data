Let's break this problem down step by step.

Magdalena picked 1/5 of the apples on the first day, which is:

200 * (1/5) = 40 apples

On the second day, she picked twice that number, which is:

40 * 2 = 80 apples

On the third day, she picked 20 more apples than on the first day, which is:

40 + 20 = 60 apples

So, in total, Magdalena picked:

40 + 80 + 60 = 180 apples

Since the tree originally had 200 apples, we subtract the total number of apples picked from the original amount:

200 - 180 = 20

Answer: 20
