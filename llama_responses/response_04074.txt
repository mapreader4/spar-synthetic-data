Let's break it down step by step.

Mr. Doré bought 140 worth of pants. So, the cost of the pants is 140 dollars.

Mr. Doré bought a 43 dollar shirt. So, the cost of the shirt is 43 dollars.

Mr. Doré bought a 15 dollar tie. So, the cost of the tie is 15 dollars.

So, the total cost of the items is 140 + 43 + 15 dollars. That is, 198 dollars.

Mr. Doré pays with a 200 dollar bill. So, he pays 200 dollars.

The change the saleswoman will give him back is 200 - 198 dollars. That is, 2 dollars.
