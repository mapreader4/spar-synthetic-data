Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that there are 26 boxes in the attic. 6 of these boxes contain pans, so we subtract 6 from 26 to get:

26 - 6 = 20

This means that there are 20 boxes left that contain either decorations or teacups.

Next, we know that half of the remaining boxes contain decorations. Half of 20 is 10, so:

10 boxes contain decorations

This leaves:

20 - 10 = 10

boxes that contain teacups.

Now, we know that each box contains 5 rows of 4 cups, for a total of:

5 rows x 4 cups/row = 20 cups

per box. Since there are 10 boxes that contain teacups, the total number of cups is:

10 boxes x 20 cups/box = 200 cups

However, Samuel breaks 2 cups every time he picks up a box. Since he has to pick up all 10 boxes, he breaks:

10 boxes x 2 cups/box = 20 cups

So, the total number of cups left is:

200 cups - 20 cups = 180 cups

Answer: 180
