Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's start by finding out how long dogs live. Since dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters live, and hamsters live an average of 2.5 years, we can multiply 2.5 by 4 to find the average life span of dogs. 2.5 * 4 = 10.

2. Now, we know that well-cared fish can live 2 years longer than dogs. So, if dogs live 10 years, fish live 12 years.

3. Since fish live 12 years, we can answer the question: "How long can a fish live?" Answer: 12
