Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The teacher needs to buy a bow for each of the 23 students. The cost of a bow is $5, so the total cost of the bows is 23 x $5 = $115.
2. The teacher also needs a bottle of vinegar for each student. The cost of a bottle of vinegar is $2, so the total cost of the vinegar is 23 x $2 = $46.
3. The teacher also needs a box of baking soda for each student. The cost of a box of baking soda is $1, so the total cost of the baking soda is 23 x $1 = $23.
4. To find the total cost of all the supplies, we need to add the cost of the bows, vinegar, and baking soda: $115 + $46 + $23 = $184.

Answer: 184
