Let's break it down step by step.

1. Tom weighs 150 kg, and he is holding 1.5 times his weight in each hand, which is 1.5 x 150 = 225 kg. He is wearing a weight vest that weighs half his weight, which is 0.5 x 150 = 75 kg.

So, he is moving with a total weight of 225 + 75 = 300 kg.

Answer: 300
