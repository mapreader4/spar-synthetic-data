Let's start by finding out how old Arman's sister is today. If his sister is 2 years old four years ago, that means his sister is 2 + 4 = 6 years old today. Since Arman is 6 years older than his sister, that means Arman is 6 + 6 = 12 years old today. In 40 years, Arman will be 12 + 40 = 52 years old.
