Let's break this down step by step.

On Friday, Hank started with an unknown number of bicycles. He sold 10 bicycles, so he had fewer bicycles. Then, he bought 15 more, so now he has more bicycles.

On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles, so he had fewer bicycles. Then, he bought 8 more, so now he has more bicycles.

On Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles, so he had fewer bicycles. Then, he bought 11 more, so now he has more bicycles.

To find the net increase, we need to add up the number of bicycles he bought and subtract the number he sold. Let's do that:

Friday: -10 (bicycles sold) + 15 (bicycles bought) = 5
Saturday: -12 (bicycles sold) + 8 (bicycles bought) = -4
Sunday: -9 (bicycles sold) + 11 (bicycles bought) = 2

Adding these up, we get:
5 - 4 + 2 = 3

So, the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock over the three days is 3.
