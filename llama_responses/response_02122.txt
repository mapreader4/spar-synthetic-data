Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the salon has x customers every day. Each customer needs 1 can of hairspray for the styling and 1 can of hairspray for take-home. So, the total hairspray needed for the customers is 2 cans each. The salon also buys 5 cans of hairspray each day for extra. So, the total hairspray bought each day is 5 cans. 

So, the total hairspray bought each day is 5 + 2 = 7 cans. 

So, we can say that the salon buys 7 cans of hairspray each day.
