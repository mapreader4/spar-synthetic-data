Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find out how many ounces of shampoo his dad has used in 4 days. Since his dad uses 1 oz of shampoo a day, he has used 4 oz of shampoo in 4 days.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many ounces of hot sauce Adonis has added in 4 days. Adonis adds 1/2 oz of hot sauce every day, so in 4 days, he has added 2 oz of hot sauce.

Step 3: Now, let's find the total amount of liquid in the bottle after 4 days. The bottle has 10 oz of shampoo and 2 oz of hot sauce. So, the total amount of liquid is 12 oz.

Step 4: To find the percentage of hot sauce in the bottle, we need to find the fraction of 2 oz out of the total 12 oz. We can do this by dividing 2 by 12.

2 รท 12 = 1/6

Answer: 1/6 or 16.67%
