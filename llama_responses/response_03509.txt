Let's break this down step by step.

Scott runs 3 miles every Monday through Wednesday. So, he runs 3 miles on Monday, 3 miles on Tuesday, and 3 miles on Wednesday.

He runs twice as far he ran on Monday every Thursday and Friday. So, he runs 2 x 3 = 6 miles on Thursday and 2 x 3 = 6 miles on Friday.

To find the total number of miles Scott runs in a month with 4 weeks, we need to multiply the total miles he runs each week by the number of weeks.

In a week, Scott runs 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 18 miles.

In a month with 4 weeks, Scott will run 18 x 4 = 72 miles.
