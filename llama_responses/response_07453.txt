To find the number of friends on the combined list, we need to add the number of friends that James has to the number of friends that John has. James has 75 friends. John has 3 times as many friends as James, so John has 3 * 75 = 225 friends. 75 + 225 = 300. They share 25 friends. To find the total number of friends on the combined list, we subtract the number of friends they share from the total, so we have 300 - 25 = 275 friends on the combined list.
