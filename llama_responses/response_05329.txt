Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of white flowers is x.

We know that the total number of flowers is 42.

We also know that a third of the flowers are pink, and two are red. So, the number of pink flowers is 1/3 * 42 = 14.

We also know that the total number of flowers is the sum of the number of pink flowers, red flowers, and white flowers. So, we can set up the equation: 14 + red flowers + x = 42.

We know that the number of red flowers is 2, since 2 are red. So, we can substitute this into the equation: 14 + 2 = x.

To solve for x, we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: x = 16.

Answer: 16
