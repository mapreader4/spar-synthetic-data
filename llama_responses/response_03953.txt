Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of goals scored by each player is x.

Since the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, we can set up an equation:

x + x = 300

We know that the number of goals scored by the two players accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. To find the total number of goals scored by the two players, we can multiply the total number of goals by 0.2:

0.2 * 300 = 60

Since the number of goals scored by each player is equal, we can divide the total number of goals scored by 2:

60 รท 2 = 30

So, each player scored 30 goals.

Answer: 30
