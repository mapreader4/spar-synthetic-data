Let's first find out how many shells Jacob found. Since Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed did, and Ed found 2 shells initially, Jacob must have found 2 + 2 = 4 shells. So, Ed found 2 shells, and Jacob found 4 shells. In total, they have 2 + 4 = 6 shells. Then, Ed and Jacob found 7 limpet shells and 2 oyster shells, which is 7 + 2 = 9. Then, they found 4 conch shells. So, in total, they found 9 + 6 = 15 shells. Therefore, Ed and Jacob have 15 shells altogether.
