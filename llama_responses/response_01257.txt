Let's break down the problem step by step.

Alice puts all of her $2000 in the stock market, which means she has $2000.

Bob invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. Since he invested $2000, he must have made $10,000 in real estate. $10,000 is five times more than $2000, which means he made $2000 + $6000.

To find out how much money Bob has now, we need to add the amount he made from his investment to the amount he started with. So, $2000 + $6000 = $8000.

Therefore, Bob has $8000. Since Alice has $2000, Bob has $6000 more than Alice.

Answer: 6000.
