Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many commencement addresses Governor Sandoval gave. We know that Governor Sandoval gave 12 addresses.

Next, we know that Governor Hawkins gave twice as many addresses as Governor Sandoval. So, Governor Hawkins gave 12 * 2 = 24 addresses.

Finally, we know that Governor Sloan gave 10 more addresses than Governor Sandoval. So, Governor Sloan gave 12 + 10 = 22 addresses.

To find the total number of addresses given by the three of them, we add the number of addresses given by each of them:

12 (Sandoval) + 24 (Hawkins) + 22 (Sloan) = 58

Answer: 58
