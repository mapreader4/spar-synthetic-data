Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate how many pages Rene can finish reading in 60 minutes. We know Rene can read 30 pages in 60 minutes. So, in 240 minutes, Rene can read 30 * 4 = 120 pages.

Now, let's calculate how many pages Lulu can finish reading in 60 minutes. We know Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes. So, in 240 minutes, Lulu can read 27 * 4 = 108 pages.

Finally, let's calculate how many pages Cherry can finish reading in 60 minutes. We know Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes. So, in 240 minutes, Cherry can read 25 * 4 = 100 pages.

Now, let's add up the number of pages each of them can finish reading in 240 minutes.

Rene can read 120 pages, Lulu can read 108 pages, and Cherry can read 100 pages. 120 + 108 + 100 = 328.

Answer: 328
