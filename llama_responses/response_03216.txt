Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Last year, Kyle picked a dozen roses. A dozen is equal to 12, so Kyle picked 12 roses.
2. This year, Kyle was only able to pick half the number of roses, which is half of 12, which is 6.
3. Kyle wants to give his mother a bouquet with twice as many roses as last year, which is 2 x 12 = 24 roses.
4. Since Kyle wants to give his mother 24 roses, and each rose costs $3, the total cost of the roses would be 24 x $3 = $72.

Answer: $72
