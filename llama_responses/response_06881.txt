To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of questions. We know that 80% of the 50 questions are problem-solving questions, so we need to find 80% of 50.

To find 80% of 50, we can multiply 50 by 0.8. This gives us:

50 * 0.8 = 40

Now, we know that the 40 questions are problem-solving questions. To find the number of multiple-choice questions, we subtract 40 from the total number of questions, 50. This gives us:

50 - 40 = 10

Answer: 10
