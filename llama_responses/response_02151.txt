Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Charley had 30 pencils initially.
2. She lost 6 pencils. So, we subtract 6 from 30 to get 24 pencils.
3. Then, she lost 1/3 of the remaining pencils. To find this out, we need to multiply 24 by 1/3, which is the same as multiplying 24 by 0.33. This gives us 8 pencils.
4. So, we subtract 8 from 24 to get 16 pencils.

Answer: 16
