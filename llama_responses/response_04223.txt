To find the average cost of each piece of fruit, we can add up the total cost of all the fruit and then divide that by the total number of fruits.

The total cost of the apples is 12 x $2 = $24.
The total cost of the bananas is 4 x $1 = $4.
The total cost of the oranges is 4 x $3 = $12.

The total cost of all the fruit is $24 + $4 + $12 = $40.

There are 12 apples, 4 bananas, and 4 oranges, which is a total of 20 fruits.

So, the average cost of each piece of fruit is $40 divided by 20, which is $2.
