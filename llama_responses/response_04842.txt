Let's break down the cost of the fruits:

Lemons: 6 * 2 = 12
Papayas: 4 * 1 = 4
Mangos: 2 * 4 = 8

Total cost before discount: 12 + 4 + 8 = 24

The store offers a $1 discount for every 4 fruits. Since Tom bought 12 fruits in total, he will get a discount of 3 times $1, which is 3 * 1 = 3.

So, the total cost will be 24 - 3 = 21.

Answer: 21
