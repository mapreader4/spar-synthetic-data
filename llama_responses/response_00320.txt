Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Austin bought 7 friends each a robot.
* Each robot costs $8.75.
* He was charged $7.22 for tax.
* He left with $11.53 in change.

Let's represent the total cost of the robots as 7 * 8.75 = 61.25.
Then, let's subtract the tax from the total cost to find the amount Austin started with:
61.25 - 7.22 = 54.03

So, Austin started with $54.03.
