Let's break down the problem step by step.

Whitney has 2 x $20 = $40.

She buys 2 posters, which cost $5 each. So, 2 x $5 = $10.

She buys 3 notebooks, which cost $4 each. So, 3 x $4 = $12.

She buys 2 bookmarks, which cost $2 each. So, 2 x $2 = $4.

Total cost of the items purchased = $10 + $12 + $4 = $26.

Whitney has spent a total of $26. She has $40 - $26 = $14 left over.
