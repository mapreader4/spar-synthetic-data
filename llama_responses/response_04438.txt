Let's break down the time Paris studies during the weekdays and weekends.

During the weekdays, Paris studies 3 hours a day for her classes. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so she studies 5 * 3 = 15 hours during the weekdays.

On the weekends, Paris studies 4 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. The total time she studies on the weekends is 4 + 5 = 9 hours.

The total time Paris studies during the semester is the time she studies during the weekdays plus the time she studies during the weekends. So, the total time is 15 + 9 = 24 hours.
