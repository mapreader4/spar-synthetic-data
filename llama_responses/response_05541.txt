Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that each child's ticket is $7. Let's let x be the cost of each adult's ticket.

The total cost of the trip is $76. The cost of the trip is the cost of the tickets plus the cost of the concessions. Let's represent the cost of the concessions as c.

The equation for this situation is:

7(2) + x + c = 76

The cost of the concessions is $12, so we know that 7(2) + x + 12 = 76. We can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to get:

7(2) + x = 64

We know that 7(2) is 14, so we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 64 - 14

x = 50

So, the cost of each adult's ticket is $50.
