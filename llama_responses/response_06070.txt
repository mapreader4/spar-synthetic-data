Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the four pizzas. The pizzas cost $80, so we can set that equal to 4x, or 4p, where p is the cost of one pizza. 

Next, we know that the pizzas were cut into 5 pieces each, so we can set up an equation to find the cost of one piece of pizza. 80 = 4p * 5, so we can solve for p.

To solve for p, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us p = 80/5. 80/5 = 16.

Answer: 16
