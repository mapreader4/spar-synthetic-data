Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Jean eats one donut per 2 pages.
* She writes 12 pages.

We can find the total number of donuts she eats by multiplying the number of pages she writes by the number of donuts per page. We know that 12 pages / 2 donuts per page = 6 donuts.

Then, we know that each donut has 150 calories. So, the total number of calories she eats is:

6 donuts * 150 calories per donut = 900 calories.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 900
