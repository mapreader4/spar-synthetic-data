Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. So, on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, she jogs for 30 minutes each.
2. On Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more. So, on Tuesday, she jogged 30 minutes + 5 minutes = 35 minutes.
3. On Friday, she jogged 25 minutes more. So, on Friday, she jogged 30 minutes + 25 minutes = 55 minutes.
4. To find the total time Ayen jogged this week, we add the minutes she jogged each day. 35 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 35 + 55 = 150.

Answer: 150
