Let's break this down step by step:

Jessy has 10 necklaces initially. She buys 10 more, so now she has 10 + 10 = 20 necklaces.

She had 15 earrings initially, and buys 2/3 as many as before, which is 15 x 2/3 = 10 earrings. So, she now has 15 + 10 = 25 earrings.

After that, her mother gives her 1/5 times more earrings than the number she purchased at the store. She purchased 10 earrings, so 1/5 of that is 10 x 1/5 = 2 earrings. So, her total number of earrings becomes 25 + 2 = 27 earrings.

Now, let's add the total number of necklaces and earrings: 20 necklaces + 27 earrings = 47 jewelry pieces.

Answer: 47
