Let's start by finding the total weight of the trout. The trout weigh 2 pounds each, and she caught 4 of them, so the total weight of the trout is 4 x 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, the catfish weigh 1.5 pounds each, and she caught 3 of them, so the total weight of the catfish is 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 pounds.

The bluegills weigh 2.5 pounds each, and she caught 5 of them, so the total weight of the bluegills is 5 x 2.5 = 12.5 pounds.

To find the total weight of all the fish, we add the weight of the trout, catfish, and bluegills together: 8 + 4.5 + 12.5 = 24.5 pounds.

Answer: 24.5
