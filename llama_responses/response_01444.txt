Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with what we know: Emily has 20 credits.

Since Aria has twice as many credits as Emily, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Aria's credits = 2 * Emily's credits

We know Emily has 20 credits, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Aria's credits = 2 * 20

To solve for Aria's credits, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Aria's credits = 2 * 20
Aria's credits = 40

So, the total number of high school credits the three have is 40.
