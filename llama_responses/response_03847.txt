Let's break this down step by step.

There are 24 people named Barry, and all of them are nice, so 24 people are nice.

There are 20 people named Kevin, and half of them are nice. So, 20 / 2 = 10 people named Kevin are nice.

There are 80 people named Julie, and three-fourths of them are nice. So, 80 * 3/4 = 60 people named Julie are nice.

There are 50 people named Joe, and 10% of them are nice. So, 50 * 0.1 = 5 people named Joe are nice.

Adding up the number of nice people, we get: 24 + 10 + 60 + 5 = 99 people are nice.

Answer: 99
