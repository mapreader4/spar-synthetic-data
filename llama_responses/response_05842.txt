Let's break it down step by step.

James started with 150 subscribers. Then, someone gifted 50 subscribers to him. So, the total number of subscribers is now 150 + 50 = 200.

Since he gets $9 per subscriber, we can multiply the total number of subscribers by the amount he gets per subscriber to find the total amount of money he makes per month.

200 subscribers * $9 per subscriber = 200 * 9 = 1800

Answer: 1800
