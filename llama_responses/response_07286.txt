Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the variables.

Let's say Patrick has x hours left to finish his homework. We know that he has 4 hours less than twice the amount of time that Greg has left to finish his homework. So, we can set up an equation:

x - 2 * (Greg's time) = 4

Since we know that Greg has 6 hours less than Jacob, we can write:

Greg's time = Jacob's time - 6

So, we can substitute this into the equation:

x - 2 * (Jacob's time - 6) = 4

We know that Jacob has 18 hours left to finish his homework. So, we can substitute this in:

x - 2 * (18 - 6) = 4

Simplifying the equation:

x - 2 * 12 = 4

x - 24 = 4

Add 24 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28

So, Patrick has 28 hours left to finish his homework.

To find the total number of hours they all have left to finish their homework, we need to add the hours left for Patrick, Greg, and Jacob:

Patrick: 28
Greg: Jacob: 18
Total: 28 + 18 = 46

Answer: 46
