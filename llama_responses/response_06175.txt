Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of goals scored by Layla and Kristin.

Layla scored 104 goals in 4 games, so the total number of goals scored by Layla is 104.

Kristin scored 24 goals in 4 games, so the total number of goals scored by Kristin is 24.

Now, to find the average number of goals they scored, we need to add the total number of goals scored by both Layla and Kristin and then divide by 2.

The total number of goals scored by Layla and Kristin is 104 + 24 = 128.

Now, we divide the total number of goals scored by 2.

128 รท 2 = 64

Answer: 64
