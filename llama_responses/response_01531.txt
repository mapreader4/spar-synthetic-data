Let's break down the time it took to achieve each goal:

1. Getting in shape: 2 years
2. Learning to be a technically proficient mountain climber: 2 x 2 years = 4 years
3. Climbing the 7 summits: 7 x 5 months = 35 months = 2.92 years (round up to 3 years since we can't have a fraction of a year)
4. Learning to dive: 13 months
5. Diving through all the caves: 2 years

Adding up the time it took to achieve each goal, we get:

2 years + 4 years + 3 years + 13 months + 2 years = 13 years + 13 months

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up the 13 months to 1 year, making the total time it took to achieve all the goals:
