Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. First, let's find the cost of the total amount of money the store earned from the cola. Since the store sold 15 bottles of cola, and each bottle costs $3, the total amount of money earned from cola is 15 x 3 = 45.

2. Next, let's find the cost of the total amount of money the store earned from the juice. Since the store sold 12 bottles of juice, and each bottle costs $1.5, the total amount of money earned from juice is 12 x 1.5 = 18.

3. Finally, let's find the cost of the total amount of money the store earned from the water. Since the store sold 25 bottles of water, and each bottle costs $1, the total amount of money earned from water is 25 x 1 = 25.

4. To find the total amount of money the store earned, we need to add up the money earned from cola, juice, and water. So, 45 + 18 + 25 = 88.

Answer: 88
