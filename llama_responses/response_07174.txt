Let's break it down step by step.

Lulu started with $65 in her piggy bank.

She spent $5 on ice cream, leaving her with:

$65 - $5 = $60

She then spent half of the remainder on a t-shirt, which is:

$60 / 2 = $30

So, she spent $30 on the t-shirt.

After that, she deposited a fifth of her remaining money at the bank. Since she has $30 left, a fifth of that is:

$30 / 5 = $6

So, Lulu is left with:

$30 - $6 = $24

Answer: 24
