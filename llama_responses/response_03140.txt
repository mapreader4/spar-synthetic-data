Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 10 rows of 15 chairs each. The first 3 rows are reserved, leaving 10 - 3 = 7 rows for students.

The number of seats reserved for students is 7 * 15 = 105.

Since only 4/5 of the seats are occupied, we need to find 1/5 of 105, which is 21. So, 21 seats are occupied.

The number of vacant seats for students is 105 - 21 = 84.

The last 2 rows are reserved for parents. The total number of seats reserved for parents is 2 * 15 = 30.

Since we need to give the vacant seats from the students to the parents, we subtract the number of seats reserved for parents from the vacant seats for students:

84 - 30 = 54

Answer: 54
