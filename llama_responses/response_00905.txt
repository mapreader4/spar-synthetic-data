To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many cans of soda one machine produces in 30 minutes.

One machine produces 30 cans of soda in 30 minutes, so to find out how many cans it produces in 1 minute, we can divide 30 by 30.

30 รท 30 = 1

So, one machine produces 1 can of soda in 1 minute.

Step 2: Determine how many minutes are in 8 hours.

60 minutes are in 1 hour, so to find out how many minutes are in 8 hours, we can multiply 60 by 8.

60 x 8 = 480

Step 3: Find out how many cans of soda the machine can produce in 8 hours.

If the machine produces 1 can in 1 minute, and there are 480 minutes in 8 hours, we can multiply the number of cans it produces in 1 minute by 480.

1 x 480 = 480

So, the machine can produce 480 cans of soda in 8 hours.

Answer: 480
