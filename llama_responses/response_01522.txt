Let's break this down step by step.

The recipe requires 3 eggs for every 2 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many eggs are needed for 6 cups of flour.

To do this, we can divide 6 cups of flour by 2 cups of flour to find the number of times the recipe requires 3 eggs. 6 divided by 2 is 3.

So, the baker will need 3 times 3 eggs to use up the 6 cups of flour. That means the baker will need 9 eggs.
