Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first identify the information given in the problem:

* The total cost of Olivia's groceries was $42.
* The bananas cost her $12.
* The bread cost her $9.
* The milk cost her $7.
* The only other groceries she bought were apples.

We know that the total cost of the bananas, bread, and milk is $12 + $9 + $7 = $18. This leaves us with $42 - $18 = $24 left to spend on the apples.

So, the cost of the apples is $24.

Answer: 24
