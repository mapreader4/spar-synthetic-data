Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the given information: Caprice is taking one lesson per week, and each lesson lasts 1 hour. This means that in 5 weeks, she will take 5 lessons.

The teacher earns $10 for each lesson, so for 5 lessons, the teacher would earn:

5 x 10 = 50

So, the answer is: Answer: 50
