Let's start by identifying the number of floors in Building B. We know that Building A has 4 floors, and Building B has 9 less floors than Building A. So, the number of floors in Building B is 4 - 9 = 4 - 9 = -5. Since Building C has 6 less floors than Building B, we can write the number of floors in Building C as 5 x 6 = 30. 

Answer: 30
