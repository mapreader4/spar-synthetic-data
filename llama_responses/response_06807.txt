To make three batches of yogurt, the company needs 10 liters of milk and 3 kilograms of fruit. Milk costs $1.5 per liter, so 10 liters will cost 10 x 1.5 = 15. Fruit costs $2 per kilogram, and 3 kilograms will cost 3 x 2 = 6. So, the total cost of the milk is 15, and the total cost of the fruit is 6. To make 3 batches of yogurt, the total cost will be 15 + 6 = 21. So, the answer is: Answer: 21.
