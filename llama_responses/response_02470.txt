Let's break it down step by step.

Brenda is initially ahead by 22 points.
She makes a 15-point play, so she gains 15 points.
David makes a 32-point play, so he gains 32 points.
Brenda was ahead by 22 points initially, and she gained 15 points, so she is now ahead by 22 + 15 = 37 points.
David gained 32 points, so he is behind by 37 points.

Answer: 37
