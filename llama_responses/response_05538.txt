Let's start by identifying the ratio of cows to bulls as 10:27. We can set up an equation to represent this ratio as a fraction.

Let C be the number of cows and B be the number of bulls. The ratio of cows to bulls is 10:27, so we can set up the equation as follows:

C:Cows to bulls

C:Cows to bulls

We know that the total number of cattle is 555. We can set up the equation as follows:

C + B = 555

We can now substitute the ratio into the equation:

10C = 27B

Now, we can solve for B:

B = 555 / 27

B = 20

So, the number of bulls on the farm is 20.
