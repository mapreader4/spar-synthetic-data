Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Evan had 200 books 2 years ago. This means that Evan has 200 - 40 = 160 books now.

We know that Evan will have 5 times as many books as he owns now in 5 years. So, he will have 5 x 160 = 800 books in 5 years.

To find the total number of books Evan will have in 5 years, we add the number of books he has now (160) to the number of books he will have in 5 years (800).

Answer: 960
