Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carl earns $0.50 each time he goes to the corner market and buys a candy bar. In 4 weeks, he would earn a total of 4 x $0.50 = $2.00. He will earn a total of $2.00.

His neighbor pays him $0.75 every week, so in 4 weeks, he will earn 4 x $0.75 = $3.00. He will earn a total of $3.00.

Now, let's find the difference between the total amount he earns from the neighbor and the total amount he earns from the candy bars. $3.00 - $2.00 = $1.00.

So, Carl will be able to buy $1.00 / $0.50 = 2 candy bars.
