Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the cost of the mouse is $16. We are told that the cost of the keyboard is three times greater than the cost of the mouse. 

Let's write an equation to represent this information: 

Let k be the cost of the keyboard. 

k = 3 * 16

We know that k = 48.

So, Fabian spent 16 + 32 = 48 dollars on his new accessories.

Answer: 48
