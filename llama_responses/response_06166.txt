Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total number of strawberries that were initially present. There were 3 baskets, each with 900 strawberries, so the total number of strawberries is:

900 x 3 = 2700

Since the hedgehogs ate an equal number of strawberries, they each ate 1/3 of the total number of strawberries. To find the number of strawberries each hedgehog ate, we need to divide the total number of strawberries by 3:

2700 รท 3 = 900

So, the answer is:

Answer: 900
