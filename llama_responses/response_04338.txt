Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the total number of fish in the tank is x.

The number of blue fish is one third of the total number of fish, so we can set up an equation: (1/3)x = 10. We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 3: x = 30.

Now, half of the blue fish have spots, which means that 10 blue fish have spots. Since we know that half of the blue fish have spots, we can set up an equation: 1/2 * blue fish with spots = 10. We can solve for blue fish with spots by dividing both sides by 1/2: blue fish with spots = 20.

Now, we know that blue fish = 20 and blue fish = 30. We can add the number of blue fish together to get the total number of fish in the tank: blue fish + blue fish = 20 + 10 = 30.

So, the total number of fish in the tank is 30.
