Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be the number of fish that I added to the tank. Since the problem states that I caught 4 fewer fish than the number in my tank and added them to the tank, we can set up an equation to represent this.

Let's say the number of fish in the tank is x. The problem states that I caught 4 fewer fish than the number in my tank, so we can subtract 4 from x to get the number of fish that I started with. This can be represented as x - 4.

Since I added the fish I caught to the tank, the new total number of fish in the tank is x - 4 + x. The problem states that the tank has 20 fish right now, so we can set up an equation to represent this.

The equation would be x - 4 + x = 20.

Now we can solve for x.

x - 4 + x = 20

We can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 20 + 4

x = 24

So I added 24 fish to the tank.
