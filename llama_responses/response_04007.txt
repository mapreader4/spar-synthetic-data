Let's break this down step by step.

Liz scores 5 points from free throw shots, 3 x 3 = 9 points from three-pointers, and 4 x 2 = 8 points from jump shots. In total, Liz scores 5 + 9 + 8 = 22 points.

The other team scores 10 points in the quarter. So, the difference in points is 22 - 10 = 12. Liz's team is down by 20 points at the start of the quarter, so they are now down by 20 - 12 = 8 points.

Answer: 8
