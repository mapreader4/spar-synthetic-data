Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled after the 3rd turn. We know that the car travels 5 meters after the 1st turn, and 8 meters after the 2nd turn. So, the total distance traveled after the 2nd turn is 5 + 8 = 13 meters.

After the 3rd turn, the car travels some distance, which we don't know yet. Let's call this distance x. Then, the total distance traveled after the 3rd turn is 13 + x.

After the 4th turn, the car exits the tunnel, so the total distance traveled around the ring is the sum of the distances traveled after the 3rd turn and the distance traveled after the 4th turn. We know that the total distance traveled around the ring is 23 meters, so we can set up the equation:

13 + x + distance after 4th turn = 23

We know that the distance after the 4th turn is 0, since the car exits the tunnel after the 4th turn. So, the equation becomes:

13 + x = 23

Subtracting 13 from both sides gives us:

x = 10

So, the car had to travel 10 meters after the 3rd turn.
