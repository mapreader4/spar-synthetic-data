Let's first find the total number of blue and red marbles. Since the ratio of blue to red marbles is 3:4, and there are 19 - 5 = 14 blue marbles, there are 14/4 = 3.5 red marbles. Since 3.5 is not an integer, we can round down to the nearest integer, which is 3. So there are 3 red marbles. To find the difference between the number of red marbles and the number of yellow marbles, we can subtract 3 from 19 - 5 = 14. The answer is 14 - 3 = 11. So, there are 11 more red marbles than yellow marbles.
