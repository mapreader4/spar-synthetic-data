Let's break it down step by step.

The poem has 20 stanzas, and each stanza has 10 lines. So, the total number of lines in the poem is 20 x 10 = 200.

Each line has 8 words, so we multiply the total number of lines by 8 to get the total number of words:

200 lines * 8 = 1600 words

Answer: 1600
