Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the length of Telegraph Road. We are given that it is 162 kilometers long.

Next, let's find the length of Pardee Road. We are given that it is 12000 meters, which is equal to 12 kilometers.

Now, we need to compare the length of Telegraph Road with the length of Pardee Road.

To do this, we will subtract the length of Pardee Road from the length of Telegraph Road.

So, the length of Telegraph Road minus the length of Pardee Road is:

162 kilometers - 12 kilometers = 150 kilometers.

Answer: 150
