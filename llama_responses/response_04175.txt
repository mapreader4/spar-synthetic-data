Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

- The vending machine fails to drop a snack when it's purchased one in six times.
- One in ten times, it will accidentally drop two snacks.
- The rest of the time, it drops the purchased snack.
- Thirty people have used the vending machine once each to purchase a snack.

Let's think about this step by step.

1. When 30 people have used the vending machine once each, it will drop a snack 30 times (1 in 6 times + 2 in 10 times).
2. So, the vending machine dropped 30 snacks.

Answer: 30
