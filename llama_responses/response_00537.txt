Let's break this down step by step.

1. The number of experienced sailors is given as 17 - 5 = 12. The experienced sailors are paid 1/5 times more than the inexperienced sailors, so the experienced sailors are paid 1.2 times the 10 dollars per hour that the inexperienced sailors are paid.

2. The inexperienced sailors are paid 10 dollars per hour for a 60-hour workweek, so they earn 10 * 60 = 600 dollars per month.

3. The experienced sailors are paid 1.2 times the 10 dollars per hour that the inexperienced sailors are paid, so they earn 1.2 * 600 = 720 dollars per month.

4. The total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors are the sum of their individual earnings, which is 12 * 720 = 8640 dollars.

Answer: 8640
