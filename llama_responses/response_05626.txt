Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of students who voted.

25% of 2000 is 25/100 * 2000 = 500.

The winner got 55% of the votes, so the winner got 55/100 * 2000 = 1100 votes.

The loser got the rest, which is 2000 - 500 = 1500 votes.

To find the difference in votes, we subtract the loser's votes from the winner's votes.

1100 - 1500 = 400.

So, the winner got 400 more votes than the loser.

Answer: 400
