Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total cost of the books is the number of students multiplied by the cost of one book: 30 students x $12 per book = 30 x 12 = $360.
2. Sally has $320 to spend, which is the initial amount of money she has for the books.
3. The total cost of the books is $360, but Sally only has $320. To find out how much she needs to pay out of pocket, we need to subtract the initial amount from the total cost: $360 - $320 = $40.

Answer: 40
