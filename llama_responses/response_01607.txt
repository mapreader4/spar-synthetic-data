Let's start by using the information given. We know that Jean has three times as much money as Jane. Let's call Jane's money x. So Jean's money is 3x. We know that the total money is 76. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x = 76. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3 to get x = 76/3. x = 25. So Jean has 25 dollars.
