Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of teeth removed for each person.

1. The first person had 1/4 of his teeth removed. Since he had 32 teeth, 1/4 of 32 is:

32 * (1/4) = 8

So, the first person had 8 teeth removed.

2. The second person had 3/8 of his teeth removed. Since he also had 32 teeth, 3/8 of 32 is:

32 * (3/8) = 12

So, the second person had 12 teeth removed.

3. The third person had half of his teeth removed. Since he also had 32 teeth, half of 32 is:

32 * (1/2) = 16

So, the third person had 16 teeth removed.

4. The last person only had 4 teeth removed.

Now, let's add up the total number of teeth removed:

8 + 12 + 16 + 4 = 40

Answer: 40
