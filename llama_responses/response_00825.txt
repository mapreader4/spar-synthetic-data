Let's break it down step by step:

1. The bed frame costs $75.
2. The bed is 10 times the price of the bed frame, so the bed costs 10 x $75 = $750.
3. James gets a 20% discount on the total price of the bed and bed frame.
4. 20% of $750 is 0.20 x $750 = $150.
5. So, James pays 750 - 150 = $600.

Answer: 600
