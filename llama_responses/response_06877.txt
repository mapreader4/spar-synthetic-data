Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that there are 12 more green apples than red apples. This means that the number of green apples is greater than the number of red apples. We are also given the number of red apples, which is 16.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say let G be the number of green apples and R be the number of red apples. The statement "There are 12 more green apples than red apples" can be written as G > R. We are given that G = R + 12.

We are also given that G = 16, so we can substitute this into the equation. So, R + 12 = 16. This means that R = 4.

So, there are 4 red apples in the bowl.
