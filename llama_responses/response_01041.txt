Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say that there are 650 people who received the vaccine. Of these, 80% are adults.

Let's find the number of adults: 0.8 x 650 = 520.

Now, we know that 520 people are adults. But the problem asks us to find the number of children. Since 650 - 520 = 130.

Answer: 130
