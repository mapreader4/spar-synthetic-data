To find the cost of the two cellphones, I will multiply the cost of one cellphone by 2.

Cost of one cellphone = $800
Cost of two cellphones = $800 * 2 = $1600

Since Miley is getting a 5% discount, I will calculate the discount by multiplying the total cost by 0.95.

Discounted cost = $1600 * 0.95 = $1520

Answer: 1520
