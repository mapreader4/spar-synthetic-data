Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know there are 35 students in the class. Then, there are 5 volunteer chaperones. So, the total number of people going on the trip is 35 + 5 = 40.

The teacher also ordered 3 additional sack lunches, so the total number of lunches is 40 + 3 = 43.

Each sack lunch costs $7. So, to find the total cost, we multiply 43 (the number of lunches) by $7 (the cost of each lunch). 43 * 7 = 301.

Answer: 301
