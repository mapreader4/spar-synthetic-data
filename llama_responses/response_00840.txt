Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the amount of food each dog eats in a day. Since a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, it eats 12 pounds of food in a day.

Since there are 3 dogs, the total amount of food the dogs eat in a day would be 12 * 3 = 36 pounds.

Now, let's find the amount of food the puppies eat. Since each puppy eats twice as much food as a dog, and a dog eats 12 pounds of food, a puppy eats 24 pounds of food. Since there are 4 puppies, the total amount of food the puppies eat is 24 * 4 = 96 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day. The total is the sum of the food eaten by the dogs and puppies, which is 36 + 96 = 132 pounds.

Answer: 132
