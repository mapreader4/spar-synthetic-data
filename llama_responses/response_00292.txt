Let's break this down step by step.

We know that May can knit 1 scarf using 1 yarn. We also know that she has 2 red yarns, 6 blue yarns, and 4 yellow yarns.

We can first use the red yarns. She can make 2 scarves with the 2 red yarns. Then, she can use the blue yarns to make 3 scarves. Finally, she can use the yellow yarns to make 4 scarves.

So, in total, May can make 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 scarves.
