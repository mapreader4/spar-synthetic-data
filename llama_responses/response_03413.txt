Let's break this down step by step:

1. Mike throws 20 seeds to the birds on the left.
2. He throws twice as much to the bigger group of birds on the right. Twice of 20 is 40, so he throws 40 seeds to the bigger group.
3. Some more birds flutter over to join the others for lunch and Mike throws 30 more seeds for them.
4. Now, Mike has 30 seeds left to feed the last of the birds.

Let's add the seeds he threw to the birds on the left (20) and the seeds to the bigger group (40) and the seeds for the new birds (30). The total number of seeds he threw is 20 + 40 + 30 = 90.

To find out how many seeds Mike started with, we need to subtract the number of seeds he threw (90) from the number of seeds he has left (30).

Answer: 30
