Let's break this problem down step by step.

Grant sold his baseball cards for $25, which means he made $25.

He got $10 for his baseball bat, so he made $10.

He sold his $30 baseball glove at 20% off, which means he sold it for $30 - (20% of $30) = $24. So, he made $24.

He sold both pairs of baseball cleats for $10 each, so he made $10 + $10 = $20.

To find the total amount of money Grant made, we add up the amounts:

$25 + $10 + $24 + $20 = $59

Answer: 59
