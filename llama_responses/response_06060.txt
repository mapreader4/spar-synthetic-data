Let's think step by step!

Let's first find out how much Joy paid for her pencils.

Joy has 30 pencils, so she paid 30 * 4 = 120 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much Colleen paid for her pencils.

Colleen has 50 pencils, so she paid 50 * 4 = 200 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the amount Joy paid from the amount Colleen paid.

200 - 120 = 80.

So, Colleen paid 80 dollars more than Joy for her pencils.

Answer: 80
