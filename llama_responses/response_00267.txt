Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pizzas Jimmy can make in 7 hours. Since he takes 10 minutes to make each pizza, we can convert the time from hours to minutes: 7 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes.

Now, let's divide the total time (420 minutes) by the time it takes to make each pizza (10 minutes): 420 minutes รท 10 minutes/pizza = 42 pizzas.

This means Jimmy can make 42 pizzas in 7 hours. Now, let's calculate how much flour he will use to make these pizzas. Each pizza requires 0.5 kg of flour, so for 42 pizzas, he will need:

42 pizzas x 0.5 kg/pizza = 21 kg of flour

Since Jimmy started with a 22 kg sack of flour, he will have:

22 kg - 21 kg = 1 kg of flour left

Now, let's find out how many pizzas he can make with the leftover flour. Since each pizza requires 0.5 kg of flour, we can divide the leftover flour by 0.5 kg:

1 kg รท 0.5 kg/pizza = 2 pizzas
