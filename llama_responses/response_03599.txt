Let's break this problem down step by step.

Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp. Austin's trap caught 8 less than Victor's, so Austin's trap caught 26 - 8 = 18 shrimp.

The total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin is 26 + 18 = 44.

Brian's trap caught half of this total, which is 44 / 2 = 22 shrimp.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shrimp caught by all three boys: 26 + 18 + 22 = 66.

They sell their shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp, so they will get:

66 / 11 = 6 groups of 11 shrimp, with 2 shrimp left over.

6 groups of 11 shrimp will earn them 6 x 7 = 42 dollars.

The boys will also get 2 shrimp as extra, which will earn them 2 / 11 x 7 = 2 dollars.

So, the total amount of money earned is 42 + 2 = 44 dollars.

Since they divide the earnings equally, each boy will get 44 / 3 = 14.67 dollars.
