Let's break this problem down step by step.

On Monday, Matt worked for 450 minutes.
On Tuesday, he worked half the number of minutes he worked on Monday.  Half of 450 is 225.
So, on Tuesday, Matt worked 225 minutes.
On Wednesday, he worked for 300 minutes.
So, to find the difference between the number of minutes Matt worked on Wednesday and Tuesday, we subtract 300 from 225.  300 - 225 is 75.

Answer: 75
