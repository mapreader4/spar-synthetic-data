Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Thomas is 6 years old. His sister Shay is 13 years older than him, which means Shay is 6 + 13 = 19 years old. James is 5 years older than Shay, which means James is 19 + 5 = 24 years old.

To find the age James will be by the time Thomas reaches his current age, we need to add the difference between James' current age and Thomas' current age to Thomas' current age. The difference between James' age and Thomas' age is 24 - 6 = 18 years.

So, James will be 6 + 18 = 24 years old by the time Thomas reaches his current age.

Answer: 24
