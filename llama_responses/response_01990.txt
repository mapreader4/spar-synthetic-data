Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the year of the second car is x. Since the first car was made 10 years before the second car, we know the year of the first car is x - 10.

The third car was made 20 years after the second car. So, the year of the third car is x + 20.

So, we know that x - 10 + 20 = x.

This is an equation. Let's solve for x.

x - 10 + 20 = x

x = 30

So, the third car was made in the year 30.

Answer: 30
