Let's break this down step by step:

Let's first find the total number of knockouts Rocky had. Since 50 percent of the fights were knockouts, and 20 percent of the knockouts were in the first round, we can set up an equation to represent this information.

Let x be the number of knockouts in the first round.

We know that 20 percent of the knockouts were in the first round, and 50 percent of the fights were knockouts, so we can set up the equation:

20% of x = 50%

We can simplify this equation to get:

x = 0.2 * 50 = 10

So Rocky had 10 knockouts in the first round.

Answer: 10
