Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Greta's turtle took x minutes.  George's turtle took x - 2 minutes.  Gloria's turtle took 2x minutes.

We know that Greta's turtle took 6 minutes.  So, we can set up an equation:

x - 2 = 6

We can solve for x by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:

x = 4

So, it took Gloria's turtle 4 minutes to finish the race.
