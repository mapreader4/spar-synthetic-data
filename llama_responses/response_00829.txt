To find the number of tickets Jeanne needs to buy, we need to find the total number of tickets required to ride all three rides. The Ferris wheel requires 5 tickets, the roller coaster requires 4 tickets, and the bumper cars require 4 tickets. So, the total number of tickets required is 5 + 4 + 4 = 13. Jeanne has 5 tickets. So, Jeanne needs to buy 13 - 5 = 8 more tickets.
