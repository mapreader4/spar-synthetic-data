Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* I will have double my brother's number of marbles, so if my brother has x marbles, I will have 2x marbles.
* My friend will have triple the number I do, so if I have x marbles, my friend will have 3x marbles.
* The total number of marbles we have together is 63.

Let's let's say my brother has x marbles. Then, I will have 2x marbles and my friend will have 3x marbles.

We know that the total number of marbles we have together is 63. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 63

We can combine like terms:

x + 2x + 3x = 63

Combine like terms:

4x = 63

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 63 / 4
x = 15.75

So, I have 15.75 marbles.
