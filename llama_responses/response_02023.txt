Let's start by finding her sister's current age. Since her little sister is 5 years old, and since her sister is 13 years older than her, her age is 13 + 5 = 18. So, to find out how many years it would take for her to be twice her sister's age, we can subtract 18 from her age. 18 - 18 = 0. So, the answer is 0 years.
