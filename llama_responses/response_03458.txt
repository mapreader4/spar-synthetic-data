Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Jake delivers 234 newspapers a week.
* Miranda delivers twice as many newspapers a week.

To find the number of newspapers Miranda delivers in a week, we need to multiply the number of newspapers Jake delivers in a week by 2, since Miranda delivers twice as many newspapers a week.

The number of newspapers Jake delivers in a week is 234. So, the number of newspapers Miranda delivers in a week is 2 x 234 = 468.

Now, to find the difference between the number of newspapers Miranda delivers in a month and the number of newspapers Jake delivers in a week, we subtract 234 from 468.

The difference is 234.

Answer: 234
