Let's solve this problem step by step.

We can start by finding the number of red balloons. There are 20 red balloons initially, and 3 of them burst, so there are 20 - 3 = 17 red balloons left.

Next, we can find the number of green balloons. There are 15 green balloons initially, and 2 of them burst, so there are 15 - 2 = 13 green balloons left.

Now, we can find the total number of balloons left. We have 17 red balloons and 13 green balloons, so the total number of balloons left is 17 + 13 = 30 balloons.

Answer: 30
