Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many pounds Seth lost. Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Then, Jerome lost three times that amount, which is 3 * 17.5 = 52.5 pounds. Finally, Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth, which is 17.5 + 1.5 = 18.5 pounds.

Now, let's add up the pounds lost by each person:

Seth: 17.5 pounds
Jerome: 52.5 pounds
Veronica: 18.5 pounds

The total pounds lost is: 17.5 + 52.5 + 18.5 = 88 pounds.

Answer: 88
