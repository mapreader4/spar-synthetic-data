Let's break this down step by step.

There are 3 blue horses. There are 3 times as many purple horses as blue horses, so that is 3 x 3 = 9 purple horses. There are twice as many green horses as purple horses, so there are 9 x 2 = 18 green horses. There are 1/6th as many gold horses as green horses, so there are 18 / 6 = 3 gold horses.

So, the total number of horses is 3 + 9 + 18 + 3 = 33.

Answer: 33
