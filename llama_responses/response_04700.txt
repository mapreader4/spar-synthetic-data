Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.
2. Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, so Kenley has 2 x 34 = 68 stuffed animals.
3. Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.

Now, let's add the number of stuffed animals each girl has. 

Answer: 34 + 68 + 73 = 165
