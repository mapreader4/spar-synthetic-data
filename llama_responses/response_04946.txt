Let's start by using the information given that there are ten more seeds in bucket A than in bucket B. This means that bucket A has 10 more seeds than bucket B. Bucket A has 10 seeds more than bucket B, so bucket A has 10 + 30 = 40 seeds. We know that bucket A has 40 seeds.

Now, we know that the total number of seeds is 100. We know that bucket A has 40 seeds, and bucket B has 30 seeds. So, bucket C has 100 - 40 - 30 = 30 seeds. Answer: 30
