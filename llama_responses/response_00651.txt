Let's break this problem down step by step.

Olivia earns $9 per hour.  She worked 4 hours on Monday, which means she earned 4 x $9 = $36.  She worked 3 hours on Wednesday, which is 3 x $9 = $27.  She worked 6 hours on Friday, which is 6 x $9 = $54.  So, in total, Olivia earned $36 + $27 + $54 = $117.
