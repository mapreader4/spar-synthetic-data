Let's break it down step by step.

1. The salesman bought a case of 48 backpacks for $576.

2. He sold 17 backpacks for $18 at the swap meet.

3. 48 - 17 = 31 backpacks were left over.

4. He sold 10 backpacks for $25 each to the department store.

5. 31 - 10 = 21 backpacks were left over.

6. The remaining backpacks were sold for $22 each.

7. 21 backpacks x $22 = 462.

8. The salesman's profit is the difference between the cost of the backpacks and the amount he earned.

9. 576 - 462 = 114.

10. So the salesman's profit is 114.
