Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that Nicole answered 3 fewer questions correctly than Kim, so Kim must have answered 3 + 3 = 6 questions correctly. We also know that Kim answered 8 more questions correctly than Cherry, so Cherry must have answered 6 + 8 = 14 questions correctly. Since Nicole answered 22 correctly, we can subtract 22 from 14 to find out how many Cherry answered correctly, which is 14 - 22 = -8. However, this is not possible, so the answer must be wrong.
