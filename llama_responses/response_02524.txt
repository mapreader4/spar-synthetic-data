Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The total volume of helium is 1800cm³.
2. 50 balloons need 50cm³ of helium each. So, the total helium needed for the 50 balloons is 50 * 50 = 2500cm³.
3. After filling the 50 balloons, the remaining helium is 1800 - 2500 = 1300cm³.
4. Since 50cm³ is needed for one balloon to touch the ceiling, we can fill the remaining 1300cm³ of helium into balloons that need 50cm³ each. We can calculate the number of balloons that can be filled with 1300cm³ of helium as follows: 1300cm³ ÷ 50cm³ = 26.
5. These 26 balloons will not be filled with helium, so the number of balloons that are touching the ceiling is 50 - 26 = 24.

Answer: 24
