To find the amount of tax, we need to find 15% of the cost of the earbuds. To do this, we multiply the cost of the earbuds by 0.15.

Cost of earbuds = $200
Tax = 0.15 x $200 = $30

To find the amount John paid, we subtract the tax from the cost of the earbuds.

Amount paid = $200 - $30 = $170

Answer: $170
