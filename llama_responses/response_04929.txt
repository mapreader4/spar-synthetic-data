Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know: John is 39 years old, and 3 years ago, he was twice as old as James will be in 6 years.

This means that 3 years ago, John was 39 - 3 = 36 years old.

Since James will be twice as old as John was 36 years old 3 years ago, James will be 36 x 2 = 72 years old in 6 years.

Since James' older brother is 4 years older than James, James' older brother is 72 + 4 = 76 years old.

Answer: 76
