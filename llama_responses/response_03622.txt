Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Jeanine bought 18 pencils.
2. Clare bought half as many pencils as Jeanine, so Clare bought 18 / 2 = 9 pencils.
3. Jeanine gave one third of his pencils to Abby, which is 18 / 3 = 6 pencils.
4. Jeanine has 18 - 6 = 12 pencils left.
5. So Jeanine has 12 pencils more than Clare.
