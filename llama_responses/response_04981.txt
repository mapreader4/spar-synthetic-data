Let's start by identifying the amount spent by Lev and Ambrocio. We know that Lev spent one-third of Akeno's amount, so Lev spent 1/3 * 2985 = 986 dollars. We know that Ambrocio spent 177 less than Lev, so Ambrocio spent 986 - 177 = 809 dollars. Now we can find the difference between the amount spent by Akeno and the sum of the amounts spent by Lev and Ambrocio. Akeno spent 2985, Lev spent 986, and Ambrocio spent 809. So, the difference is 2985 - (986 + 809) = 90.
