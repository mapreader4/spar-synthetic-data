Let's break this problem down step by step.

There are 12 bars in the box.

The problem asks us to find out how many bars Mike and Rita got, so we need to find the total number of bars they got. Since they are sharing the box equally, they must have the same number of bars.

So, we can write an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of bars Mike got, then Rita must get x bars.

Since they are sharing the box equally, we know that Rita must also get x bars.

So, the equation is:

x + x = 12

We can add x to both sides of the equation to get:

2x = 12

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

So, Mike and Rita got 6 bars each.

Answer: 6
