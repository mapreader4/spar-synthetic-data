Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the distance each of them will skate in 3 hours.

Ann can skate 6 miles per hour. So in 3 hours, she will skate 6 * 3 = 18 miles.

Glenda can skate 8 miles per hour. So in 3 hours, she will skate 8 * 3 = 24 miles.

Since they start in the same place, they will be 18 + 24 = 42 miles apart after 3 hours.

So, the answer is: Answer: 42
