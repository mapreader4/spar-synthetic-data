Let's start by adding the bills that Luke's mother gave him. She gave him one $50 bill, two $20 bills, and three $10 bills. This is a total of 1 x $50 + 2 x $20 + 3 x $10 = $160. Now, let's add the bills that his father gave him. He gave him four $50 bills, one $20 bill, and one $10 bill. This is a total of 4 x $50 + 1 x $20 + 1 x $10 = $180. To find the total amount of money Luke received, we add the two amounts together. $160 + $180 = $340. So, the school fee is $340.
