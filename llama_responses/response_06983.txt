Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find the total number of hours the Ferris wheel is open.

The Ferris wheel is open from 1:00 pm to 7:00 pm, which is a total of 6 hours.

The Ferris wheel can accommodate 70 people in 20 minutes. 20 minutes is the same as 1/3 of an hour. So, if the Ferris wheel is open for 6 hours, the number of people who can ride is 6 * 70/3 = 120.

So, the number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is 120.

Answer: 120
