Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of tortilla chips Nancy has. She starts with 22 tortilla chips. Then, she gives 7 to her brother and 5 to her sister. So, the number of tortilla chips she gives away is 7 + 5 = 12.

So, the number of tortilla chips Nancy keeps for herself is 22 - 12 = 10.
