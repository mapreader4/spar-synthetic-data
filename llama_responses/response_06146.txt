Let's break this down step by step.

Erika has saved $155 and her brother has saved half of the cost of the gift, which is $250 / 2 = $125. So, together they have saved $155 + $125 = $280.

The cost of the gift is $250, so they will spend $250. After spending $250, they will be left with $280 - $250 = $30.

The birthday cake costs $25, so they will spend another $25. After spending $25, they will be left with $30 - $25 = $5.
