To find the total number of books in the library, we can add the number of books intended for children to the number of books intended for adults. 35% of the books are intended for children, and 104 of them are intended for adults. So, we can convert the percentage of children's books to a decimal: 0.35. Multiplying the decimal 0.35 by the number of children's books, we get 35. Adding the number of children's books to the number of adult books, we get 35 + 104 = 139 books.
