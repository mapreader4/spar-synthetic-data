Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. We know that Maria buys 1 bar of soap for 8.00 dollars.
2. We know that the soap lasts for 2 months.
3. We want to know how much Maria will spend on soap for the entire year.

To find the total cost of soap for the entire year, we can multiply the cost per bar of soap by the number of bars of soap used in a year.

There are 12 months in a year.  So, Maria uses 24 bars of soap in a year (2 months * 12).

The cost of 24 bars of soap will be 24 * 8.00 = 192.00.

Answer: 192.00
