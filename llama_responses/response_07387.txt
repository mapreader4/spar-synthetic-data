Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how much money Amanda makes in a day. If she makes $50.00 an hour and works for 10 hours a day, she will make:

$50.00 * 10 = $500.00

So, in a day, Amanda makes $500.00.

Now, let's find out how much money she will receive if she does not finish the sales report by midnight. Jose said she will withhold 20% of her pay. 20% of $500.00 is:

$500.00 * 0.20 = $100.00

So, Amanda will receive $400.00 if she does not finish the sales report by midnight.

Answer: 400
