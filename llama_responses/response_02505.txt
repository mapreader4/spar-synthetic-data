Let's break this down step by step:

Bob spent $34 on the necklace, which is within the $70 limit. Then, he bought a book that is $5 more expensive than the necklace. So, the book is $34 + $5 = $39. To find how much over the limit he spent, we need to subtract the cost of the necklace from the total cost of the book: $39 - $34 = $5.

So, Bob spent $5 over the limit.
