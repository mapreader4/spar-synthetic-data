Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Cindy tosses 5 dimes into the wishing pond. That means she adds 5 * 10 cents = 50 cents to the total amount of money in the pond.
2. Eric flips 3 quarters into the pond. That means he adds 3 * 25 cents = 75 cents to the total amount of money in the pond.
3. Garrick throws in 8 nickels into the pond. That means he adds 8 * 5 cents = 40 cents to the total amount of money in the pond.
4. Ivy then drops 60 pennies into the pond. That means she adds 60 cents to the total amount of money in the pond.

Now, Eric dips his hands into the water and pulls out a quarter. That means he takes out 25 cents from the total amount of money in the pond.

To find the total amount of money in the pond, we add the money from Cindy, Eric, and Ivy:

50 cents + 75 cents + 40 cents + 60 cents - 25 cents = 200 cents

So, the total amount of money in the pond is 200 cents.
