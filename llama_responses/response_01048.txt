Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the first neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water. Then, the second neighborhood uses twice as much water, so it uses 2 x 150 = 300 barrels of water. The third neighborhood uses 100 more than the second neighborhood, so it uses 300 + 100 = 400 barrels of water. 

The total water used by the first three neighborhoods is 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels of water. The total capacity of the water tank is 1200 barrels. 

To find out how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood, we subtract the total water used by the first three neighborhoods from the total capacity of the water tank: 1200 - 850 = 350.

Answer: 350
