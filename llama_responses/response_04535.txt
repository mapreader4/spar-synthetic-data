Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of animals at the farm.

There are 26 chickens and 40 piglets. To find the total number of animals, we add them together: 26 + 40 = 66.

Then, there are 34 goats.

Now, half of all the animals get sick. Half of 66 is 33, and half of 34 is 17. So, 33 + 17 = 50.

So, 50 animals get sick.
