Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many cupcakes Robin ate with chocolate sauce. Robin ate four cupcakes with chocolate sauce. So, Robin ate 4 cupcakes.

Next, let's find out how many cupcakes Robin ate with buttercream frosting. Robin ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting as the number of cupcakes she ate with chocolate sauce. Since Robin ate 4 cupcakes with chocolate sauce, she ate twice that number of cupcakes with buttercream frosting. So, Robin ate 8 cupcakes with buttercream frosting.

To find the total number of cupcakes Robin ate, we add the number of cupcakes with chocolate sauce and the number of cupcakes with buttercream frosting:

4 + 8 = 12

Answer: 12
