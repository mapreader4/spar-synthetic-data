Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of pages in the history and geography textbooks. The history textbook has 160 pages, and the geography textbook has 70 more pages, so the total number of pages in the two textbooks is 160 + 70 = 230 pages.

The math textbook has half of the sum of the first two books' pages, so it has half of 230, which is 115 pages.

The science textbook has twice the number of pages of her history textbook, which is 2 x 160 = 320 pages.

Now, let's add up the total number of pages in all the textbooks: 160 (history) + 70 (geography) + 115 (math) + 320 (science) = 565.

Answer: 565
