Let's start by identifying the cost of the tickets. There are 4 people going to the concert, including Daria herself. The cost of one ticket is $90. So the total cost of the tickets is 4 x $90 = $360. Since Daria currently has $189, we can subtract the cost of the tickets from her money. 

Answer: $189 - $360 = $129.
