Let's break this problem down step by step.

Marta bought 5 textbooks for $10 each, so that's a total of:

5 x 10 = 50

She also bought 2 textbooks online for a total of $40.

And she bought 3 textbooks directly from the bookstore for a total of 3 times the cost of the online ordered books, which is:

40 x 3 = 120

To find the total amount Marta spent, we add the cost of the in-store and online textbooks:

50 + 120 = 170

Answer: 170
