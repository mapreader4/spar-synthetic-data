Let's break down the cost of the sundaes:

Alicia's sundae: $7.50
Brant's sundae: $10.00
Josh's sundae: $8.50
Yvette's sundae: $9.00

Total cost of sundaes: $7.50 + $10.00 + $8.50 + $9.00 = $26.00

The tip is 20% of the total cost, which is $26.00. To find the tip, multiply $26.00 by 0.20, which is $5.20. So, the total bill will be $26.00 + $5.20 = $31.20.

Answer: 31.20
