Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many paychecks Jackson will have in 15 months. Since he gets paid 2 times a month, that's 2 paychecks per month. There are 15 months in 1 year and a half, so we need to multiply 15 by 2 to get the total number of paychecks:

15 months x 2 paychecks/month = 30 paychecks

Now, we need to divide the total amount Jackson wants to save, $3,000.00, by the number of paychecks he has:

$3,000.00 รท 30 paychecks = $100.00 per paycheck

So, Jackson needs to set aside $100.00 per paycheck to have enough money saved for his vacation.

Answer: $100.00
