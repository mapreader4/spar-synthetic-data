Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Mason is three times younger than Sydney. Sydney's age is unknown, but we can call it x. So, we can write an equation:

Mason's age = 3 * Sydney's age.

Now, we know Mason is 20 years old. So, we can write another equation:

20 = 3 * Sydney's age.

We can solve for Sydney's age by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

Sydney's age = 20 / 3
Sydney's age = 6.67

Since Sydney is six years younger than Mason's father, we know that Sydney's age is 6 years less than his father's age. So, we can write another equation:

Sydney's age + 6 = father's age

We don't know the father's age, but we can write another equation:

father's age - 6 = Sydney's age
father's age = 6 + Sydney's age

We can solve for the father's age by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

father's age = 6 + Sydney's age
father's age = 6 + 6.67
father's age = 12.67

So, the father is 12.67 years old.

Answer: 12.67
