Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's first calculate the total cost of the shirts.

Dennis bought shirts worth $27. Let's break it down into its parts:

* 2 $10 bills and $3 in loose coins.

$10 = 10 dollars
$3 = 3 dollars

The total cost of the shirts is $27.

Now, let's calculate the change Dennis received.

The change Dennis received is the difference between the total cost and the initial amount of money he had.

Let's subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Dennis had:

$27 - 10 dollars = 17 dollars

$17 is the change Dennis received.

Answer: 17
