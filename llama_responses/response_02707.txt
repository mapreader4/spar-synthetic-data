Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the variables.

Let's say Renaldo drove x kilometers. Then, Ernesto drove 7 kilometers more than one-third of Renaldo's distance, which is 1/3x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total distance they drove:

x + (1/3x + 7) = 15

We can solve for x:

x + (1/3x) = 15 - 7
x = 8

So Renaldo drove 8 kilometers. Ernesto drove 7 kilometers more than one-third of Renaldo's distance, which is 7 kilometers. So, the total distance they drove is:

8 + 7 = 15

Answer: 15
