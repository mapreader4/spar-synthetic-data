Let's break down the process step by step.

1. Folding the dough takes 4 times, which takes 5 minutes each time, so it takes a total of 4 x 5 = 20 minutes.
2. Letting the dough rest for 75 minutes each time, so it takes 4 x 75 = 300 minutes, which is equal to 5 hours.
3. Mixing the ingredients takes 10 minutes.
4. Baking the croissants takes 30 minutes.

To find the total time, we add up the time for each step: 20 minutes (folding) + 5 hours (resting) + 10 minutes (mixing) + 30 minutes (baking) = 5 hours and 20 minutes.

Answer: 5 hours and 20 minutes.
