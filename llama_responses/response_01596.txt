Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first month, Nina travels 400 kilometers outside her home country.
2. In the second month, she travels twice as far, which is 2 x 400 = 800 kilometers.
3. She continues this pattern for 2 years, which is 24 months.
4. So, in each month, she travels 400 or 800 kilometers, so in 24 months, she will travel 24 x 400 or 24 x 800 kilometers.

Answer: 19200
