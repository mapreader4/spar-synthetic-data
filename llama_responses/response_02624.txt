Let's think step by step!

Let's first find the original price of the DVDs. Let's call the original price "x".

The discount is 25%, which is a percentage of the original price. To find the discount, we can multiply the original price by 0.25 (which is the decimal form of 25%).

The discount is $40, so we can set up the equation:

x - (0.25x) = 40

To solve for x, we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 40 / 0.25

x = 160

So, the original price of the DVDs is $160. Since Maria received a 25% discount, she paid:

Answer: 160 - 40 = 120
