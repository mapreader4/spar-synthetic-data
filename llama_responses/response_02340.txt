Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Jamal has a cart full of books to put away in different sections.
2. In the history section, he shelves 12 books.
3. In the fiction section, he shelves 19 books.
4. In the children's section, he shelves 8 books but finds 4 that were left in the wrong place that he adds to his cart to shelve elsewhere.
5. He still has 16 books to shelve.

Now, let's find the total number of books he started with in the cart.

Step 1: Jamal has a cart full of books.
Step 2: He shelves 12 books in the history section.
Step 3: He shelves 19 books in the fiction section.
Step 4: He shelves 8 books in the children's section and finds 4 that were left in the wrong place, so he adds them to his cart to shelve elsewhere.
Step 5: He still has 16 books to shelve.

To find the total number of books he started with in the cart, we need to add the books he shelves in each section. So, we have:

12 + 19 + 8 = 39

Answer: 39
