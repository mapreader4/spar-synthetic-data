Let's start by identifying the amount of sauce needed for each burger. Each burger takes 1/6 cup of sauce. So, for 18 burgers, Jack needs 18 * 1/6 = 3 cups of sauce. Now, Jack has 3 cups of ketchup, 1 cup of vinegar, and 1 cup of honey. The total amount of sauce is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 cups. Since 5 cups of sauce is less than 18 cups, Jack can make 18 burgers.
