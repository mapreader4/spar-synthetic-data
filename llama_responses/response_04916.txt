Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, the bag has 7 apples, 8 oranges, and 15 mangoes.

Luisa takes out 2 apples, leaving 7 - 2 = 5 apples.

She then takes out twice as many oranges as apples, which is 2 * 2 = 4 oranges. The bag now has 8 - 4 = 4 oranges left.

Finally, she takes out 2/3 of the mangoes, which is 15 * 2/3 = 10 mangoes. 15 - 10 = 5 mangoes left.

So, the remaining fruits in the bag are:

* Apples: 5
* Oranges: 4
* Mangoes: 5

Adding these up, the total number of fruits left in the bag is 5 + 4 + 5 = 14.

Answer: 14
