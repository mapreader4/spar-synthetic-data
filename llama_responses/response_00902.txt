Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Troy had 300 straws.
* He fed 3/5 of the straws to the adult pigs.
* An equal number of straws were given to the piglets.
* There were 20 piglets.

We can start by identifying the number of straws given to the adult pigs. We know that 3/5 of the 300 straws were given to the adult pigs, which is equal to 180 straws.

Now, since an equal number of straws were given to the piglets, we know that the piglets also received 180 straws.

To find out how many straws each piglet ate, we can divide the total number of straws given to the piglets (180) by the number of piglets (20):

180 รท 20 = 9

Answer: 9
