To find the length of the rectangle, we can use the formula A = L * W, where A is the area and W is the width. 

First, we need to find the length of the rectangle. We know the area is 1638 and the width is 42. 

We can set up an equation: 

1638 = L * 42

We can solve for L by dividing both sides by 42:

L = 1638 / 42

L = 39

So, the length of the rectangle is 39.
