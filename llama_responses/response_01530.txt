Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of pages Miles will read. Since Miles will read for 1/3 of his day, and 1/3 of his day is 8 hours, the total number of hours he will read is 8 hours.

Since Miles reads novels for 21 pages an hour, we can find the total number of pages he will read in novels as follows:

8 hours * 21 pages per hour = 168 pages

Miles reads graphic novels for 30 pages an hour. We can find the total number of pages he will read in graphic novels as follows:

8 hours * 30 pages per hour = 240 pages

Miles reads comic books for 45 pages an hour. We can find the total number of pages he will read in comic books as follows:

8 hours * 45 pages per hour = 360 pages

To find the total number of pages Miles will read, we add the number of pages he will read in novels, graphic novels, and comic books:

168 pages + 240 pages + 360 pages = 668 pages

So, the answer is:

Answer: 668
