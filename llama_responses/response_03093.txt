Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Madeline wants to plant 20 flowers. She assumes that about half of the seeds will die before they bloom. So, she needs 20 x 0.5 = 10 seeds to be successful in planting 20 flowers.

2. The flower shop sells seeds in packs of 25 seeds per pack. So, to get 10 seeds, Madeline will need to buy 10 / 25 = 0.4 packs.

3. Each pack of seeds costs $5. So, the total cost will be 0.4 x 5 = $2.
