Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of scoops in each order:

1. The cone has 1 scoop.
2. The banana split has 3 times as many scoops as the cone, so the banana split has 3 scoops.
3. The waffle bowl has 1 more scoop than the banana split, so the waffle bowl has 3 + 1 = 4 scoops.

Now, let's add up the scoops:
1 (cone) + 3 (banana split) + 4 (waffle bowl) = 8

So, the ice cream man served a total of 8 scoops.
