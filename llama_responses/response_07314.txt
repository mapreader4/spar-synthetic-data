Let's start by finding out how many fries he can make with the 15 potatoes.  25 fries per potato, so 15 potatoes will give him 25 * 15 = 375 fries.  He needs 200 fries, but he has already made 375.  To find out how many potatoes he has leftover, we need to subtract the number of fries he made from the number of fries he needs. 200 - 375 = 25.  So, he will have 25 potatoes leftover.
