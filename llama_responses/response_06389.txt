Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of trash cans in Central Park. Since it has 8 more than half of the number of trash cans in Veteran's Park, and Veteran's Park has 24 trash cans, the number of trash cans in Central Park is 24 + 8 = 32.

Now, someone took half of the trash cans from Central Park and put them in Veteran's Park. So, half of 32 is 32 / 2 = 16. This means 16 trash cans were moved from Central Park to Veteran's Park.

To find the number of trash cans now in Veteran's Park, we add the 24 trash cans it already had to the 16 trash cans that were moved from Central Park. So, the total number of trash cans in Veteran's Park is 24 + 16 = 40.

Answer: 40
