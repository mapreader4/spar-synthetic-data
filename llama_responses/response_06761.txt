Let's break it down step by step.

Jill watched a show that was 30 minutes long. 30 minutes is the same as 30 * 1. 

Then, she watched another show that was 4 times as long. 4 times 30 is 4 * 30. 

So, the total number of minutes she spent watching shows is 30 + 4 * 30. 30 + 120 is 150.

Answer: 150
