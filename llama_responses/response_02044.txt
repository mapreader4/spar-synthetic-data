Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with what we know:

* Garret is now 12 years old.
* Shane is 20 years older than Garret was 2 times older.

To find Shane's age, we can set up an equation.

Let's start by finding out how old Garret was 2 times older than Shane. If Garret is now 12, and Shane is 2 times older than him, then Shane must be 12 / 2 = 6 years old when Garret was 0 years old.

So, Shane is now 20 years older than Garret was 6 years old. So, to find Shane's current age, we can add 20 years to 6 years to get his current age.

Answer: 6 + 20 = 26
