Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Levi has 5 lemons.
* Jayden has 6 more lemons than Levi, which means Jayden has 5 + 6 = 11 lemons.
* Eli has one-third as many lemons as Ian has, which means Eli has 2/3 * Ian's lemons. We don't know how many lemons Ian has, but we can find that out later.
* Eli has one-half as many lemons as Ian has, which means Eli has 1/2 * Ian's lemons. Since we don't know how many lemons Ian has, we can't find the exact number yet, but we can represent it as x.
* So, we can write the equation: 2/3 * x = 1/2 * Ian's lemons.
* We know that Eli has 2/3 * x lemons. We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 3/2: 2/3 * x = 1/2 * Ian's lemons * 3/2 = 1/2 * Ian's lemons.
* Solving for x, we get x = 3/4 * Ian's lemons.
* We know that Eli has 2/3 * 3/4 * Ian's lemons = 1/2 * 3/4 * Ian's lemons.
* We can simplify the fraction 1/2 * 3/4 to 3/4 * 1/2 = 3/8.
* So, Eli has 3/8 * 3/4 * Ian's lemons = 3/8 * Ian's lemons.
* We can add up the lemons: Levi has 5, Jayden has 11, Eli has 3/8 * Ian's lemons = 3/8 * Ian's lemons, to get a total of 5 + 11 + 3/8 * Ian's lemons.
* 5 + 11 + 3/8 * Ian's lemons = 16 + 3/8 * Ian's lemons.
* 16 + 3/8 * Ian's lemons = 16 + 9/8 * Ian's lemons.
* 16 + 9/8 * Ian's lemons = 16 + 9 = 25.

So, the answer is: Answer: 25
