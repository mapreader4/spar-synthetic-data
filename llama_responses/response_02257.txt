Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of jelly beans. There are 4,000 jelly beans.

Let's find out how many jelly beans are red. Three fourths of the jelly beans are red. Three fourths of 4,000 is 3,000. So, there are 3,000 red jelly beans.

Now, let's find out how many of these 3,000 red jelly beans are coconut flavored. One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. One quarter of 3,000 is 750. So, there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans.

So, the answer is 750.
