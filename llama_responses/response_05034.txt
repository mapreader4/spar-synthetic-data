To find the free time, we need to subtract the time spent working, exercising, and sleeping from the total 24 hours in a day. 

Jackie has 24 hours in a day. 

Time spent working: 8 hours
Time spent exercising: 3 hours
Time spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total time spent: 8 + 3 + 8 = 19

Subtracting 19 from 24, we get:

24 - 19 = 5

So, Jackie has 5 hours of free time.
