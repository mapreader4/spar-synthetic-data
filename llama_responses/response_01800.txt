Let's break down the information given:

* Madeline has 2 mistakes.
* Leo has half as many mistakes as Madeline, so Leo has 2 / 2 = 1 mistake.
* Brent has 1 more mistake than Leo, so Brent has 1 + 1 = 2 mistakes.
* Brent has 25, and has 2 mistakes, so 25 / 2 = 12.5, so Brent's score is 12.

So, Madeline's score is 2.
