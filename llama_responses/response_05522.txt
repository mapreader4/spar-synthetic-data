Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of sweet potatoes Mrs. Lacson harvested. She harvested 80 sweet potatoes.

Then, she sold 20 of them to Mrs. Adams. This means we subtract 20 from the 80 sweet potatoes she harvested. So, we get:

80 - 20 = 60

Then, she sold 15 of them to Mr. Lenon. We subtract 15 from the 60 sweet potatoes that are left:

60 - 15 = 45

So, the number of sweet potatoes that are not yet sold is 45.

Answer: 45
