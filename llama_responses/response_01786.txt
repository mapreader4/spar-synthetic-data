Let's start by identifying the number of eggs. We know that half the purple eggs have 5 pieces of candy each, so that is 5 * 1/2 = 2.5. Then, 1/4 of the eggs are purple, which is 1/4 * 2.5 = 0.625. The remaining eggs are blue, and 4/5 of those have 1 piece of candy each, which is 4 * 1 = 4. The total number of eggs that have 1 piece of candy is 0.625 + 4 = 4.5. There are 4.5 - 2.5 = 1.5 eggs that have 5 pieces of candy. So, the chance of Jerry getting 5 pieces of candy is 1.5 / 4.5 = 1/3. Answer: 1/3.
