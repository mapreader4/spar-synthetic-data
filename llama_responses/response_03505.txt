Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that 50% of the students chose dogs and video games as their two answers. To find the number of students who chose this combination, we can multiply the total number of students (30) by the percentage (50%):

30 x 0.5 = 15

So, 15 students chose dogs and video games.

Next, we know that 10% of the students chose dogs and movies as their two answers. Again, we can multiply the total number of students by the percentage to find the number of students who chose this combination:

30 x 0.1 = 3

So, 3 students chose dogs and movies.

Now, we need to add the number of students who chose dogs and video games (15) to the number of students who chose dogs and movies (3) to find the total number of students who prefer dogs over cats:

15 + 3 = 18

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 18
