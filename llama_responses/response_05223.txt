Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total amount of money SpongeBob earns from selling burgers.

SpongeBob sells 30 burgers for $2 each. So, the total amount of money he earns from burgers is:

30 x 2 = 60

Next, SpongeBob sells 12 large fries for $1.5 each. So, the total amount of money he earns from fries is:

12 x 1.5 = 18

Now, let's add the total amount of money SpongeBob earns from burgers and fries together:

60 + 18 = 78

So, SpongeBob earns a total of 78 dollars for the day.
