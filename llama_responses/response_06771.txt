Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many pull-ups Mike does in one day. He goes into his office 5 times a day, and each time he does 2 pull-ups. So, the total number of pull-ups he does in one day is 5 x 2 = 10.

Now, we need to find out how many pull-ups he does in a week. Since Mike does this for 7 days a week, the total number of pull-ups he does in a week is 7 x 10 = 70.

So, the answer is: Answer: 70
