Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Count the number of legs of the spiders.
Spiders have 8 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs of the spiders is 8 x 8 = 64.

Step 2: Count the number of legs of the ants.
Ants have 12 ants, and each ant has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs of the ants is 12 x 6 = 72.

Step 3: Add the total number of legs of the spiders and ants together.
The total number of legs of the spiders is 64, and the total number of legs of the ants is 72. So, the total number of legs of the entire collection is 64 + 72 = 136.

Answer: 136
