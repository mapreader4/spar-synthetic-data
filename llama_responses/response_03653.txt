Let's think step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of decorations. Mrs. Jackson has 4 boxes, and each box has 15 decorations. So, the total number of decorations is 4 x 15 = 60.

Since she used 35 decorations, we need to find out how many decorations she gave to her neighbor. To do this, we can subtract the number of decorations used from the total number of decorations.

60 (total decorations) - 35 (used decorations) =?

Let's do the subtraction.

60 - 35 = 25

Answer: 25
