Let's break down the cost of the items Emily purchased:

* 2 pairs of curtains for $30.00 each: 2 x 30.00 = 60.00
* 9 wall prints for $15.00 each: 9 x 15.00 = 135.00
Total cost of the items: 60.00 + 135.00 = 195.00

Now, let's consider the installation service. The cost of the installation service is $50.00. If Emily agrees to this service, the total cost will be the sum of the total cost of the items plus the cost of the service, which is:
195.00 + 50.00 = 245.00

So, the answer is:

Answer: 245
