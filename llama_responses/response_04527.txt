Let's break this down step by step.

Emma spent $58. Elsa spent twice as much as Emma, which is 2 x $58 = $116. Elizabeth spent four times as much as Elsa, which is 4 x $116 = $464. To find the total amount spent by all three, we add their individual amounts together: $58 + $116 + $464 = $638. Answer: 638.
