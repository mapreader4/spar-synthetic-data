To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the movie theater makes.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money made from matinee tickets: 200 tickets at $5 each will be 200 * 5 = $1000.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money made from evening tickets: 300 tickets at $12 each will be 300 * 12 = $3600.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money made from 3D tickets: 100 tickets at $20 each will be 100 * 20 = $2000.

Now, we add the total amount of money made from each type of ticket:

$1000 + $3600 + $2000 = $4600.

Answer: 4600
