Let's break it down step by step.

Sarah starts with 5 pounds of rye flour, 10 pounds of whole-wheat bread flour, and 3 pounds of chickpea flour. That is a total of 5 + 10 + 3 = 18 pounds of flour.

Sarah already has 2 pounds of whole-wheat pastry flour at home. We add this to the total, so the total amount of flour Sarah has is 18 + 2 = 20 pounds of flour.
