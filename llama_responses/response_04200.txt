Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find out how many mangoes Dilan and Ashley have.

Let's assume Dilan has x mangoes. Then, we can set up an equation.

Dilan has 2x mangoes.

Now, we can set up an equation for the total number of mangoes that Dilan and Ashley have.

2x + x = 60

Since we know Dilan has 60 mangoes, we can substitute 60 in for x.

2x + 60 = 60

2x = 30

Now we can find out how many mangoes Ashley has.

Ashley has 30 mangoes.

Now we can find out how many mangoes Dilan and Ashley have combined.

Dilan has 30 mangoes, and Ashley has 30 mangoes. So, we can add the two together.

30 + 30 = 60

So, the total number of mangoes Dilan and Ashley have combined is 60.

Answer: 60
