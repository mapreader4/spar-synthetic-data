To find the amount Mark should add, we can set up a proportion. We know that Mark wants to tip 20% of the $200 check, and his friend is kicking in $10. We can set up the proportion as a proportion. We can set up the proportion as a fraction: 20/100 = x/200. To solve for x, we can cross multiply the 20 and 100, and then divide by 200: x = 20/100 * 200 / 200 = 4. So Mark should add $4 to the check.
