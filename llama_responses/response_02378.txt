Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find the cost of the Lego blocks: 3 sets of Lego blocks at $250 each would cost 3 x 250 = $750.

Next, let's find the cost of the toy swords: 7 toy swords at $120 each would cost 7 x 120 = $840.

Next, let's find the cost of the play dough: 10 play doughs at $35 each would cost 10 x 35 = $350.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $750 (Lego) + $840 (swords) + $350 (play dough) = $1940.

Answer: 1940
