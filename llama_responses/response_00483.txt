Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Andy started the year weighing 156 pounds. So, his initial weight is 156 pounds.

Step 2: He gained 36 pounds, so his new weight is 156 + 36 = 192 pounds.

Step 3: Over the next 3 months, he lost an eighth of his weight every month. So, he lost 36 / 8 = 4.5 pounds each month.

Step 4: Since he lost 4.5 pounds each month for 3 months, he lost a total of 4.5 * 3 = 13.5 pounds.

Step 5: So, his final weight is 192 - 13.5 = 178.5 pounds.

Answer: 178.5
