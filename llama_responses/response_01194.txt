Let's break it down step by step.

Vincent has 72 inches of rope. He cuts it into 12 equal length pieces, so each piece is 72/12 = 6 inches long. Then, he ties 3 of them together, making each piece 6 - 3 = 3 inches long. Then, he makes each piece 1 inch shorter, so each piece is 3 - 1 = 2 inches long.

So, the length of each piece of rope is 2 inches.
