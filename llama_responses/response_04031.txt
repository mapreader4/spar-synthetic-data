Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say each bucket can hold a certain number of strawberries. Let's call this number x.

Since Cheryl took 20 strawberries from each bucket, we know that the total number of strawberries taken is 20 * 5 = 100.

The total number of strawberries initially in each bucket is 300 - 100 = 200.

So, the number of strawberries left in each bucket is 200 รท 5 = 40.

Answer: 40
