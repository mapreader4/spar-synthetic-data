Let's start by letting x be the age of the granddaughter. Since the granddaughter is one-third the mother's age, we can write the equation:

x = (1/3) * mother's age.

Since the mother is 40 years younger than Betty, the mother's age is 60 - 40 = 20. So, the equation becomes:

x = (1/3) * 20.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = (1/3) * 20 * 3 = 20.

So, the granddaughter is 20 years old.
