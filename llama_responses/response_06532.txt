Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the younger son's current age is x.

Since the difference in age between the elder son and the younger son is 10 years, the elder son's age minus the younger son's age is 10. So, we can set up an equation:

40 - x = 10

We can solve for x:

40 - x = 10

x = 30

So, the younger son is currently 30 years old.

Now, if we want to know how old the younger son will be 30 years from now, we need to add 30 to his current age:

30 + 30 =?

Answer: 60
