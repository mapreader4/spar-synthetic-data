Let's break this down step by step:

Let's first find out how many pencils Judy uses in a day. She uses 10 pencils in 5 days. To find out how many pencils she uses in a day, we can divide the total pencils used by the number of days.

10 pencils in 5 days is 10 / 5 = 2 pencils per day.

Next, we need to find out how much she spends on pencils over 45 days. To do this, we need to multiply the pencils used per day by the number of days.

2 pencils per day * 45 days = 90 pencils.

Finally, we need to find out how much she spends on pencils. Each pack of pencils costs $4. To find out how much she spends on pencils, we can multiply the number of pencils by the cost of a pack.

90 pencils * $4 = $360.

Answer: 360
