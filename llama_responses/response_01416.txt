To find the average words per minute, we need to add up the number of words each person types and then divide by the number of people.

First, let's add up the number of words each person types per minute:

Rudy types 64 words per minute.
Joyce types 76 words per minute.
Gladys types 91 words per minute.
Lisa types 80 words per minute.
Mike types 89 words per minute.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

64 + 76 + 91 + 80 + 89 = 320

There are 5 people in the team. To find the average, we divide the sum by 5:

320 / 5 = 64

Answer: 64
