Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages to be copied.
The manuscript is 400 pages. Since Clarissa wants to get 10 copies, we need to multiply the number of pages by 10.
10 * 400 = 4000 pages

Step 2: Calculate the cost of copying the pages.
The cost per page is $0.05, so for 4000 pages, the total cost would be:
4000 * 0.05 = 200

Step 3: Calculate the cost of binding the manuscript.
The cost per manuscript is $5.00, and Clarissa wants to get 10 copies. So, the total cost would be:
10 * 5.00 = 50

Step 4: Add the cost of copying and binding together.
The total cost would be the sum of the cost of copying and binding:
200 + 50 = 250

Answer: 250
