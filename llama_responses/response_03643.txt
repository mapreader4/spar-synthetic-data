Let's start by adding the number of chairs for the indoor tables. There are 8 tables with 3 chairs each, so that is 8 x 3 = 24 chairs. Then we add the number of chairs for the outdoor tables, which is 12 tables with 3 chairs each, which is 12 x 3 = 36 chairs. We add the number of chairs from both indoor and outdoor tables, so we get 24 + 36 = 60 chairs.

Answer: 60
