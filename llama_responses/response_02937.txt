Let's start by finding the total number of students. Since 40% are girls, that means 60% are boys. Let's call the total number of students "x". We can set up an equation:

40% of x = number of girls
60% of x = number of boys

We know that the number of boys is equal to the total number of students minus the number of girls, so we can set up another equation:

60% of x = x - 40% of x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.6x = 0.4x
0.2x = 0
x = 0.4/0.2
x = 20

So, there are 20 students in total. Since there are 8 monitors, and 2 monitors for every 15 students, we can set up an equation:

8 = 2x/15
8*15 = 2x
120 = 2x
x = 120/2
x = 60

However, we already found that x = 20, not 60. This is because we made an assumption earlier that 2 monitors for every 15 students was true, but this is not the case. Since there are only 8 monitors, we can divide 8 by 2 to find the actual number of students per monitor:

8/2 = 4

So, there are 4 students per monitor. Since 2 monitors are present, we can multiply the number of students per monitor by 2 to find the total number of students:

4*2 = 8

This matches our earlier answer of 20 students. Now, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 40% are girls, and 60% are boys. We can multiply the total number of students by these percentages to find the number of girls and boys:

Girls: 20*0.4 = 8
Boys: 20*0.6 = 12

Now, let's find the total number of cartons of milk consumed. Every boy drinks 1 carton of milk, so the total number of cartons consumed by boys is:

12*1 = 12

Every girl drinks 2 cartons of milk, so the total number of cartons consumed by girls is:

8*2 = 16

The total number of cartons consumed is the sum of the cartons consumed by boys and girls:

12 + 16 = 28

Answer: 28
