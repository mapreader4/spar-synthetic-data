Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Chandler has already sold 3 rolls to his grandmother, 4 rolls to his uncle, and 3 rolls to a neighbor. This means that the total number of rolls sold is 3 + 4 + 3 = 10. Since he needs to sell 12 rolls in total, we can find the difference between the total number of rolls needed and the number of rolls already sold. The difference is 12 - 10 = 2. Therefore, Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.
