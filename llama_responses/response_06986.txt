Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the distance that Briar needs to travel. The event is 200 miles away from his home.

Next, we need to find the total distance Briar needs to travel to and from the event, since it is a round trip. The total distance is 200 miles to the event, so the total distance is 2 x 200 = 400 miles.

Now, we know that the cab ride costs $2.5 per mile. To find the total cost of the cab rides, we multiply the total distance by the cost per mile. So, the total cost is 400 miles x $2.5 per mile = $10.00.
