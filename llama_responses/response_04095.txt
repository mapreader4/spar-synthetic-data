Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes.
2. Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar. So, Polly stands on her back legs for 3 x 10 = 30 minutes.
3. Petra stands on her back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly. So, Petra stands on her back legs for 30/6 = 5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time each entertainer spends standing on their back legs:

Pulsar: 10 minutes
Polly: 30 minutes
Petra: 5 minutes

Total time: 10 + 30 + 5 = 45 minutes

Answer: 45
