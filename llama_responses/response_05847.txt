To find Ursula's annual salary, we need to calculate the total number of hours she works in a month and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

Ursula works 8 hours a day, and there are 20 days in a month. So, the total number of hours she works in a month is:

8 hours/day * 20 days = 160 hours

Now, we multiply this by her hourly wage to get her monthly salary:

160 hours * $8.50 = $1360

So, Ursula's annual salary is $1360.
