Let's break this down step by step:

Let's let x be the age of Karina's brother.

We know that Karina is currently 40 years old, so we know that 2x = 40.

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

2x = 40

x = 40 / 2

x = 20

So, her brother was born in 1970 + 20 = 1990.

Answer: 1990
