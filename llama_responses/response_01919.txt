Let's break down the problem step by step.

The house cost 100,000 dollars. 20% of 100,000 is 20,000. So, after paying 20,000, the remaining balance is 80,000.

Then, his parents paid off 30% of the remaining balance. 30% of 80,000 is 24,000. So, the remaining balance is 56,000.

Roger still owes 56,000. 

Answer: 56000
