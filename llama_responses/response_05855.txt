Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be the number of gummy worms in the bag when Carlos bought it.

Since Carlos ate half of the gummy worms every day, we can say that after the first day, he ate x / 2 gummy worms. The number of gummy worms left is x - (x / 2). Then, on the second day, he ate half of the remainder, which is (x - (x / 2)) / 2 = (x - x / 2) / 2. Then, on the third day, he ate half of the remainder, which is ((x - (x / 2)) / 2) / 2 = ((x - x / 2) / 2) / 2. And on the fourth day, he ate half of the remainder, which is (((x - (x / 2)) / 2) / 2) / 2 = (((x - x / 2) / 2) / 2) / 2.

Now, on the fourth day, he has 4 gummy worms left. So, we can set up the equation:

((x - x / 2) / 2) / 2) / 2 = 4.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

((x - x / 2) / 2) / 2) / 2) / 4 = x / 16.

Now, we can multiply both sides by 16:

x / 16 = 4.

x = 64.

Answer: 64
