Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of the cheddar cheese. Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. So, the cost of the cheddar cheese is $10.

Next, the pound of cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, so the cost of the cream cheese is half of $10, which is $5.

The pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so the cost of the cold cuts is twice $10, which is $20.

To find the total cost of the ingredients, we add the cost of the cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and cold cuts together. This is $10 + $5 + $20, which is $35.

Answer: 35
