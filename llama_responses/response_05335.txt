Let's break down the information:

On Tuesday, Max got $8.

On Wednesday, his mom gave him 5 times as much money as she gave him on Tuesday, so she gave him 5 * 8 = $40.

On Thursday, his mom gave him $9 more in money than she gave him on Wednesday, so she gave him $40 + 9 = $49.

To find the difference between what his mom gave him on Thursday and Tuesday, we subtract the amount she gave him on Tuesday from the amount she gave him on Thursday:

$49 - $8 = $41.

Answer: 41
