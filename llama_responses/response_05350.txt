Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of orange marbles Katie has. We know that she has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. So, we can say that the number of orange marbles is 13 - 9, which is equal to 4.

Since Katie has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles, we can say that the number of purple marbles is 4 times the number of orange marbles. So, the number of purple marbles is 4 * 4, which is equal to 16.

To find the total number of marbles Katie has, we add the number of pink marbles, orange marbles, and purple marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 13 + 4 + 16, which is equal to 33.

Answer: 33.
