Let's break this down step by step.

Molly and her parents started with some people at the beach. Then, 40 people left the beach at 5:00. We can subtract 40 from the initial number of people to find the number of people who stayed until the end of the day.

Let's subtract 40 from 100:

100 - 40 = 60

Answer: 60
