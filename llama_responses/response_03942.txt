Let's break down the problem step by step.

The firefighter is paid $30 per hour for a 48-hour workweek, so his weekly income is:

30 * 48 = 1440

The firefighter's monthly income is:

1440 * 4 = 5760

The firefighter pays 1/3 of his income on rent, which is:

5760 * 1/3 = 1920

The firefighter pays $500 on food, which is a fixed amount, so we subtract that from his income:

5760 - 500 = 5320

The firefighter pays $1000 on taxes, which is a fixed amount, so we subtract that from his income:

5320 - 1000 = 4320

The firefighter has a monthly income of 5760, and after paying his expenses, he has:

4320

Answer: 4320
