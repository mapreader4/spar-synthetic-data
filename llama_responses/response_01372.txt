Let's break it down into smaller units of time. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, in an hour, Micah can type 20 words per minute, so he can type 20 * 60 = 1200 words. Isaiah can type 40 words per minute, so he can type 40 * 60 = 2400 words.

To find the difference, we subtract 1200 from 2400, and we get 1200. Therefore, Isaiah can type 1200 more words than Micah in an hour.
