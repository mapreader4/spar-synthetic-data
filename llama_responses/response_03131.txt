Let's break this problem down step by step.

George paid $16 for the ticket, which is the first part of the total cost. Then, the nachos were half the price of the ticket, so the cost of the nachos is half of 16, which is 8. So, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the ticket and the nachos, which is 16 + 8, which is 24.

Answer: 24
