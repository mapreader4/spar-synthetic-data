Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start with the side shared with the neighbor who agreed to pay for half of the shared side. Since the neighbor is paying for half of the side, the neighbor's share is half of the side. The length of the side is 18 feet. Half of 18 is 9. So the neighbor's share of the side is 9 feet, and the cost of the side is 9 x 3 = 27. Cole has to pay for the other two sides, which are the sides shared with the neighbor on his left and the back. The length of the sides is 9 feet, and the cost is 2 sides, so the total cost for Cole is 2 x 9 x 3 = 18. Then, we need to add the cost of the side shared with the neighbor who agreed to pay for a third of the shared side. The neighbor's share is a third of the side, so the neighbor's share is a third of the side. A third of 18 is 6, so the neighbor's share is 6 feet, and the cost of the side is 6 x 3 = 18. So the total cost of the fence for Cole is 18 + 18 = 36. Since the neighbor is paying for a third of the side, we need to subtract the neighbor's share from the total cost. The total cost minus the neighbor's share is 36 - 6 = 30. The answer is 30.
