Let's break this problem down step by step.

John has 3 half-full decks of cards. A half-full deck of cards means it has 26 cards (since a full deck has 52 cards). So, John has 3 x 26 = 78 cards from the half-full decks.

He also has 3 full decks of cards, which is 3 x 52 = 156 cards.

In total, John has 78 + 156 = 234 cards.

After throwing away 34 cards, John is left with:

234 - 34 = 200

Answer: 200
