Let's start by finding the age of Bella when Marianne was 20 years old. We know that Bella is 8 years younger than Marianne when Marianne was 20 years old, so Bella must have been 20 - 8 = 12 years old. So, to find the age of Marianne when Bella turns 18, we subtract 12 from 20 to get the answer. 20 - 12 = 8. So, Marianne will be 8 + 10 = 18 years old when Bella turns 18.
