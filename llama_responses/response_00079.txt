Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with James, who has been teaching for 40 years. We know that James's teaching experience is 40.

James's partner has been teaching for 10 years less than James. This means that James's partner has been teaching for 40 - 10 = 30 years.

So, the combined experience of James and his partner is 40 + 30 = 70 years.

Answer: 70
