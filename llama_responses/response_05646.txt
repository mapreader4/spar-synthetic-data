Let's break down the number of days into smaller units. Steve reads the book on 3 days, which means there are 3 days of reading.

To find out how many pages Steve reads each day, we can divide the total number of pages (2100) by the number of days (3):

2100 รท 3 = 700

So, Steve reads 700 pages each day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the number of pages per day by the number of days in a week to find the number of weeks:

700 รท 7 = 100

Answer: 100
