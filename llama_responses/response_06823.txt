Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Mr. Smith has 86 markers in total. We know that each box has 9 markers. So, we can divide 86 markers by 9 to find out how many boxes he bought.

86 รท 9 = 9.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number, Mr. Smith bought 9 boxes.
