Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the total amount of pay, which is $650. We know that Jeb has to pay 10% of that as tax, so we can subtract the tax from the total pay to find his take-home pay.

To do this, we can set up an equation: 10% of $650 =? = 0.10 * $650.

To solve for the unknown, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10, to get: $650 = 0.10 * x. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.10, to get: x = 650 / 0.10 = 6500.00.

x = 6500.00.

Answer: 650.
