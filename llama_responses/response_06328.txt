Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of the second suit. The second suit costs 3 times the cost of the first suit, which is $300, and then an extra $200 for tailoring. So, the cost of the second suit is 3 x $300 + $200 = $900.

Now, to find the total cost of both suits, we need to add the cost of the first suit to the cost of the second suit. The total cost is $300 (for the first suit) + $900 (for the second suit) = $1200.

Answer: 1200
