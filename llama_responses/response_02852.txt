Let's start by calculating the total amount of sodium in the recipe without reducing the parmesan cheese. The recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of salt, which has 2 x 50 mg = 100 mg of sodium. The recipe also calls for 8 oz of parmesan cheese, which has 8 x 25 mg = 200 mg of sodium. The total amount of sodium is 100 mg + 200 mg = 300 mg.

James wants to reduce the total amount of sodium by 1/3rd, which is 300 mg / 3 = 100 mg. To reduce the sodium in the parmesan cheese, he needs to reduce it by 100 mg. Since each ounce of parmesan cheese has 25 mg of sodium, he needs to reduce it by 100 mg / 25 mg per ounce = 4 ounces.
