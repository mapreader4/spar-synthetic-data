Let's start by identifying the total points scored by both players.

Let's say the total points scored by both players is x. Vlad and Taro scored a total of 30 points in 30 rounds.

We know that Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points, so we can write the equation: x - 4 = 3x/5.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get: 5x - 20 = 3x.

Next, we can add 20 to both sides to get: 5x = 23.

Answer: 23
