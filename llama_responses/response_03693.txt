To find the percentage of Wendy's life that she spent in an accounting-related job, we need to find the number of years she spent in an accounting job and divide it by the total number of years she lived.

The number of years Wendy spent in an accounting job is the sum of the number of years she spent as an accountant and the number of years she spent as an accounting manager. This is 25 + 15 = 40.

The total number of years Wendy lived is 80.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of years she spent in an accounting job by the total number of years she lived:

(40 / 80) * 100% = 50%

Answer: 50
