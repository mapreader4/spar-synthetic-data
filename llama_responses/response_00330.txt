To find the number of people who will attend the wedding, we can multiply 220 by 0.95 to get the number of people who typically attend, then subtract 5% of that number. We can set up an equation to solve this problem as follows:

Let x be the number of people who will attend the wedding. Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

x = 220 * 0.95 - (0.05 * 220)

We can solve this equation by multiplying 220 by 0.95, which gives us:

x = 209

So, the answer is:

Answer: 209
