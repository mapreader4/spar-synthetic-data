First, let's find the total cost of the items. The shoes cost 1 x 74 dollars, the 2 pairs of socks cost 2 x 2 = 4 dollars, and the bag costs 1 x 42 = 42 dollars. The total cost is 74 + 4 + 42 = 120. The 10% discount is for 100 - 120 = 20. So the final cost is 100 - 20 = 80. The answer is: Answer: 80.
