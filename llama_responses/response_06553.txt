Let's break this down step by step:

On Monday, Elois makes 3 loaves of banana bread. Each loaf requires 4 bananas. So, she uses 3 x 4 = 12 bananas on Monday.

On Tuesday, she makes twice as many loaves of banana bread as Monday. So, she makes 3 x 2 = 6 loaves of banana bread on Tuesday.

In total, she makes 3 + 6 = 9 loaves of banana bread. Since each loaf requires 4 bananas, she uses 9 x 4 = 36 bananas in total.

Answer: 36
