Let's start by letting x be the number of toys that Mr. Desmond bought for his younger son.

Since the problem states that Mr. Desmond bought three times as many toys for his younger son as he bought for his elder son, this means that Mr. Desmond bought 3x toys for his younger son.

Since Mr. Desmond bought 60 toys for his elder son, we know that the number of toys he bought for his younger son is 3 times the number of toys he bought for his elder son. So, if we let x be the number of toys for his younger son, we can write an equation to represent this relationship:

3x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 60 / 3

x = 20

Answer: 20
