Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the number of students who got a full merit college scholarship: 5% of the 300 students, which is 15 students. Let's also identify the number of students who got a half merit scholarship: 10% of the 300 students, which is 30 students.

The number of students who did not get any scholarships is the difference between the total number of students and the number of students who got a full or half merit scholarship. The total number of students is 300, and the number of students who got a full or half merit scholarship is 15 + 30 = 45. So, the number of students who did not get any scholarships is 300 - 45 = 255. 

Answer: 255.
