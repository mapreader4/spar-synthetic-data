Let's break this down step by step.

The cost of the movie ticket on a Monday is $5.
The cost of the movie ticket on a Wednesday is twice as much, which is 2 x $5 = $10.
The cost of the movie ticket on a Saturday is five times as much as the Monday ticket, which is 5 x $5 = $25.

The total cost of the movie tickets is the sum of these costs, so it is $5 + $10 + $25 = $40.

Answer: 40
