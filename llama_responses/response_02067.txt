Let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that each student needs at least $450. Since there are 6 students, the total amount needed is 6 x $450 = $2700.

Additionally, they need $3000 for miscellaneous expenses. So, the total amount needed is $2700 + $3000 = $5700.

Now, let's calculate the amount they've raised so far:

Day 1: $600
Day 2: $900
Day 3: $400
Total: $600 + $900 + $400 = $1900

For the next 4 days, they receive only half of what they raised on the first 3 days, which is:

$1900 / 2 = $950

So, they receive $950 for the next 4 days. The total amount raised so far is:

$1900 + $950 = $2850

Now, let's calculate how much more they need to raise:

Total needed: $5700
Amount raised: $2850
Amount still needed: $5700 - $2850 = $2850

Since there are 6 students, each student needs to raise:

$2850 / 6 = $475

Answer: 475
