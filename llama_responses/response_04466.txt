Let's break this problem down step by step.

Lucas has to clean 3 windows per floor, and there are 3 floors, so he has to clean a total of 3 x 3 = 9 windows.

His father will pay him $2 for each window, so the total amount of money he will get from cleaning all the windows is 9 x 2 = 18 dollars.

However, his father will subtract $1 for every 3 days that pass without Lucas finishing the job. Lucas takes 6 days to finish the job, so he will be paid 2 times for every 3 days that pass. 2 x 1 = 2.

So, the amount of money he will be paid is 18 - 2 = 16.

Answer: 16
