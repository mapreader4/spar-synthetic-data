Let's break this down step by step.

1. Ahmed is 11 years old.
2. Fouad is 26 years old.
3. We want to know when Fouad's age will be double Ahmed's age.
4. Ahmed's age is 11 years.
5. To get Fouad's age to be double Ahmed's age, we need to multiply Fouad's current age by 2.
6. Fouad's age is 26 years. So, 2 x 26 = 52.
7. So, in 52 years, Fouad's age will be double Ahmed's current age.

Answer: 52
