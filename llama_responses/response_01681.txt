Let's break this down step by step.

1. 1 bottle of car wash soap can wash the car 4 times.
2. 1 bottle of car wash soap costs 4.00.
3. Jake washes the car once a week for 20 weeks.
4. 20 weeks is 20 x 1 = 20.
5. 1 bottle of car wash soap is used 4 times in 1 wash, and 1 bottle costs 4.00.
6. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of times the car wash is washed (20) by the cost of the car wash soap per wash (4.00). 20 x 4.00 = 80.

Answer: 80
