Let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total number of people being served by the 6 shelters. Since each shelter serves 30 people, the total number of people being served is 6 x 30 = 180.

2. Next, we need to find the total number of cans of soup Mark donates. Since Mark donates 10 cans of soup per person, the total number of cans of soup Mark donates is 180 x 10 = 1800.

Answer: 1800
