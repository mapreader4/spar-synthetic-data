Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information.

* Rob has 24 baseball cards.
* One third of Rob's cards are doubles.
* Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob.

Let's identify the number of doubles Rob has. Since one third of Rob's cards are doubles, and Rob has 24 cards, the number of doubles Rob has is 24 / 3 = 8.

Now, let's find the number of doubles Jess has. Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob, so Jess has 8 * 5 = 40 doubles.

Answer: 40
