Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of items on the math quiz is x.

Louie got 80% of the items correct. That means that 80% of x is equal to 80.

We can set up an equation to represent this.

0.8x = 80

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.8.

x = 100

So, the total number of items on the math quiz is 100.

Answer: 100
