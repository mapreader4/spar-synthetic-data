Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that the adoption fee is $50. So, that's one cost that Jenny has to pay.

Next, we know that the vet visits cost $500 for the first year. So, that's another cost that Jenny has to pay.

Then, we know that the monthly cost of food is $25. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of food for the year is 12 x $25 = $300.

Finally, we know that Jenny bought $200 in toys. So, we need to add this to the total cost.

So, let's add up all the costs:

$50 (adoption fee) + $500 (vet visits) + $300 (food) + $200 (toys) =?

Answer: $850
