Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total number of people in Andrew's family is 4 (2 parents and 2 siblings).

2. The total number of masks needed per person is 100 / 4 = 25 masks per person.

3. Since the family members change masks every 4 days, the number of days needed to finish the pack is 25 masks / 25 masks per person = 1 day.

4. However, since there are 4 people in the family, the total number of days needed to finish the pack is 1 day * 4 = 4 days.

Answer: 4
