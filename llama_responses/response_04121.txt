Let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we know that 20% of the bottles of milk are spoiled. This means that 80% of the bottles of milk are fresh. 80% of the milk is fresh.

2. Next, we know that 60% of the eggs are rotten. This means that 40% of the eggs are not rotten. 40% of the eggs are not rotten.

3. Now, let's find the probability of Jackson picking a bottle of milk. Since 80% of the milk is fresh, the probability of picking a fresh bottle of milk is 80%.

4. Next, let's find the probability of Jackson picking an egg. Since 40% of the eggs are not rotten, the probability of picking a non-rotten egg is 40%.

5. Finally, let's find the probability of Jackson picking a canister of flour. Since 1/4 of the canisters of flour have weevils in them, the probability of picking a canister with weevils is 25%.

6. To find the probability of all three ingredients being good, we multiply the probabilities of each. The probability of Jackson picking a fresh bottle of milk, a non-rotten egg and a canister of flour without weevils is:

80% x 40% x 25% = 0.32

Answer: 0.32
