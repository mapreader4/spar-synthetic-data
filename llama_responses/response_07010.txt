Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the potato chips:

3 bags of potato chips at $1.00 each is 3 x $1.00 = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the creme fraiche:

The creme fraiche costs $5.00 and is dolloped on each chip, but we're serving 3 people, so the total amount of creme fraiche used is not relevant to the cost per person. We can ignore this cost for now.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the caviar:

The caviar costs $73.00.

Finally, let's add up the costs:

Total cost of potato chips: $3.00
Total cost of caviar: $73.00

Total cost of the appetizer: $3.00 + $73.00 = $76.00

Since the appetizer will serve 3 people, we can divide the total cost by 3 to find the cost per person:

$76.00 รท 3 = $25.33
