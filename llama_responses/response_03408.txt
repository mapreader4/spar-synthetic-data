Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of electricity for the old computer. The old computer used 800 watts and the old price of electricity was 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, so the cost for the old computer was:

800 watts * 12 cents/kilowatt-hour = 9.6 dollars per hour

Now, we need to find the cost for the new computer. The new computer uses 50% more than the old computer, so it uses 1.2 times as much electricity. Therefore, the cost for the new computer is:

1.2 * 9.6 dollars per hour = 11.52 dollars per hour

Finally, to find the cost for 50 hours, we multiply the cost by 50:

11.52 dollars per hour * 50 hours = 576.00 dollars

Answer: 576
