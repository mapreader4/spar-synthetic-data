Let's start by using the information given to create an equation.

Let's say the number of cows is x.

The problem states that they have three fewer than twice as many cows as pigs, so we can write that as an equation: x - (2 * 10) = 3.

We are told that there are six more goats than cows, so we can write that as an equation: x + 6.

We know that there are 10 pigs, so we can write that as an equation: x + x = 10.

We can now solve the equations:

x - (2 * 10) = 3
x + x = 10

Subtract 2 * 10 from both sides of the equation x - (2 * 10) = 3 to get:

x = 10 - 6 = 4

So, Hannah's family has 4 animals on their farm.
