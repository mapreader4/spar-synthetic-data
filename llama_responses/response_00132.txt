Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Find the total weight of the beef.
The total weight of the beef is 5 packs x 4 pounds. So, it is 5 x 4 = 20 pounds.

Step 2: Find the price of the beef.
The price of the beef is $5.50 per pound. To find the total price, we multiply the total weight by the price.
So, 20 pounds x $5.50 = 20 x 5.50 = $110.00.

Answer: 110.
