Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many baseball cards Buddy had on Tuesday. He lost half of 30, which is 15. So, he had 15 baseball cards on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he buys 12 baseball cards, so he now has 15 + 12 = 27 baseball cards.

On Thursday, he buys a third of what he had on Tuesday. A third of 27 is 9. So, he buys 9 baseball cards.

So, on Thursday, he has 27 + 9 = 36 baseball cards.

Answer: 36
