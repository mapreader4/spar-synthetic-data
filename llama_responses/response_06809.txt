Let's break it down step by step.

Jerry works for 10 hours a day, so in a week, he works for 10 * 7 = 70 hours. Since each task takes him 2 hours to complete, we know that Jerry does 70 / 2 = 35 tasks in a week. Since each task is paid $40, the total amount of money Jerry would earn is 35 * 40 = $1400.
