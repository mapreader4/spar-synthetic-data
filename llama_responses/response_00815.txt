Let's break this down step by step.

Bingley has 5 bracelets initially.

Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets. So, Bingley gets 16 / 4 = 4 bracelets.

Then, Bingley gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister. A third of 5 bracelets is 5 / 3 = 1.5 bracelets.

Bingley has 5 bracelets initially, then he gives 4 bracelets to his sister, and then he gives 1.5 bracelets to his sister. So, Bingley has 5 - 4 - 1.5 bracelets left.

5 - 4 - 1.5 = 0.5.

Answer: 0.5.
