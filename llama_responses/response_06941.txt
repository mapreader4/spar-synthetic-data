Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of male adults is 60. We know that the total number of people in the church is 200.

We know that the number of female adults is the total number of people minus the number of male adults. So, let's call the number of female adults x.

We can write the equation as follows:

60 (number of male adults) + x (number of female adults) = 200 (total number of people)

We can subtract the number of male adults from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 200 - 60
x = 140

So, the number of female adults is 140.

Answer: 140
