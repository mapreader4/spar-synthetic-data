Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Jonah ran for 2 hours and burned 30 calories per hour. We need to find the total calories burned in 5 hours.

To find the total calories burned in 5 hours, we can multiply the calories burned per hour by the number of hours:

30 calories/hour * 5 hours =?

To multiply, we need to multiply 30 by 5:

30 * 5 = 150

So, Jonah would have burned 150 calories if he would have run for 5 hours.
