Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry spent 8 hours painting the house.
2. The time it took him to fix the broken kitchen counter was three times longer than the time he took painting the house, so he spent 3 x 8 = 24 hours fixing the kitchen counter.
3. Then, he spent 6 hours mowing Miss Stevie's lawn.
4. In total, Jerry spent 8 + 24 + 6 = 38 hours working for Miss Stevie.
5. Since Jerry charges $15 per hour, the total amount he earned is 38 x 15 = 570 dollars.

Answer: 570
