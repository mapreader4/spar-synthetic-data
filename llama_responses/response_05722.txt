Let's break it down step by step:

Mona brought 20 cookies.

Jasmine brought 5 fewer cookies than Mona, so Jasmine brought 20 - 5 = 15 cookies.

Rachel brought 10 more cookies than Jasmine, so Rachel brought 15 + 10 = 25 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies brought by Mona, Jasmine, and Rachel:

20 (Mona) + 15 (Jasmine) + 25 (Rachel) = 60

Answer: 60
