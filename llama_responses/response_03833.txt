Let's start by finding the number of candles Alyssa used. She used half of the 40 candles, so she used 40 / 2 = 20 candles. Then, Chelsea used 70% of the remaining candles. Since 40 - 20 = 20, she used 0.7 * 20 = 14 of the remaining candles. So, the total number of candles left is 20 + 14 = 34. 

Answer: 34
