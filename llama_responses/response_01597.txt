Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by determining how many plumeria flowers it takes to make 1 lei. It takes 2 and half dozen, which is 7, to make 1 lei. So, to make 1 lei, we need 7 plumeria flowers.

Now, to make 4 leis, we need 4 times the amount of plumeria flowers needed for 1 lei. So, we need 7 * 4 = 28 plumeria flowers.

Answer: 28
