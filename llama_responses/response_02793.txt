Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of rows of cookies. Lara is baking four baking trays, and each tray has five rows. So, there are 4 x 5 = 20 rows of cookies in total.

Then, each row has six cookies. So, to find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of rows by the number of cookies per row: 20 x 6 = 120.

Answer: 120
