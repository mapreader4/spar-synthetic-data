Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

1. The video got 4000 views on the first day.
2. After 4 days, the number of views increased by a number ten times more than the views on the first day.
3. 50000 more people viewed the video after another 2 days.

Let's start by finding the number of views after 4 days. We know the number of views increased by a factor of 10, so we can multiply the initial views by 11 (since 10 is 10 times 1).

4000 * 11 = 44000

So, the number of views after 4 days is 44000.

Now, we know that 50000 more people viewed the video after another 2 days. So, we need to add this to the number of views after 4 days.

44000 + 50000 = 94000

Answer: 94000
