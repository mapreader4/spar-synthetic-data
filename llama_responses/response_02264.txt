Let's start by identifying the number of people in each city:

Roseville city has 1000 people.
Willowdale city has 2000 people.

We can set up an equation to represent the number of people in Sun City:

Let x be the number of people in Sun City.

We know that Roseville city has 1000 people, so the number of people in Sun City is 1000 more than that, so:

1000 + x = 1000 + 1000

We know that Willowdale city has 2000 people, and the number of people in Sun City is 500 less than that, so:

2000 - x = 2000 - 500

We can solve for x:

x = 2000 - 500
x = 1500

So, the number of people in Sun City is 1500.

Answer: 1500
