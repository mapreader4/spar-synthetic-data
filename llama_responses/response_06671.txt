Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of women who attended the party. Fifty percent of the attendees are women, which is 50/100 = 50. Since the total number of attendees is 100, the number of women is 50.

Next, let's identify the number of men who attended the party. Thirty-five percent of the attendees are men, which is 35/100 = 35. We already know that the number of women is 50, so the total number of attendees is 50 + 35 = 85.

The number of children is the remaining 100 - 85 = 15. So, the number of children who attended the party is 15.

Answer: 15
