To solve this problem, I will break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Ryan wants to fund a $1,000 business and he already has $200. We are also given that the average person will fund $10 to a project they're interested in.

Let's assume that the average person will fund $10 to a project they're interested in, then the number of people Ryan will need to recruit to fund a $1,000 business is equal to the total amount of money needed to fund the business ($1,000) divided by the amount each person will fund ($10).

To find the number of people Ryan will need to recruit, we can set up the equation as follows:

Number of people = Total amount needed to fund the business / Amount each person will fund

Number of people = $1,000 / $10

To solve for the number of people, we can divide $1,000 by $10:

$1,000 รท $10 = 100

Answer: 100
