To solve this problem, I will first calculate the time it takes to download the first 60 megabytes. This is because it is the first 60 megabytes that download at a rate of 5 megabytes per second.

60 megabytes / 5 megabytes per second = 12 seconds

So, the first 60 megabytes take 12 seconds to download.

Now, the file is 90 megabytes in size, so we need to subtract the 60 megabytes that were already downloaded from the total size. This leaves 30 megabytes left to download.

The remaining 30 megabytes download at a rate of 10 megabytes per second.

30 megabytes / 10 megabytes per second = 3 seconds

So, the total time to download the entire file is 12 seconds for the first 60 megabytes plus 3 seconds for the remaining 30 megabytes, which is 15 seconds.

Answer: 15
