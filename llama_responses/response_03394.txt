Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* City A received 16 1/2 tons of sand.
* City B received 26 tons of sand.
* City C received 24 1/2 tons of sand.
* The total for all four cities is 95 tons.

We know that City D received some amount of sand, which we will call x.

We can write an equation to represent this information:

16 1/2 + 26 + 24 1/2 + x = 95

To solve for x, we can first simplify the equation by combining the fractions:

16 1/2 = 8 and 24 1/2 = 12. So the equation becomes:

8 + 12 + x = 95

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 and 12 from both sides of the equation:

x = 95 - 20 = 75

So, the answer is:
