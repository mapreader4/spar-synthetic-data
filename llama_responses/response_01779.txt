Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of dreams he's had this year. If he's had 4 dreams every day for a year, then he's had 365 * 4 = 1440 dreams this year.

Now, last year, he had half of that, so he had 1440 / 2 = 720 dreams last year.

To find the total number of dreams he's had in the two years, we add the number of dreams from this year to the number of dreams from last year: 1440 + 720 = 2160.

Answer: 2160
