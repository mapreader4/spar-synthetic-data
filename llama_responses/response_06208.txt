Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that one batch of cookies requires 4 cups of flour and 1.5 cups of sugar. So, for 8 batches, we need to multiply these amounts.

For flour, we need 8 times 4 cups, which is 8 x 4 = 32 cups.

For sugar, we need 8 times 1.5 cups, which is 8 x 1.5 = 12 cups.

So, the total amount of flour and sugar needed is 32 cups of flour and 12 cups. We can combine these two quantities together as follows: 32 + 12 = 44.

Answer: 44
