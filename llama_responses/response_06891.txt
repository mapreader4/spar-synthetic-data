Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ben caught 4 fish, his wife Judy caught 1 fish, his oldest son Billy caught 3, his younger son Jim caught 2, and his youngest child Susie caught 5. To find the total number of fish caught, I will add these numbers together:

4 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 15

So, in total, Ben and his family caught 15 fish.

However, they threw back 3 fish that were too small. To find the number of fish they kept, I will subtract the number of fish thrown back from the total number of fish caught:

15 - 3 = 12

So, they kept 12 fish.

Each fish will give them 2 filets, so to find the total number of filets, I will multiply the number of fish kept by 2:

12 x 2 = 24

Answer: 24
