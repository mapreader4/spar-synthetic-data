Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of ornamental rings Eliza has initially. Since she buys 200, she has 200 ornamental rings initially.

Then, she sells 3/4 of the total stock. 3/4 of 200 is 150, so after selling 3/4 of the stock, she has 200 - 150 = 50 ornamental rings left.

Then, she buys 300 more ornamental rings. So now she has 50 + 300 = 350 ornamental rings.

After selling 150 of the total stock, she has 350 - 150 = 200 ornamental rings.

So, the total number of ornamental rings remaining in the store is 200.
