Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of kids at the cookout in 2004, which we'll call x.

In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004, so the number of kids in 2005 is x/2.

In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005, so the number of kids in 2006 is (x/2) * (2/3).

We know that the number of kids in 2006 was 20. So, we can set up the equation:

(x/2) * (2/3) = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

(x/2) * (2/3) * 3 = 20 * 3

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

x/2 = 60

To get x by itself, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 60 * 2

x = 120

So, there were 120 kids at the cookout in 2004.
