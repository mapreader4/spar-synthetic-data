Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: We are given that there are 100 jellybeans in the jar initially.

Step 2: We are told that 2 children called in sick and stayed home, so we subtract 2 from the total number of children. So, the number of children who attended school is 24 - 2 = 22.

Step 3: Each of the 22 children who attended school eats 3 jellybeans. So, the total number of jellybeans eaten is 22 x 3 = 66.

Step 4: To find the number of jellybeans left in the jar, we subtract the number of jellybeans eaten from the initial total. So, we have 100 - 66 = 34 jellybeans left in the jar.

Answer: 34
