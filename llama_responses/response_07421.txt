Let's break it down step by step.

1. The total prize money is $2,400.
2. The first winner will get a third of the money, which is 2,400 * 1/3 = 800.
3. The remaining money is 2,400 - 800 = 1,600.
4. The next 10 winners will each get a 10th of the remaining amount, which is 1,600 / 10 = 160.

So, the next 10 winners will each receive 160 dollars.
