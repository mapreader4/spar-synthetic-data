Let's break this down step by step.

1. Kalani has twenty candles in her bedroom.
2. The number of candles in the living room is twice that of the bedroom.
3. So, the number of candles in the living room is 20 * 2 = 40.
4. Donovan brings in 20 more candles.
5. So, the total number of candles is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80.

Answer: 80
