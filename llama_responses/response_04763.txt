Let's start by identifying the cost of the books.

Dave bought 8 books about animals, 6 books about outer space, and 3 books about trains. We can add up the total number of books to find the total cost.

8 + 6 + 3 = 17

The total number of books is 17.

Since each book costs $6, we can multiply the total number of books by the cost of each book to find the total cost.

17 * 6 = 102

Dave spent $102 on the books.
