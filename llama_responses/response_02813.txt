Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Leila went to the supermarket and spent some money.
2. She then went to her mechanic to get her automobile fixed.
3. The cost of fixing her automobile was $350.
4. The cost was $50 more than the cost of what she spent at the supermarket.

To find the total amount Leila spent, we need to add the cost of the groceries and the cost of fixing her automobile.

Let's do that now.

The cost of the groceries is unknown, so let's call it x. The cost of fixing her automobile was $350.

The problem states that the cost of fixing her automobile was $50 more than the cost of the groceries. So, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 50 = 350

We can solve for x by subtracting 50 from both sides:

x = 300

So, the cost of the groceries was $300.

Leila spent $300 at the supermarket and $350 to fix her automobile. The total amount she spent is:
