Let's break this down step by step:

1. If Lara was 9 years old 7 years ago, that means she was 9 - 7 = 2 years old 7 years ago.

2. To find out how old she will be 10 years from now, we need to add 7 years to her age now. So, we add 7 to 2 to get 9.

3. So, Lara will be 9 + 7 = 16 years old 10 years from now.
