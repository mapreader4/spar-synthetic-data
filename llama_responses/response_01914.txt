Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the cost of the electricity itself. Darla needs 300 watts of electricity, and she pays $4 per watt, so the cost is:

300 watts * $4 per watt = $1200

2. Next, she has to pay a $150 late fee. So, we add the fee to the total cost:

$1200 (electricity) + $150 (late fee) = $1350

Answer: 1350
