Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Matt is 5 years old now. In 7 years, Kaylee will be 3 times as old as Matt is now. So, we can set up an equation:

Matt's current age + 7 = 3 * Matt's current age

Matt's current age + 7 = 3 * 5

Matt's current age + 7 = 15

So, Matt's current age is 5 years.
