Let's break it down step by step.

1. The problem states that there's an online sale where you get $10 for every $100 that you spend.
2. The problem asks how much you paid after making a purchase of $250.

To find the answer, we need to find out how many $100's you spent.

$250 / $100 = 2.5

So, you spent 2.5 times $100.

2.5 x $100 = $250

Answer: 250
