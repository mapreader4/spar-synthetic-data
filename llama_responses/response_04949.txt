Let's break this down step by step.

First, Françoise buys pots of lily of the valley at €12 each. Then, she sells them at a 25% higher cost, which is €12 + 25% of €12 = €12 + €3 = €15.

Now, she sells 150 pots of lily of the valley. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of pots by the selling price: 150 x €15 = €2250.

To find the amount she gives back to the association, we subtract the cost of the pots from the revenue: €2250 - €1800 (150 pots x €12) = €450.

Answer: 450
