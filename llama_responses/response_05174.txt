Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate how much Alex needs to grow to reach 54 inches. He is currently 48 inches tall, so he needs to grow 54 - 48 = 6 inches.

Since he grows 1/3 of an inch per month, we can calculate how many months it will take him to grow 6 inches:

6 inches / (1/3 inch/month) = 18 months

So, it will take Alex 18 months to grow 6 inches naturally. However, he has a special trick to grow faster - hanging upside down. He grows 1/12 of an inch per hour while hanging upside down. To grow 6 inches, he needs to grow 6/1/12 = 6*12 = 72 hours.

Since he needs to grow 72 hours, and there are 12 months in a year, we can divide the total hours by 12 to find out how many hours he needs to hang upside down per month:

72 hours / 12 months = 6 hours per month

So, Alex needs to hang upside down for 6 hours each month to grow the extra inches needed to reach the height of 54 inches.
