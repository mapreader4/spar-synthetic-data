Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cows We the People has: 17.

We are told that Happy Good Healthy Family has two more than three times the number of cows We the People has. This means that Happy Good Healthy Family has 3 x 17/3 = 51 cows.

So, the number of cows Happy Good Healthy Family has is 51.

Now, if We the People's 17 cows are taken to the ranch to graze together with Happy Good Healthy Family's 51 cows, we need to find the total number of cows in the ranch.

17 + 51 = 68.

Answer: 68
