Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the current age of Adam, which is 8 years. Let's find the current age of Tom, which is 12 years.

To find their combined age, we need to add their individual ages. So, we will add 8 + 12, which is equal to 20.

So, in how many years will their combined age be 44 years old?

Answer: 20
