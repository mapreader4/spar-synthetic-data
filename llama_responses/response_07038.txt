Let's break it down step by step.

There are 7 puppies initially, and 6 kittens. So, in total, there are 7 + 6 = 13 pets initially.

After 2 puppies and 3 kittens are sold, we need to subtract 2 + 3 = 5 from the total number of pets.

So, the number of pets remaining at the store is 13 - 5 = 8.

Answer: 8
