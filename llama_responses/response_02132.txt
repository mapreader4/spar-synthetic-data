Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how much money the team made from selling cupcakes and cookies. They sold 50 cupcakes for $2 each, so they made 50 * 2 = $100. They sold 40 cookies for $0.5 each, so they made 40 * 0.5 = $20. The total money made from the sales is $100 + $20 = $120.

The team used $40 to buy two basketballs, so they have $80 left. Then they used the rest of the money to buy 20 bottles of energy drinks. To find out how much a bottle of energy drink costs, we can subtract the cost of the basketballs from the total money left. $120 - $80 = $40.

So, a bottle of energy drink costs $40.
