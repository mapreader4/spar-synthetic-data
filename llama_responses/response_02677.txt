Let's start by using the given information to find the total cost of the adult tickets.

There are 10 adults, so the total cost of the adult tickets is 10 x 8 = 80 dollars. The total bill is 124 dollars, so the total cost of the children's tickets is 124 - 80 = 44 dollars.

So, the cost of one child's ticket is 44 / 11 = 4.
