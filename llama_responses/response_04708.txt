Let's start by subtracting the amount spent from the initial amount.

Mirasol had $50 in her account initially.

She spent $10 on coffee beans, so we subtract that from her account balance:
$50 - $10 = $40

Then she spent $30 on a tumbler, so we subtract that from the remaining balance:
$40 - $30 = $10

So, Mirasol has $10 left in her account.

Answer: 10
