Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:

* Danielle's apartment has 6 rooms.
* Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's apartment.
* Grant's apartment has 1/9 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment.

We can start by identifying the number of rooms in Heidi's apartment. Since Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's apartment, and Danielle's apartment has 6 rooms, Heidi's apartment has 3 x 6 = 18 rooms.

Now, we can find the number of rooms in Grant's apartment. Grant's apartment has 1/9 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment. Since Heidi's apartment has 18 rooms, Grant's apartment has 18 / 9 = 2 rooms.

Answer: 2
