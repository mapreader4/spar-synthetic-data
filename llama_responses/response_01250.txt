Let's break it down step by step.

Lucia takes 2 hip-hop classes a week, so the total cost of hip-hop classes in one week is 2 x 10 = 20.

Lucia takes 2 ballet classes a week, so the total cost of ballet classes in one week is 2 x 12 = 24.

Lucia takes 1 jazz class a week, so the total cost of jazz class in one week is 1 x 8 = 8.

Adding all the costs together, we get:

20 + 24 + 8 = 52.

Answer: 52
