Let's break this down step by step.

There are 48 pieces of junk mail that need to be delivered. There are 8 houses on the block. We need to find out how many pieces of junk mail each house will get.

Let's start by finding the total number of mailboxes. We are told that 2 houses have white mailboxes and 3 houses have red mailboxes. So, the total number of mailboxes is 2 + 3 = 5.

Since there are 5 mailboxes, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail, 48, by the total number of mailboxes, 5. To do this, we can divide 48 by 5, which is 48 รท 5 = 9.6.

So, each house will get 9.6 pieces of junk mail.
