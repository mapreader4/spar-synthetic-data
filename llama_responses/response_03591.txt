Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The initial investment is $400.
2. In the first week, it gained 25% in value, which is 25% of $400, or $100.
3. So the value is now $400 + $100 = $500.
4. In the second week, it gained an additional 50% on top of the previous gain, which is 50% of $500, or $250.
5. So the total gain is $100 + $250 = $350.
6. The initial investment is $400, and the total gain is $350, so the current value is $400 + $350 = $750.

Answer: 750
