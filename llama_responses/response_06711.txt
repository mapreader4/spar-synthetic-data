Let's start by translating the sentence. "40 less than 10 times Diaz's age is 20 more than 10 times Sierra's age." Let's break it down. "40 less than 10 times Diaz's age" is asking us to subtract 40 from 10 times Diaz's age. "20 more than 10 times Sierra's age" is asking us to add 20 to 10 times Sierra's age.

Let's say Diaz's age is x. Then, 10 times Sierra's age would be 10x. Then, 40 less 10x would be 40 - 10x. 40 - 10x is equal to 30x. We know that 30x is 30. So, 10x is 3. So, Diaz's age is 3. If Sierra is currently 30 years old, then Diaz will be 3 years older than Sierra. So, 30 + 3 = 33.

Answer: 33
