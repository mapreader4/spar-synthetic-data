Let's break it down step by step.

1. Olivia's initial insurance premium is $50/month.
2. If she gets in one accident, her premium goes up 10% from $50 to $55 (=$50 + 10% of $50).
3. If she gets in one accident and gets 3 tickets, she gets charged $5 for each ticket, so she gets charged a total of $15 for the tickets.
4. So, her new insurance premium is $55 + $15 = $70.

Answer: $70
