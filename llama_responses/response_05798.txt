Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of apples that are wormy. Since a fifth of the apples have worms, and there are 85 apples, we can calculate the number of wormy apples as follows:

85 apples * 1/5 = 17

So, 17 apples have worms.

Now, let's identify the number of bruised apples. He said that nine more than one fifth of the apples are bruised, and we know that a fifth of the apples are wormy. So, the number of bruised apples is:

17 + 9 = 26

So, 26 apples are bruised.

Now, let's find the total number of apples that are either wormy or bruised. This is the sum of the number of wormy apples and the number of bruised apples:

17 + 26 = 43

So, 43 apples are either wormy or bruised.

Finally, we know that Lex has 85 apples total. So, the number of apples that are not wormy or bruised is:

85 - 43 = 42

So, Lex has 42 apples left to eat raw.
