Let's break it down step by step.

Amanda received $50 as a gift.

She plans to buy two cassette tapes that cost $9 each. So, the total cost of the cassette tapes will be 2 x 9 = $18.

She also plans to buy a headphone set that costs $25.

So, the total cost of the gift will be $18 + $25 = $43.

Amanda has $50. If she spends $43 on the gift, she will have $50 - $43 = $7 left.
