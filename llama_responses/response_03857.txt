Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The quarterback steps back to throw 80 times.
* 30% of the time, he does not get a pass thrown.
* Half of the times that he does not throw the ball, he is sacked for a loss.

Let's define the variables:

* Let's say the number of times the quarterback is sacked for a loss be x.

We know that 30% of the 80 times he throws the ball is when he does not get a pass. So, 0.3 * 80 = 24 times he does not get a pass.

Now, half of the times that he does not throw the ball, he is sacked for a loss. So, x = 0.5 * 24 = 12.

Answer: 12
