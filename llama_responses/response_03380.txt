Let's break this down step by step.

The original price of the bag was $500.

After a week, the price was reduced by 5%. This means that the new price was 95% of the original price, which is 0.95 x 500 = $475.

After a month, the price was reduced by 4%. This means that the new price was 96% of the reduced price, which is 0.96 x 475 = $454.8.

The total reduction from the original selling price is the difference between the original price and the new price, which is 500 - 454.8 = $45.2.

Answer: 45.2
