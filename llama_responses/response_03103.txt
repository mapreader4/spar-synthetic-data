Let's break down the information given: 

1. Taegan won tickets from each of the 5 carnival games. 
2. She found 5 tickets on the floor. 
3. Each ticket is worth $3. 
4. The total value of the tickets is $30.

Let's first find the value of the tickets won from each game. 

Let's say the number of tickets she won from each game be x. 

Then, we can set up the equation: 

5x + 5 = 30

We can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get: 

5x = 25

Then, we can divide both sides by 5 to get: 

x = 5

So, Taegan won 5 tickets from each game.
