Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of candy bars she sells each day. The number of candy bars she sells each day is 10 + 4 = 14. Since she sells 14 candy bars each day and each candy bar costs 10 cents, the amount she earns each day is 14 x 0.10 = 1.40. She sells candy for 6 days a week, so the amount she earns in a week is 1.40 x 6 = 8.40.

Answer: 8.40
