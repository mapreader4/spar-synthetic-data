Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the normal cost of a doctor's visit.

A normal doctor charges 200 dollars for a visit.

Tom goes to a discount clinic that is 70% cheaper, so we need to find 30% of the normal cost. 30% of 200 is 0.3 x 200 = 60.

So, Tom saves 200 - 60 = 140 dollars.

Answer: 140
