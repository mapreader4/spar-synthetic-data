Let's break down Voldemort's total daily caloric intake:

* Dinner: 110 calories (cake) + 310 calories (chips) + 215 calories (coke) = 635 calories
* Total daily caloric intake: 560 (breakfast) + 780 (lunch) + 635 (dinner) = 2095 calories

To find out how many calories Voldemort can still take, we subtract the total daily caloric intake from the 2500 calorie limit:

2500 (calorie limit) - 2095 (total daily caloric intake) = 405 calories

Answer: 405
