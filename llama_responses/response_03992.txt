Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the other two harbors have 80 pounds of lobster each. That means they have a total of 80 + 80 = 160 pounds of lobster.

Hooper Bay has twice as many pounds of lobster than the two other harbors combined. So, Hooper Bay has 2 * 160 = 320 pounds of lobster.

So, the total number of pounds of lobster for all three harbors is 160 + 320 = 480 pounds.

Answer: 480
