Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that Lidia needs to buy 15 apps, each of which costs $4. The total cost of the apps will be 15 x 4 = 60. Lidia has $66. We can subtract the cost of the apps from the total money she has to find out how much money she will be left with.

So, let's subtract 60 from 66 to find the remaining amount:

66 - 60 = 6

Answer: 6
