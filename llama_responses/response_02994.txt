Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The dog rolls around in the mud, which doesn't take any time.
2. She spends 10 minutes hosing him off outside.
3. Then, she shampoos him three times, and each shampoo takes 15 minutes.

To find the total time spent cleaning the dog, we can add up the time spent in each step:

10 minutes (hosing) + 15 minutes (shampoo 1) + 15 minutes (shampoo 2) + 15 minutes (shampoo 3) = 40 minutes

Answer: 40
