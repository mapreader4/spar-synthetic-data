Let's break it down step by step.

Denny has 100000 followers initially. Every day, he gets 1000 new followers, so the number of followers increases by 1000.

To find the number of followers he will have in a year, we need to multiply the number of followers he gets each day by the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year, so we can multiply 1000 by 365.

1000 * 365 = 365000

But, wait, 20000 people unfollowed him. So, we need to subtract 20000 from the total number of followers.

100000 + 365000 - 20000 = 765000

Answer: 765000
