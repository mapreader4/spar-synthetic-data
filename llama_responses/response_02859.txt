Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total cost of the 5 boxes of pizza. Each box costs $7, so the total cost is 5 x 7 = 35.

Since the tip is 1/7 of the total cost, it is 35 / 7 = 5.

The delivery man received $100. Now, let's calculate the change. We know the total cost of the pizzas is 35, and the delivery man received 100. So, the change is 100 - 35 = 65.

Answer: 65
