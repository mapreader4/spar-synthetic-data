Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Gary needs to pay each month if he wants to pay the loan back in 5 years. Since he needs to pay back the full amount of $6,000 in 5 years, we can find the monthly payment by dividing the total amount by the number of months in 5 years.

There are 60 months in 5 years. So, we divide 6,000 by 60 to get the monthly payment:

$6,000 รท 60 = $100

So, Gary would pay his dad $100 per month if he wanted to pay the loan back in 5 years.

Now, since Gary wants to pay the loan back in 2 years, we need to find the number of months in 2 years. There are 24 months in 2 years. Now, we need to find the monthly payment if Gary pays back the loan in 2 years.

To do this, we divide the total amount by the number of months in 2 years:

$6,000 รท 24 = $250

So, Gary would pay his dad $250 per month if he wanted to pay the loan back in 2 years.

Now, to find the difference between the monthly payments, we subtract the 2-year payment from the 5-year payment:

$100 (5-year payment) - $250 (2-year payment) = $50

So, Gary is spending $50 more each month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5 years.
