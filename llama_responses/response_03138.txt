To find the average grade Milo gets, we need to add up the grades and divide by the number of grades. There are a total of 8 grades. The sum of the grades is 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 16. Then, we divide this sum by 8 to get the average, which is 16 / 8 = 2.

Milo will get 5 times the average grade, which is 5 x 2 = 10.
