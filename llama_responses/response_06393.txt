Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of items that need to be washed: 18 shirts, 12 pants, 17 sweaters, and 13 jeans. We can add these numbers together to get the total number of items: 18 + 12 + 17 + 13 = 60.

Since the washing machine can only wash a maximum of 15 items per cycle, we can divide the total number of items by 15 to find the number of cycles needed: 60 รท 15 = 4.

Each cycle takes 45 minutes, so to find the total time needed, we can multiply the number of cycles by the time per cycle: 4 cycles ร 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we can divide by 60: 180 minutes รท 60 = 3 hours.
