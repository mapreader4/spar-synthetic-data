Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Yola's current weight is Y. Since Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola, Wanda's weight is Y + 30.

Two years ago, Yola weighed Y - 80. We know that Wanda weighs Y + 30, so Wanda's weight 2 years ago was (Y - 80) + 30. Since Wanda's weight 2 years ago is 80 pounds less than her current weight, her current weight is (Y - 80) + 30 + 80. We know that Yola's current weight is 220, so we can set up the equation:

(Y - 80) + 30 + 80 = 220

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to get:

Y - 80 + 50 = 190

Add 80 to both sides to get:

Y = 270

So, Yola weighed 270 pounds 2 years ago.
