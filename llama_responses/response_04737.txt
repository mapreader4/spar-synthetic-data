Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of black cookies Cristian has initially.

Cristian has 50 more black cookies than white cookies, so let's assume the number of black cookies is 50 + x, where x is the number of white cookies. Since Cristian initially had 80 white cookies, then x = 80.

So, the number of black cookies is 50 + 80 = 130.

Cristian eats half of the black cookies, which is 130 / 2 = 65. This leaves him with 65 black cookies.

Cristian also eats 3/4 of the white cookies, which is 80 * 3/4 = 60. Since he initially had 80 white cookies, he is left with 80 - 60 = 20 white cookies.

Now, let's add the remaining black cookies with the remaining white cookies to find the total number of cookies in the cookie jar.

65 + 20 = 85

Answer: 85
