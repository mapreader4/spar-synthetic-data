To find the total number of cups of liquid the two boys drank, we need to add the number of cups of coffee and water they drank.

Elijah drank 8.5 pints of coffee, which is equal to 17 cups of coffee. Emilio drank 9.5 pints of water, which is equal to 19 cups of water.

To find the total number of cups of liquid they drank, we add the number of cups of coffee and water they drank:

17 cups of coffee + 19 cups of water = 36 cups of liquid.

So, the answer is: Answer: 36
