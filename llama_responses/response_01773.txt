Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of gifts Savannah has. There are 12 gifts to wrap. She uses 3 gifts for the first roll and 5 gifts for the second roll. The remaining gifts left are:

12 - 3 - 5 = 4

So, the number of gifts left to wrap is 4. The third roll is used to wrap these 4 gifts. The answer is 4.
