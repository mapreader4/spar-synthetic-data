Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jane has 10 chickens that lay 6 eggs each per week. So, in 2 weeks, she will lay 10 * 6 * 2 = 120 eggs.
2. She can sell each dozen eggs for $2, so she can sell 120 / 12 = 10 dozen eggs for $2 each.
3. So, in total, Jane can sell 10 dozen eggs for 10 * 2 = $20.
4. So, Jane will make $20.

Answer: 20
