Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours:

Distance covered in 4 hours = Speed * Time
Distance = 4 km/hr * 4 hours
Distance = 16 km

The man has already covered a distance of 16 km in 4 hours. To cover the remaining distance of 24 km, we need to know the speed at which he needs to travel for the remainder of the journey.

Let's call the remaining distance to be covered, x km. We know that the total distance is 24 km, so we can set up the equation:

16 km + x km = 24 km

To solve for x, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:

x km = 24 km - 16 km
x = 8 km

Answer: 8
