Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Layla rode her bicycle slowly to the high school.
* She rode 4 miles around the running track at her faster, race pace.
* She rode back home, slowly, on the same route.
* Her total mileage was 10 miles.

We can start by identifying the distance from Layla's house to the high school as a variable, let's call it x.

The total distance she rode can be represented by the equation: 2x + 4 + x = 10

The 2x represents the distance she rode to the high school and back, and the 4 represents the distance she rode around the track.

We can solve for x by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

2x + 4 + x = 10
2x + x = 6
3x = 6
x = 2

So, the distance from Layla's house to the high school is 2 miles.
