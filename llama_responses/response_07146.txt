Let's break it down step by step.

Martha adds 3 tablespoons of ginger, which is 3 x 3 = 9 teaspoons of ginger.

She also adds 1 teaspoon of cardamom, which is 1 teaspoon.

She adds 1 teaspoon of mustard, which is 1 teaspoon.

She adds 2 tablespoons of garlic, which is 2 x 3 = 6 teaspoons of garlic.

And she adds 4 times as much chile powder as mustard, which is 4 x 1 = 4 teaspoons of chile powder.

So, in total, she adds 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 4 = 21 teaspoons of spices.

The total number of teaspoons is 21. The total number of tablespoons is 21 / 3 = 7. The percentage of ginger is 9 / 7 = 1.286, rounded to the nearest integer is 1. So, the answer is:
