Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Chenny has 10 pieces of candies to be given out. She needs to buy 4 more candies for each of her friends. So, if she needs 4 candies for each friend, the total number of candies needed is 4 * (number of friends).

Step 2: The number of friends is not given, so we need to find that out. Let's call the number of friends x. Then, the total number of candies needed is 4x.

Step 3: Since Chenny has 10 candies, she needs to give 4 candies for each friend. So, the number of friends is 10 / 4.

Step 4: 10 / 4 = 2.5. Since you can't give a fraction of a candy, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2. So, Chenny has 2 friends.

Answer: 2
