Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's call the discounted subscription cost "x".

Since the subscription normally costs $80 and it's being offered with a 45% discount, we can set up an equation to represent this:

x = 80 * (1 - 0.45)

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.45 from 1, since the discount is 45%, which means the discount is 45% of the original price.

So, 1 - 0.45 = 0.55, so:

x = 80 * 0.55

To find the discounted price, we multiply 80 by 0.55, which gives us:

x = 44

Answer: 44
