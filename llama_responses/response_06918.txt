Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Jennifer's boyfriend left 5 texts about the grocery shopping, 5 times more texts asking why she wasn't responding, and a number of texts equal to 10% of all the texts he sent previously.

Let's denote the number of texts he sent previously as x.

Then, we know that 10% of x is equal to the number of texts asking why she wasn't responding.

So, we can write the equation: 10% of x = 5.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100, since 10% is the same as 10/100, which is the same as 1/10.

So, we get: (10/100) x = 5.

Now, we can multiply both sides by 100: x = (5)(100/10).

x = 50.

So, the total number of texts he sent is 50 + 5 = 55.

Answer: 55.
