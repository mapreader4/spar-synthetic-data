To find the radius of the ash cloud, we need to find the diameter of the cloud first. The diameter of the cloud is 18 times the height it shot up into the sky, which is 18 x 300 feet = 5,400 feet.

To find the radius of the cloud, we need to divide the diameter by 2, since the diameter is twice the radius. So, the radius of the cloud is 5,400 / 2 = 2,700 feet.

Answer: 2,700
