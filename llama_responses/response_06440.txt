Let's break down the cost of a single uniform for each team member:

Individual cost:
Shirt: $7.50
Pants: $15
Socks: $4.50
Total individual cost: $7.50 + $15 + $4.50 = $27.00

Group discount cost:
Shirt: $6.75
Pants: $13.50
Socks: $3.75
Total group discount cost: $6.75 + $13.50 + $3.75 = $24.00

To find the total amount saved by the group discount, we subtract the group discount cost from the individual cost:

Total amount saved = Individual cost - Group discount cost
= $27.00 - $24.00
= $3.00

Since there are 12 team members, the total amount saved by the group discount is:

$3.00 per uniform x 12 uniforms = $36.00
