Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the distance Mr. Harris walked to the store. Since he took 2 hours, and you walk twice as fast, you can find the distance he walked in half the time, which is 1 hour. So, the distance to the store is 1 hour.

The distance to your destination is 3 times the distance to the store. So, the distance to your destination is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

Since you walk 2 times as fast as Mr. Harris, you can find your time by dividing 3 hours by 2, which is 1.5 hours.

Answer: 1.5
