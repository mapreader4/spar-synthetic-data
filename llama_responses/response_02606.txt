Let's break this down step by step:

1. The school will bring 35 students in the class, and 4 adult chaperones, so the total number of people going to the farm is 35 + 4 = 39.

2. The entrance fee for students is $5, and the entrance fee for adults is $6. So, the total cost for the entrance fee for all 39 people is 39 * ($5 + $6) = 39 * 11 = 43.

So, the school will pay $43 for the farm entrance.
