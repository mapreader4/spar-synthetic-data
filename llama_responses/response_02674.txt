Let's break down the situation step by step.

On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys.

On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some. This means she lost 5 - 3 = 2 dog toys.

Her owner got her 3 more dog toys, so now Daisy has 3 + 3 = 6 dog toys.

On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner bought her 5 more dog toys. This means Daisy now has 5 new dog toys.

If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, Daisy would have the 6 dog toys she had on Tuesday, plus the 5 new dog toys her owner bought on Wednesday. Therefore, Daisy would now have:

6 (dog toys from Tuesday) + 5 (new dog toys) = 11

Answer: 11
