Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of cars in Section G. Since there are 15 rows in Section G and each row holds 10 cars, we can multiply 15 x 10 to get the total number of cars in Section G. 15 x 10 = 150.

Next, let's find the total number of cars in Section H. Since there are 20 rows in Section H and each row holds 9 cars, we can multiply 20 x 9 to get the total number of cars in Section H. 20 x 9 = 180.

Now, let's find the total number of cars Nate needs to walk past. We can add the total number of cars in Section G and Section H to get the total number of cars Nate needs to walk past. 150 + 180 = 330.

Since Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, we can divide the total number of cars by 11 to find the number of minutes he spent searching the parking lot. 330 รท 11 = 30.

Answer: 30
