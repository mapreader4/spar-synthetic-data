Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how long it took Manu to finish the race. Since Manu took 12 more seconds than Patrick, and Patrick finished in 60 seconds, Manu finished in 60 + 12 = 72 seconds.

Now, since Amy is twice as fast as Manu, Amy would finish the race in half the time it took Manu to finish. So, Amy would finish the race in 72 / 2 = 36 seconds.

Answer: 36
