Let's think step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Felix needs to sharpen his axe every 13 trees he chops down.
* It costs $5 to sharpen his axe.
* He spent $35 on axe sharpening.

Let's find the number of times Felix sharpened his axe:

$35 รท $5 = 7

So, Felix sharpened his axe 7 times.

Now, let's find the number of trees Felix chopped down:

7 (number of times axe sharpened) ร 13 (trees per sharpening) = 91

So, Felix chopped down at least 91 trees.
