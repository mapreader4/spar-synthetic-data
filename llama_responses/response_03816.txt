Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find the total hours Goldie worked in a week.

Last week, she worked for 20 hours. This week, she worked for 30 hours. So, to find the total hours she worked in two weeks, we can add the hours:

20 + 30 = 50

Now, we need to find the total amount Goldie earned in two weeks. She makes $5 an hour. So, we multiply the total hours by the hourly rate:

50 hours * 5 = 250

So, the answer is:

Answer: 250
