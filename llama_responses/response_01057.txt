Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the volume of each container is x.

We know that the total volume of tea is 20 gallons. So, we can set up an equation: 80x = 20.

Now, we know that Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. We can represent this as 3.5x.

So, we can set up another equation: 3.5x = 20.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3.5: x = 20 / 3.5.

x = 20 / 3.5 = 5.71
