Let's start by identifying the information given: "there are 4 more male attendees than female attendees".

We can let the number of female attendees be x. Then, the number of male attendees would be x + 4.

The total number of attendees is given as 120. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 4 = 120

To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 120 - 4

x = 116

So, the number of male attendees is 116.

Answer: 116
