Let's break down the time it takes Rachel to produce a speed painting video step by step:

1. Setting up her painting supplies and camera: 1 hour
2. Recording herself painting for 1 hour: 1 hour
3. Cleaning up: 1 hour
4. Editing and posting the video: 1.5 hours

The total time it takes Rachel to produce a speed painting video is the sum of these steps:

1 hour + 1 hour + 1 hour + 1.5 hours = 3.5 hours

So, it takes Rachel 3.5 hours to produce a speed painting video.
