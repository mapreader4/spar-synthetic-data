Let's break this down step by step. We can start by finding the total number of T-shirts Maddie bought. She bought 2 packs of white T-shirts, and each pack has 5 T-shirts. So, she has 2 * 5 = 10 white T-shirts. She also bought 4 packs of blue T-shirts, and each pack has 3 T-shirts. So, she has 4 * 3 = 12 blue T-shirts. The total number of T-shirts she bought is 10 + 12 = 22.

Now, we need to find the cost of all the T-shirts. Each T-shirt costs $3. So, we multiply the total number of T-shirts by the cost per T-shirt to get the total cost. 22 * 3 = 66. So, Maddie spent $66.
