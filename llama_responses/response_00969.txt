Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Lake Crystal has 20% fewer frogs than Lassie Lake. This means that the difference between the number of frogs in Lake Crystal and Lassie Lake is 20.

We know that Lassie Lake has 45 frogs. To find the number of frogs in Lake Crystal, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of frogs in Lake Crystal.

We know that the difference between the number of frogs in Lake Crystal and Lassie Lake is 20, so we can set up an equation:

x - 45 = 20

To solve for x, we can subtract 45 from both sides of the equation:

x = 45 - 20
x = 25

So, there are 25 frogs in Lake Crystal.

To find the total number of frogs in both lakes, we can add the number of frogs in Lake Crystal (25) to the number of frogs in Lassie Lake (45):

25 + 45 = 70

Answer: 70
