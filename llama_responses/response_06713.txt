Let's break down the cost of each pie.

For the blueberry pie:

* Flour: $2
* Sugar: $1
* Eggs and butter: $1.5
* Blueberries: 3 pounds * (8 oz / 1 pound) * ($2.25 / 8 oz) = $8.25

Total cost for blueberry pie: $2 + $1 + $1.5 + $8.25 = $12.75

For the cherry pie:

* Flour: $2
* Sugar: $1
* Eggs and butter: $1.5
* Cherry filling: $14 (since it's a 4-pound bag and she only needs 1 pound, the cost is $14)

Total cost for cherry pie: $2 + $1 + $1.5 + $14 = $18.5

Since $12.75 is less than $18.5, the blueberry pie is the cheapest option.
