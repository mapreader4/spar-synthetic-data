Let's start by using a variable to represent the number of books Roselyn has. Let's call it R. We know that Roselyn gives Rebecca 40 books, and Roselyn gives Mara 3 times as many books as she gives Rebecca. We can represent this as the equation R = 3R + 40. We are told that Roselyn has 60 books remaining. So we can set up the equation R + 40 + R = 60. We can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation to get R = 20. So Roselyn had 20 books before giving Rebecca 40 books.
