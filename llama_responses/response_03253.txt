Let's start by identifying the number of big cats. The number of lions is 12. The number of tigers is 14. The total number of lions and tigers combined is 12 + 14 = 26. If there are half as many cougars as lions and tigers combined, then the number of cougars is 26 / 2 = 13. The total number of big cats is 12 + 14 + 13 = 39. 

Answer: 39
