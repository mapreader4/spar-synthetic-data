Let's start by using the information given in the problem. A third of the contestants are female, so the number of female contestants is 1/3 of the total number of contestants.

The total number of contestants is 18, so the number of female contestants is 1/3 of 18.

To find the number of male contestants, we can multiply the total number of contestants by 1/3:

18 * 1/3 = 6

Answer: 6
