Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the total number of photographs we want to take is 300. We already took 100 photographs 18 hours ago. We will take 20% fewer photographs today.

To find the number of photographs we will take today, we can subtract the number of photographs we took yesterday from the total number of photographs we want to take.

100 - 20% of 100 = 100 - 0.20 * 100 = 80

So, the number of photographs we will take today is 80.

So, the number of photographs we will take today is 80.
