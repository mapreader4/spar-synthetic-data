Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The minimum weight of a robot is 5 pounds.
* The maximum weight of a robot is twice the minimum weight, which is 5 x 2 = 10 pounds.
* The maximum weight is no less than the standard robot, which is 100 pounds.

Let's combine the two conditions:

* The maximum weight is no less than 100 pounds.
* The maximum weight of a robot is 10 pounds.

Now, let's combine these conditions. We can say that the maximum weight of a robot in the competition is 100 pounds.
