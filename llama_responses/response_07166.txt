Let's break it down step by step:

Let's first find the number of degrees Jolly has.

Let's use the information that Summer has 5 more degrees than Jolly. Since Summer has 150 degrees, we can subtract 5 from 150 to find Jolly's degrees:

150 - 5 = 145

So Jolly has 145 degrees.

Now, we can add the degrees of Summer and Jolly:

Summer has 150 degrees and Jolly has 145 degrees. To find their combined degrees, we add 150 + 145:

150 + 145 = 295

Answer: 295
