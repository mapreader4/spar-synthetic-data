Let's break it down step by step.

Mauread runs for 40 miles.
She walks for 3/5 times the distance she ran. 3/5 of 40 miles is 24 miles. So she walks 24 miles.
She walks for five times the number of miles she jogged. Let's find the distance she jogged. She jogged for 40 - 24 = 16 miles. So she walks for 5 times 16 miles, which is 80 miles.

So, the total distance Mairead has covered is 40 + 24 + 80 = 144 miles.
