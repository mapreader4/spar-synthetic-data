Let's break this down step by step.

Diana gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads. This means that for every 1 hour, she gets 30 minutes.

Her dad decided to raise her reward by 20%. This means that her reward will be increased by 20% of her original reward.

Diana read for 12 hours this week. This is a total of 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

Her original reward is 30 minutes for every hour, which is 30 * 12 = 360 minutes. So, her original reward is 360 minutes.

Now, her reward is increased by 20%. This means that her reward is increased by 20% of 360, which is 0.2 * 360 = 72.

So, her new reward is 360 + 72 = 432 minutes.

Diana will get 432 minutes of video game time.

Answer: 432
