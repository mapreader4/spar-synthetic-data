Let's break this down step by step.

Connor sleeps 6 hours a night.  Connor's brother Luke sleeps 2 hours longer than Connor.  So, if Connor sleeps 6 hours, Luke sleeps 6 + 2 hours.  But Connor's puppy sleeps twice as long as Luke.  So, if Luke sleeps 6 + 2 hours, the puppy sleeps 6 + 2 x 2 = 12 hours.  Therefore, the puppy sleeps 12 hours.

Answer: 12
