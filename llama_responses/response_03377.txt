Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find out how much time Kyle spends on weightlifting. He runs for twice the time he spends weightlifting. If he runs for twice the time he spends weightlifting, then the time he runs is 2x the time he spends weightlifting.

Let's find out how much time he spends on weightlifting. Let's say that the time he spends on weightlifting is x. Then the time he runs is 2x.

The total time he spends on practice is 2 hours. He spends half of that time on shooting, so the time he spends on shooting is 2/2 = 1 hour. The rest of the time is the time he spends on weightlifting, which is 2 hours - 1 hour = 1 hour.

So, the time he spends on weightlifting is 1 hour.
