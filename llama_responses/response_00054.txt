Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total amount of money Leah had before her dog got ahold of her wallet.

Leah earned $28, and she spent a seventh of it on a milkshake, so she had:

$28 - (1/7) Ã— $28 = $4 left after the milkshake

She put half of the remaining money in her savings account, so she put:

$12 in her savings account

Leah had $4 left over, which is the amount remaining after the milkshake and savings account. Then, her dog got ahold of her wallet and shredded all the money inside, leaving:

$4 - $1 = $3

So, Leah lost $1.
