Let's start by letting Tom's age be x. Since Tom will be 30 in five years, we can set up the equation 5 + x = 30. This means that x = 25.

Now, two years ago, Jared was twice as old as Tom. So, 2x = x, or x = 2x. Since x = 25, we can solve for Jared's age by multiplying both sides by 2, or 2x = 2(25) = 50. Therefore, Jared is 50 years old now.
