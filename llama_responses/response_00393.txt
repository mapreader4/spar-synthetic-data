To solve this problem, I will start by letting x be the width of the sandbox. The perimeter is given as 30 feet, and the length is twice the width, so the length is 2x. The perimeter is given as 30, so 2x + 2x + 2x = 30, or 4x = 30. Since the length is 2x, x = 15. So the width of the sandbox is 15 feet.
