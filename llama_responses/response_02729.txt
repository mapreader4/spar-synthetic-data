Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Each man takes 3 hours to complete a job, so they will take 3 * 3 = 9 hours to complete 5 jobs.

2. Each man earns $10 per hour, so they will earn 9 * 10 = $90 for each job.

3. Since they will complete 5 jobs, they will earn 5 * 90 = $450 in total.

Answer: 450
