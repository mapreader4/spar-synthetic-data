Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The t-shirt is $10 more expensive than the socks.
* The socks cost $5.
* The jeans are twice the price of the t-shirt.

Let's represent the price of the socks as x.
The equation for the price of the jeans is 2x, since they are twice the price of the t-shirt.

We know that the price of the socks is $5, so we can set up an equation for the price of the jeans:

2x = 5 + 10

We can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get:

2x = 5

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 5/2
x = 2.5

So, the price of the jeans is $2.50.

Answer: 2.50
