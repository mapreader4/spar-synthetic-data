Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given. Robert will turn 30 after 2 years. So, Robert's current age is 28 (30 - 2).

Now, Patrick is half the age of Robert. So, Patrick's age is half of Robert's current age. 28 / 2 = 14.

So, Patrick is currently 14 years old.
