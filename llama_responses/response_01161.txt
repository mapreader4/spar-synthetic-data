Let's break it down step by step.

Meena starts with 5 dozen cookies, which is equal to 60 cookies.

She sells 2 dozen cookies to Mr. Stone, which is 24 cookies.

She gives 7 cookies to Brock, and since Brock bought 7 cookies, she has 60 - 7 = 53 cookies left.

Katy buys twice as many cookies as Brock, which is 7 * 2 = 14. So, Meena gives 14 cookies to Katy, and she has 53 - 14 = 39 cookies left.

So, Meena has 39 cookies left.

Answer: 39
