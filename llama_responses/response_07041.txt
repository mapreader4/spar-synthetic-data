Let's first find the number of letters in Elida, which is 5. Since Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has, that means Adrianna has 5 * 2 = 10 letters. To find the average number of letters in both names, we can add the number of letters in Elida and Adrianna and divide by 2. 5 + 10 and 5 + 10 is 15, so the average is 15 / 2 = 7.5.
