Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Elisa paints 30 square feet of her house's walls.
On Tuesday, she paints twice that amount, which is 30 * 2 = 60 square feet.
On Wednesday, she finishes up by painting half as many square feet as she painted on Monday. Half of 30 is 15, so she paints 15 square feet on Wednesday.

To find the total amount of square feet Elisa paints, we add up the square feet she painted on each day: 30 + 60 + 15 = 105.

Answer: 105
