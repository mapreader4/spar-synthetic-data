Let's break it down step by step.

Roe saved $10 per month from January to July, so she saved a total of 7 months x $10 = $70.

Roe saved $15 per month from August to November, so she saved a total of 4 months x $15 = $60.

To find the total amount she needs to save in December, we can add the total she saved from January to July and the total she saved from August to November.

$70 + $60 = $130

Answer: 130
