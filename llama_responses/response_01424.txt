Let's break this down step by step!

Initially, Christian had $5.00 and Sue had $7.00, so together they had $5.00 + $7.00 = $12.00.

Christian mowed 4 yards for $5.00 each, so he earned 4 x $5.00 = $20.00.

Sue walked 6 dogs for $2.00 each, so she earned 6 x $2.00 = $12.00.

Adding Christian's earnings and Sue's earnings to their initial amount, they now have:

$12.00 + $20.00 + $12.00 = $44.00

They need $50.00 to buy the perfume, so to find out how much more they need, we subtract their current amount from the total amount needed:

$50.00 - $44.00 = $6.00
