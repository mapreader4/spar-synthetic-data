Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: We know that Jed was fined $256 for speeding. We also know that the posted speed limit is 50 mph.

Step 2: We know that the fine is $16 for each mile per hour the driver is traveling over the posted speed limit. So, we can set up an equation to represent the speed at which Jed was traveling.

Let x be the speed in mph.

The equation is: 256 = 16x.

Step 3: To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 16.

x = 256 / 16 = 16.

Answer: 16
