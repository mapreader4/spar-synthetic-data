Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the area of the original quilt. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width. So, the area of the quilt is 6 feet times 24 feet, which is 144 square feet.

Since Tony wants to turn the quilt into a square, we need to find the length of each side of the square. Since the area of the square is the same as the area of the original quilt, the length of each side of the square must be the square root of the area of the quilt. So, the length of each side of the square is the square root of 144, which is 12 feet.
