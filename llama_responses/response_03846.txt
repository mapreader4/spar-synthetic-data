Let's start by calculating the total number of kernels Jenny dropped on the way home.

Since she walks 5000 feet, and she drops 1 kernel for every 25 feet, we can divide 5000 by 25 to get the total number of kernels she dropped:

5000 รท 25 = 200

So, Jenny dropped 200 kernels of popcorn on the way home.

Now, the squirrel ate one-quarter of the kernels. To find the number of kernels the squirrel ate, we can multiply the total number of kernels by one-quarter:

200 x 1/4 = 50

So, the squirrel ate 50 kernels.

To find the number of kernels remaining on the ground, we subtract the number of kernels the squirrel ate from the total number of kernels Jenny dropped:

200 - 50 = 150

Answer: 150
