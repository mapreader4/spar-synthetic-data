Let's break this problem down step by step.

Mark takes 2 Tylenol tablets of 500 mg each. So, he takes a total of 2 x 500 mg = 1000 mg.

He takes the tablets every 4 hours. So, he takes them 3 times a day. 12 hours is equal to 3 times 4 hours. So, he takes them 3 times.

So, in total, he takes 3 x 1000 mg = 3000 mg.

Answer: 3000
