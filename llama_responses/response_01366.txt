Let's break down the problem step by step:

Ivy baked 20 cupcakes in the morning.

Let's assume that x is the number of cupcakes baked in the morning.

Then, Ivy baked 15 more cupcakes than in the morning. So, the total number of cupcakes baked is the sum of the morning and the additional cupcakes baked in the afternoon.

The equation is 20 + 15 = 35.

Answer: 35
