Let's start by calculating the total amount of money in notes:

* 2 x $100 = $200
* 1 x $50 = $50
* 5 x $20 = $100
* 3 x $10 = $30
* 7 x $5 = $35
* 27 x $1 = $27

Adding these amounts together, we get:

$200 + $50 + $100 + $30 + $35 + $27 = $442

This means that Jack has a total of $442 in notes. Since he is supposed to leave $300 in notes, that means he will have:

$442 - $300 = $142

in notes to hand in to the main office.
