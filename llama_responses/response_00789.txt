Let's break this down step by step:

James hurt himself exercising, and the pain subsided after 3 days. That means it took 3 days for the pain to go away.

He knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. So, the total time for the injury to heal would be 3 days + 5 x 3 days = 18 days.

After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again. So, he would wait 18 days + 3 days = 21 days.

After that, he wanted to wait 3 weeks to start lifting heavy again. So, we need to add 21 days + 3 weeks = 21 days + 21 days = 42 days.

So, James can lift heavy again in 42 days.
