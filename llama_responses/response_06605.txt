Let's break this problem down step by step.

Rita has already completed 50 hours of backstroke, 9 hours of breaststroke, and 121 hours of butterfly. To find the total hours she has completed so far, I add these numbers together:

50 + 9 + 121 = 180 hours

Rita has already completed 180 hours. She still needs to complete 1,500 - 180 = 1,320 hours to fulfill her coach's requirements.

Rita will dedicate 220 hours every month practicing freestyle and sidestroke. To find the number of months it will take her to complete the remaining hours, I divide the remaining hours by the number of hours she will dedicate each month:

1,320 hours / 220 hours/month = 6 months

Answer: 6
