Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many milliliters of water Mary should drink per day. Since 1.5 liters is equal to 1500 milliliters, Mary should drink 1500 milliliters of water per day.

Now, let's find out how many glasses of water Mary should drink. Since Mary's glasses hold 250 milliliters of water, we need to find how many times 250 milliliters of water is contained in 1500 milliliters.

To do this, we can divide 1500 by 250, which is the same as dividing 1500 by 250. The result is 6.

Answer: 6
