Let the total volume of water in the tank be denoted by V. Then, the volume of water remaining in the tank after Daxton empties the tank by 40% is 0.6V. Then, the volume of water that Daxton fills the tank with is 0.3V. Therefore, the final volume of water in the tank is 0.3V. The final volume of water in the tank is 0.6V - 0.3V = 0.3V = 0.6V = 4800 gallons. 

Answer: 4800
