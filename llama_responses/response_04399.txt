Let's break down the cost of each item:

* Celery: $5
* Cereal: 50% off $12 means 50% of $12 is 0.5 * $12 = $6. So, cereal costs $6.
* Bread: $8
* Milk: 10% off $10 means 10% of $10 is 0.1 * $10 = $1. So, milk costs $9.
* Potatoes: $1 each for 6 potatoes means 6 * $1 = $6

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

$5 + $6 + $8 + $9 + $6 = $26

Lily started with $60 and spent $26. So, to find out how much she has left, we subtract $26 from $60:

$60 - $26 = $34

Answer: 34
