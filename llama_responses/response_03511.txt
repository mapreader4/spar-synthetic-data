Let's break this problem down step by step.

Victoria's initial balance is $500.

She bought 2 packets of rice at $20 each, so that is a total of 2 x 20 = $40.

She also bought 3 packets of wheat flour at $25 each, so that is a total of 3 x 25 = $75.

She also bought 1 soda at $150.

So, in total, she spent $40 + $75 + $150 = $265.

Her remaining balance is $500 - $265 = $235.

Answer: 235
