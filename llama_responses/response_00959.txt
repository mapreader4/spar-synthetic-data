Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Janet made x snowballs. Then, her brother made 150 - x snowballs. We know that the total number of snowballs made is 200 (50 + 150 = 200). We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + 150 = 200

To solve for x, we can subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:

x = 200 - 150

x = 50

So, Janet made 50 snowballs, which is 50% of the total number of snowballs.
