Let's start by finding the number of gallons in the truck's tank. The truck's tank is half full, so it currently has 10 gallons of gas (20 / 2 = 10). The car's tank is 1/3 full, so it has 4 gallons of gas (12 / 3 = 4). 

To fill both tanks completely, Wendy needs to add the difference between the total capacity of both tanks (20 + 12 = 32) and the current amount of gas in both tanks (10 + 4 = 14). So, she needs to add 32 - 14 = 18 gallons of gas.
