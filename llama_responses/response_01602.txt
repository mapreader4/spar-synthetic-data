Let's break down the problem step by step.

Amelia started at one end of the country and drove 907 kilometers on Monday. So, she has 8200 - 907 = 6293 kilometers left to go.

On Tuesday, she drove 582 kilometers, so she has 6291 - 582 = 6709 kilometers left to go.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 6709
