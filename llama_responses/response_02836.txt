Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Luke catches 2 fish every day for 30 days.

Step 2: Each fish gives 2 fillets.

Step 3: So, if Luke catches 2 fish every day for 30 days, then he will catch 2 * 30 = 60 fish.

Step 4: Each fish gives 2 fillets.

Step 5: So, Luke will have 2 * 60 = 120 fillets.

Answer: 120
