To solve this problem, I will start by identifying the cost of one movie ticket as $30. Since the eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of eight movie tickets will be 2 x $30 = $60. The cost of five football game tickets is given as not provided in the problem, but we can assume it is not provided. Since we are trying to find the total amount of money Chandler will pay, we will ignore this part of the problem. 

The total cost of the movie tickets is $60, and the cost of the football game tickets is not provided. So, the total amount of money Chandler will pay is $60.
