Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with agate, which has 30 precious stones.

Let's say olivine has x precious stones.

Then, diamond has 11 more precious stones than olivine, so diamond has x + 11 precious stones.

We know that olivine has 5 more precious stones than agate, so olivine has 30 - 5 = 25 precious stones.

Now, we know that diamond has x + 11 precious stones, and we know that olivine has 25 precious stones. We can set up an equation to find the value of x.

x + 11 = 25

x = 25 - 11

x = 14

So, agate has 30 precious stones, olivine has 25 precious stones, and diamond has 14 precious stones.

Answer: 14
