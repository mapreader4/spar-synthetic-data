To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of fudge that the three friends ate. Tomas ate 1.5 pounds of chocolate fudge. Katya ate half a pound of peanut butter fudge. Since a half pound is half of a pound, Katya ate 0.5 pounds of peanut butter fudge. Boris ate 2 pounds of fudge. So, the total amount of fudge that the 3 friends ate is 1.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 2.
