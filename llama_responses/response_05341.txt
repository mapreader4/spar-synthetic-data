To find the difference in height between Mark and Mike, we need to convert the heights from feet and inches to just inches. Mark is 5 feet 3 inches tall. We can convert this to inches by multiplying the feet by 12 and then add the remaining inches. 5 * 12 is 60, so Mark is 60 + 3 = 63 inches tall. Mike is 6 feet and 1 inch tall. We can convert this to inches by multiplying the feet by 12 and then adding the remaining inches. 6 * 12 is 72, so Mike is 72 + 1 = 73 inches tall. The difference in height between Mark and Mike is 73 - 63 = 10. So, the answer is:
