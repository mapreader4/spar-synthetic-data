Let's break this problem down step by step.

There are 9 kindergartners in the first group, 10 kindergartners in the second group, and 11 kindergartners in the third group. To find the total number of kindergartners, we add these numbers together:

9 + 10 + 11 = 20

The three groups of kindergartners bring a total of 20 kindergartners.
