1. Russel rode the carousel three times. So, he used 3 tickets for the carousel.
2. Jen played the shooting game twice. So, she used 2 tickets for the shooting game.
3. The total number of tickets used is the sum of the tickets used for the carousel and the shooting game. So, we need to add 3 + 2 = 5.
