Let's break this problem down step by step.

John spent 3 years exploring the jungle. This is the total time spent on exploration.

He then spent half as much time writing up notes about his travels. To find half of 3 years, we need to divide 3 by 2.

3 รท 2 = 1.5

So, John spent 1.5 years writing up notes about his travels.

It took.5 years to write his book once he was done with the notes. So, he spent an additional 0.5 years writing the book.

To find the total time spent on his book and exploring, we add the time spent writing the book to the time spent exploring.

1.5 + 3 = 4.5

Answer: 4.5
