Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the prices of the products.

Smartphones are $300 each.
Personal computers are $500 more than smartphones, so personal computers are $800.
Advanced tablets are the sum of the prices of a smartphone and personal computer, so advanced tablets are $300 + 800 = $1100.

Now, let's add up the prices of all three products: $300 + $800 + $1100 = $1200.

Answer: 1200
