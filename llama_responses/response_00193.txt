Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is x.

Since the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B, we can set up an equation:

192 = 1.2x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

960 = 1.2x * 5

Then, we can divide both sides by 1.2 to get:

x = 800 / 1.2

x = 666.67

So, the sunflowers from Packet B were approximately 666.67 inches tall.
