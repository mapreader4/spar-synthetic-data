Let the total number of students be x.

Forty percent of the students are learning from home, so 0.4x = x/100 * 0.4 = x.

The remaining students are in school, so the number of students in school is x - 0.6x.

The question asks us to find the percent of students in school, which is 0.4x / x = 0.4.

We know that 0.4 = 0.4x / x = 0.4x / (1 - 0.6x), since the students in school are the remaining students after 40% are learning from home.

So, 0.4 = 0.4 / (1 - 0.6) = 0.4 / 0.4 = 1.

Answer: 25
