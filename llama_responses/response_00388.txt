To find the profit, we can calculate the profit as the difference between the total rent and the total cost. 

The total rent is $900 per month and the total cost is $1200 (3 people paying $400 each). So, the total cost is $1200. 

The profit is the difference between the total cost and the total rent. 

Profit = Total cost - Total rent
Profit = 1200 - 900
Profit = 300

Answer: 300
