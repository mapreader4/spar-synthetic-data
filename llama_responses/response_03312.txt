Let's break down the information given:

* The minor characters are paid $15,000 each episode.
* The major characters are paid three times as much as the minor characters.

Let's first find the total amount paid to the minor characters: 5 minor characters * $15,000 = $75,000.

The major characters are paid three times as much as the minor characters. So, the major characters are paid 3 * $75,000 = $225,000.

Since there are 5 main characters, the major characters are paid $45,000 each episode.

So, James pays $45,000 per episode for the main characters.
