Let's break down the information given:

* A portable battery charger can fully charge a smartphone in 26 minutes.
* A portable battery charger can fully charge a tablet in 53 minutes.
* Ana charged her tablet fully and her phone halfway.

Let's assume that it takes the same time to charge the phone as it takes to charge the tablet, which is 26 minutes. Since Ana charged her tablet fully, it means that the time taken to charge the phone is half of the time it takes to charge the tablet. 

So, the time taken to charge the phone is 26/2 = 13 minutes.
