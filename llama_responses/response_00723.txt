Let's break it down step by step.

John eats a bag of chips for dinner.

Let's say the number of chips in the bag is x.

John eats twice as many after dinner.

So, he eats 2x.

The total number of chips eaten is the initial bag plus the additional bag: x + 2x.

We can simplify this by combining the like terms: 2x.

So, John ate 3x bags of chips.
