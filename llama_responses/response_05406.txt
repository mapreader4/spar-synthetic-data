Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the cost of a child ticket is x.

The cost of an adult ticket is 6 dollars more than the cost of a child ticket, so the cost of an adult ticket is x + 6.

The cost of the 5 tickets is 77 dollars. The cost of the 3 child tickets is 3x, and the cost of the 2 adult tickets is 2(x + 6). The total cost of the 5 tickets is equal to the cost of the child tickets and the cost of the adult tickets, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 2(x + 6) = 77

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

3x + 2x + 12 = 77

Now, let's subtract 2x from both sides of the equation to get:

x + 12 = 77 - 2x

Subtracting 2x from both sides again, we get:

x = 77 - 2x - 12

Now, let's add 12 to both sides of the equation to get:

x = 77 + 12 - 2x

x = 89 - 2x

Now, let's add 2x to both sides of the equation to get:

x = 89

Now, we can subtract 89 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 0

So, the cost of an adult ticket is 0 dollars.
