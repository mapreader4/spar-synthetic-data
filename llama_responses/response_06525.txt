Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the mom. She has 1 eye.

Then, we have the dad. He has 3 eyes.

Next, we have the 3 kids. Each kid has 4 eyes.

To find the total number of eyes, we add the eyes from each family member:

Mom's 1 eye + dad's 3 eyes + kid 1's 4 eyes + kid 2's 4 eyes + kid 3's 4 eyes =?

Let's add them up: 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Answer: 16
