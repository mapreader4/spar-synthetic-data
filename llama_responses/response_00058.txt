To solve this problem, I will first find the total amount of money the 2/3 of the students receive, and then find the total amount of money the remaining 1/3 of the students receive. Then I will add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money all 60 students get in a day.

First, I will find the total amount of money the 2/3 of the students receive. Since 2/3 of 60 students is 40 students, the 40 students receive an average of $6 per day. So, the total amount of money they receive is 40 x 6 = $240.

Next, I will find the total amount of money the 1/3 of the students receive. Since 1/3 of 60 students is 20 students, the 20 students receive an average of $4 per day. So, the total amount of money they receive is 20 x 4 = $80.

Now, I will add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money all 60 students get in a day. 240 + 80 = $320.

Answer: 320
