Let's break it down step by step.

Belle eats 4 dog biscuits, and each biscuit is $0.25, so the cost of the biscuits is 4 x $0.25 = $1.00.

Belle also eats 2 rawhide bones, and each rawhide bone is $1, so the cost of the rawhide bones is 2 x $1 = $2.

The total cost of the treats is the cost of the biscuits plus the cost of the rawhide bones, which is $1.00 + $2 = $3.

Since Belle eats this combination of treats every evening, and there are 7 days in a week, the total cost to feed Belle these treats for a week is 7 x $3 = $21.
