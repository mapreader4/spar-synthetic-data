Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the time Jennifer spends grooming each dog. Since it takes her 20 minutes to groom each dog, and she has 2 dogs, she spends 20 * 2 = 40 minutes grooming each dog.

To find the total time spent grooming all the dogs, we multiply the time spent grooming one dog by the number of dogs, so 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.

Now, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60. 1200 รท 60 = 20 hours.

So, the answer is: Answer: 20
