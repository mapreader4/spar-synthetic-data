Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jake makes $15 for 1 hour of mowing the lawn. So, he makes $15/hour for mowing the lawn.
2. Jake takes 2 hours to plant the flowers. So, the total time taken for planting the flowers is 2 hours.
3. Jake wants to make $20/hour. So, the total amount he should charge for planting the flowers is the total time taken multiplied by the rate he wants to make, which is 2 hours * $20/hour = $40.
4. So, the answer is:

Answer: 40
