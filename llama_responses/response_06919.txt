Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the number of students who like maths. We know that 2/5 of the students like maths. To find this number, we multiply 25 (the total number of students) by 2/5, which gives us 10 students who like maths.

Next, we need to find the number of students who like history. We know that 1/3 of the remaining students like science, and the remaining students like history. We can find the remaining students who like history by subtracting the students who like maths from the total number of students. We know that 25 - 10 = 15 students like history.

Now, we need to find the combined total number of students who like history and those who like maths. We can add the number of students who like history (15) to the number of students who like maths (10), which gives us 25. 

Answer: 25
