Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jeff drove at 80 miles/hour for 6 hours, so he traveled:

80 miles/hour * 6 hours = 480 miles

Then, he drove at 60 miles/hour for 4 hours, so he traveled:

60 miles/hour * 4 hours = 240 miles

Adding the distance traveled at the two speeds, we get:

480 miles + 240 miles = 720 miles

After the stop, Jeff drove at 40 miles/hour for 2 hours, so he traveled:

40 miles/hour * 2 hours = 80 miles

Adding the distance traveled after the stop, we get:

720 miles + 80 miles = 800 miles

Jeff traveled a total of 800 miles.
