Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Stefan cuts the rope into four equal parts. This means that each part is 200 / 4 = 50 meters long.

Step 2: Stefan gives his mother half of the cut pieces, which means he gives her 2 parts of 50 meters each. This is because he has 4 parts and 4 / 2 = 2 parts left.

Step 3: Stefan subdivides the remaining pieces into two more equal parts. This means that each of the 2 parts is 50 / 2 = 25 meters long.

Answer: 25
