Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total number of bags of potatoes that are not damaged.

The total number of potatoes that are not damaged is 6500 kg - 150 kg = 6350 kg.

Each bag weighs 50 kg, so the total number of bags is 6350 kg / 50 kg = 127 bags.

Each bag is sold for $72, so the total sale is 127 bags * $72 = 9144.

Answer: 9144
