Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say there are x cans of cherry soda. We know that there are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda. So, the number of orange pop cans is 2x.

The total number of cans is the sum of the number of cherry soda cans and the number of orange pop cans. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

x + 2x = 24

We can combine like terms by adding the x to both sides:

x + 2x = 24

We can add x to both sides of the equation to get:

3x = 24

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 24/3

x = 8

So, there are 8 cans of cherry soda.
