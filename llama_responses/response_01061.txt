Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of 1 cake. The cost of 1 cake is $12.

Since John buys 3 cakes, the total cost of the cakes is 3 x $12 = $36.

John splits the cost with his brother. Since they split the cost equally, John's brother will pay half of the cost. To find half of 36, we can divide 36 by 2, which is 18.

Answer: 18
