Let's break it down step by step.

1. Barbie gave Barbie 12 earrings. So, Barbie has 12 earrings.
2. Barbie gives half of them to Alissa. Half of 12 is 6.
3. So, Barbie gives 6 earrings to Alissa.
4. Alissa now has the earrings Barbie gave her, and the earrings Alissa had before that, which was 0.
5. So, Barbie gave Alissa 6 earrings. Alissa's total number of earrings is 6 + 0 = 6.
6. Alissa's earrings tripled in number after Barbie gave her earrings. So, Alissa's total number of earrings is 6 * 3 = 18.
