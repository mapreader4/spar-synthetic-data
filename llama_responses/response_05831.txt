Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: First, we need to calculate how many meals Herman will buy in total. Since he buys a breakfast combo for himself and 3 members of his team, that's 4 people in total. Since he does this every week, we multiply 4 by 5 days in a week, so we get:

4 people x 5 days = 20 meals

Step 2: Next, we need to calculate the cost of each meal. Each meal costs $4.00, so we multiply 20 meals by 4.00:

20 meals x 4.00 = 80.00

Step 3: Finally, we multiply the total cost by the number of weeks, which is 16:

80.00 x 16 = 1280.00

Answer: 1280
