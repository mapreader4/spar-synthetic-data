Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Amber worked for 12 hours, and Armand worked one-third as long as Amber. So Armand worked 12/3 = 4 hours.

Ella worked twice as long as Armand, so Ella worked 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total number of hours the 3 people worked, we add up their hours:

12 + 4 + 8 = 24

Answer: 24
