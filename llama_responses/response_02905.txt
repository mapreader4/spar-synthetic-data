Let's start by using the information given to create an equation.

Let's start with the pencil, which is 12 centimeters long. The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters, so the pen is 12 - 2 = 10 centimeters long.

The rubber is longer than the pen by 3 centimeters, so the rubber is 10 + 3 = 13 centimeters long.

Now, let's add the lengths together to find the total length.

12 (pencil) + 10 (pen) + 13 (rubber) = 35

Answer: 35
