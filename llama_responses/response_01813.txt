Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of items Carrie has. She has 200 tomatoes and 350 carrots. So, she has a total of 200 + 350 = 550 items.

Next, let's find the total value of all the items. Each tomato is worth $1, and each carrot is worth $1.50. So, the total value of all the tomatoes is 200 x $1 = $200. The total value of all the carrots is 350 x $1.50 = $525. So, the total value of all the items is $200 + $525 = $725.

Answer: 725
