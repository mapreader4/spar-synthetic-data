Let's start by identifying the number of T-shirts and sweaters Norma leaves with.

Norma leaves with 9 T-shirts. She leaves twice as many sweaters, so she leaves 9 x 2 = 18 sweaters.

When Norma returns, she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. Triple the number of T-shirts is 3 x 9 = 27.

She leaves with 9 T-shirts and leaves 18 sweaters. In total, she leaves 9 + 18 = 27 items. When she returns, she finds 3 sweaters and 27 T-shirts. To find the number of items missing, we need to subtract the number of items she leaves with from the number of items she finds.

27 - 27 = 0. 27 - 27 = 0.

So, the number of items missing is 0.
