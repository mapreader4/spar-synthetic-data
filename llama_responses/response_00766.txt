Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of clients who need vegan meals. We know that 7 clients need vegan meals, so that's 7 meals. Now, let's find the number of clients who need kosher meals. We know that 8 clients need kosher meals, so that's 8 meals. Now, let's find the number of clients who need meals that are both vegan and kosher. We know that 3 clients need meals that are both vegan and kosher, so that's 3 meals.

Now, let's subtract the number of meals that are both vegan and kosher from the number of meals that are kosher. We know that 3 clients need meals that are both vegan and kosher, and we already know that 7 clients need vegan meals, so we subtract 3 from 7, which gives us 4 meals. We also know that 8 clients need kosher meals, so we subtract 3 from 8, which gives us 5 meals. Now, we need to find the total number of meals that are neither vegan nor kosher. We know that 7 clients need vegan meals, so that's 7 meals. We know that 8 clients need kosher meals, so that's 8 meals. We know that 3 clients need meals that are both vegan and kosher, so that's 3 meals. We subtracted 4 meals from 7, and 5 meals from 8, and 3 meals from 8, which gives us 4 meals. We know that 7 clients need vegan meals, so we subtract 4 from 7, which gives us 3 meals. We know that 8 clients need kosher meals, so we subtract 3 from 8, which gives us 5 meals. Finally, we need to find the total number of meals that are neither vegan nor kosher. We know that 3 clients need meals that are both vegan and kosher, so we subtract 3 from 5, which gives us 2 meals.
