Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the amount Jade earns per month: $1600.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spends on living expenses: 75% of $1600 is $1200 (0.75 x 1600 = 1200). So, she spends $1200 on living expenses.

The amount Jade has left over after spending on living expenses is the difference between her income and her expenses: $1600 - $1200 = $400.

So, Jade saves $400 per month.
