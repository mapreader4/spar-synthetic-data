Let's break it down step by step.

It takes 50 minutes to cut a woman's hair, so cutting 3 women's hair will take 50 x 3 = 150 minutes.

It takes 15 minutes to cut a man's hair, so cutting 2 men's hair will take 15 x 2 = 30 minutes.

It takes 25 minutes to cut a kid's hair, so cutting 3 kids' hair will take 25 x 3 = 75 minutes.

So, in total, Joe spent 150 + 30 + 75 = 255 minutes cutting hair.
