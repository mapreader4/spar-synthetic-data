Let's start by identifying the amount of money spent by Doris: Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar. This means that the amount of money spent by Doris is 6 dollars.

Now, Martha spent half as much as Doris, which means that Martha spent half of 6 dollars. Half of 6 is 3 dollars.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money spent by Doris and Martha. The total amount of money spent is 6 dollars (by Doris) + 3 dollars (by Martha) = 9 dollars.

So, the amount of money left in the cookie jar is 21 - 9 = 12 dollars.
