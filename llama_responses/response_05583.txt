Let's break this problem down step by step.

The first-place team has 12 wins and 4 ties, which means they have a total of 12 + 4 = 16 points. The second-place team has 13 wins and 1 tie, which is 13 + 1 = 14 points. Elsa's team has 8 wins and 10 ties, which is 8 + 10 = 18 points.

To find the average, we need to add the points of the three teams and divide by 3.

16 + 14 + 18 = 48

48 / 3 = 16

Answer: 16
