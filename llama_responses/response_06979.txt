Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the variables:

1. The length of the red bus is 4 times the length of the orange car.
2. The length of the orange car is 3.5 times shorter than the length of the yellow bus.
3. The length of the yellow bus is the reference point.

Now, let's use these equations to find the length of the red bus:

1. The length of the orange car is 3.5 times shorter than the length of the yellow bus. So, if the length of the yellow bus is x, the length of the orange car is x / 3.5.
2. The length of the red bus is 4 times the length of the orange car. So, if the length of the orange car is x / 3.5, the length of the red bus is 4 * (x / 3.5).
3. We can set up an equation to represent this: 4 * (x / 3.5) = 48.

Now, we can solve for the length of the red bus by solving for x:

4 * (x / 3.5) = 48

We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3.5:

(4 * (x / 3.5)) * 3.5 = 48 * 3.5

Now, we can simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying 4 and 3.5:

4 * (x / 3.5) * 3.5 = 12x

So, the equation becomes:

12x = 48 * 3.5

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

12x = 48 * 3.5 / 3.5

12x = 16

So, the length of the red bus is 16 feet.

Answer: 16
