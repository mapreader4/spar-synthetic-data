Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the given information:

* The Great Wall is 7300 kilometers long.
* The towers are spaced 5 kilometers apart.
* Each tower has 2 soldiers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of towers:

Since the towers are spaced 5 kilometers apart, and the Great Wall is 7300 kilometers long, we can calculate the number of towers by dividing the length of the wall by the distance between the towers:

7300 km (length of the wall) รท 5 km (distance between towers) = 1460 towers

Step 3: Calculate the total number of soldiers:

Since each tower has 2 soldiers, we can multiply the number of towers by the number of soldiers per tower:

1460 towers ร 2 soldiers per tower = 2920 soldiers

Answer: 2920
