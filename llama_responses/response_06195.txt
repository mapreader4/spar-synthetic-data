Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with Mara. She has 40 crayons and 10 percent of them are pink. To find the number of pink crayons Mara has, we multiply 10% by 40, which gives us 4.

Now, let's look at Luna. She has 50 crayons and 20 percent of them are pink. To find the number of pink crayons Luna has, we multiply 20% by 50, which gives us 10.

To find the total number of pink crayons they have, we add 4 (Mara's pink crayons) and 10 (Luna's pink crayons). We get 14.

Answer: 14
