Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Nicky has 2 cards worth $8 each. If he trades them for 1 card worth $21, that means he is giving up 2 * $8 = $16 and getting 1 card worth $21.

So, Nicky's profit is the difference between what he gave up and what he got. So, his profit is $21 - $16 = $5.
