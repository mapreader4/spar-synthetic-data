Let's break this down step by step.

1. There were 180 apples in each crate.
2. There were 12 crates of apples.
3. The number of apples in total is 180 * 12 = 2160.
4. 160 apples were rotten and had to be thrown away.
5. The remaining apples are 2160 - 160 = 2000.
6. The apples were packed into boxes of 20 apples each.
7. To find the number of boxes, we need to divide the remaining apples by 20.
