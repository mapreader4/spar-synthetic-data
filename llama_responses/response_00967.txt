Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees. If it decreases to 3/4 of its temperature, we need to find 3/4 of 84.

To find 3/4 of 84, we can multiply 84 by 3 and divide by 4:

84 * 3 = 252
252 รท 4 = 63

So, the temperature will decrease by 63 degrees.

Answer: 63
