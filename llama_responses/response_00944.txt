Let's break this problem down step by step.

Kylie initially has 5 daisies.

Her sister gives her 9 more daisies, so now Kylie has 5 + 9 = 14 daisies.

Then, Kylie gives half of her daisies to her mother. To find half of 14, we can divide 14 by 2, which is 7.

So, Kylie gives 7 daisies to her mother.

Now, to find out how many daisies Kylie has left, we subtract the number of daisies she gave away from the total number of daisies she had:

14 (initial daisies) - 7 (daisies given to mother) = 7

Answer: 7
