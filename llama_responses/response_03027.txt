Let's break this down step by step.

Mary started with 72 mystery books.

She joined a book club that sent her 1 book each month of the year. There are 12 months in a year, so she received 12 books from the book club.

72 + 12 = 84

Then, she went to a bookstore halfway through the year and bought 5 more books. Halfway through the year is 6 months, so she bought 5 books at this point.

84 + 5 = 89

Later, she bought 2 books at yard sales.

89 + 2 = 91

Her daughter gave her another book for her birthday, so she now has 92 books.

92

Her mother gave her a series of 4 books when Mary visited her. This brings the total to 96 books.

96

However, Mary donated 12 books she didn't want to read again to a charity shop.

96 - 12 = 84

Then, she sold 3 books to a used book store.

84 - 3 = 81

Answer: 81
