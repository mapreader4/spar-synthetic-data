Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us: Lexie is 6 years older than her brother and her sister is twice her age. This means that her sister's age is half of Lexie's age.

We are given that Lexie is 8, so her sister's age is half of 8, which is 4.

Now, we need to find the age difference between her brother and her sister. Her brother is 6 years younger than Lexie, so the age difference between her brother and her sister is 8 - 6 = 2.
