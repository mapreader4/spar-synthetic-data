Let's break this down step by step.

Marnie eats 5 chips on the first day, leaving 100 - 5 = 95 chips left.

On the second day, she eats 10 chips, so now there are 95 - 10 = 85 chips left.

On the third day, she eats 10 chips again, leaving 85 - 10 = 75 chips left.

We can continue this pattern, eating 10 chips each day until we reach 0 chips left.

Let's count how many days it takes to get to 0 chips:

1. 95 - 10 = 85
2. 85 - 10 = 75
3. 75 - 10 = 65
4. 65 - 10 = 55
5. 55 - 10 = 45
6. 45 - 10 = 35
7. 35 - 10 = 25
8. 25 - 10 = 15
9. 15 - 10 = 5
10. 5 - 10 = 0

It takes 10 days for Marnie to eat the whole bag of chips.
