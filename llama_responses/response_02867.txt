Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Micah runs 2/3 as fast as Dean, so we can say that Micah's time is 2/3 of Dean's time.

2. We also know that Jake takes 1/3 more time than Dean to finish the marathon. This means that Jake's time is 4/3 of Dean's time, since 1/3 is the same as 4/4, which is 1 more than 3/4.

3. Let's say Dean takes 9 hours to complete the marathon. We can set up an equation to represent the time taken by Micah and Jake:

Micah's time = 2/3 x 9
Jake's time = 4/3 x 9

4. Now, we can solve for Micah's time:

Micah's time = 2/3 x 9
Micah's time = 6

5. Since Jake takes 1/3 more time than Dean, and Dean takes 9 hours, Jake's time is 1/3 of 9, which is 3 hours.

6. Finally, we can add up the times to find the total time taken by the three:

Micah: 6 hours
Dean: 9 hours
Jake: 3 hours

Total time = 6 + 9 + 3
Total time = 18

Answer: 18
