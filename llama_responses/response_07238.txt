Let's break this problem down step by step!

Step 1: Determine the total distance the man will hike.
Since he hikes for 8 hours a day and 5 days, the total hours he will hike is 8 hours/day x 5 days = 40 hours.
Since he hikes at a rate of 2.5 mph, the total distance he will hike is 40 hours x 2.5 mph = 100 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of supplies needed.
The man knows he needs 0.5 pounds of supplies per mile, so for 100 miles, he will need 0.5 pounds/mile x 100 miles = 50 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of supplies he can get from the resupply.
The resupply is 25% as large as his first pack, so if we call the amount of supplies in the first pack x, the resupply is 0.25x.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of supplies he needs after the resupply.
The man needs 50 pounds initially, and he will get 0.25x pounds from the resupply. So, the total amount of supplies he needs after the resupply is 50 - 0.25x pounds.

Step 5: Set up an equation to solve for x.
Let's set up an equation: 50 - 0.25x = y, where y is the amount of supplies he needs after the resupply.

Step 6: Solve for x.
To solve for x, we can add 0.25x to both sides of the equation: 50 = 0.25x + y. Then, subtract 0.25x from both sides: 50 - 0.25x = y.

Step 7: Solve for x.
50 - 0.25x = y, so x = (50 - y) / 0.25.
