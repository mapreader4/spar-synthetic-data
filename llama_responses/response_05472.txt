Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the repairs. We have 5 phone repairs, each costing $11. So, the total cost of the phone repairs is 5 x $11 = $55.

Next, we have 2 laptop repairs, each costing $15. So, the total cost of the laptop repairs is 2 x $15 = $30.

Lastly, we have 2 computer repairs, each costing $18. So, the total cost of the computer repairs is 2 x $18 = $36.

Now, we add up the total cost of all the repairs: $55 (phone) + $30 (laptop) + $36 (computer) = $121.

Answer: 121
