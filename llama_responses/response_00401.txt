Let's break down the information given into smaller parts:

* Kimberley collects 10 pounds of firewood.
* Houston collects 12 pounds of firewood.
* The total amount of firewood collected is 35 pounds.

To find the amount collected by Ela, we can subtract the amount collected by Kimberley and Houston from the total amount:

35 pounds (total) - 10 pounds (Kimberley) - 12 pounds (Houston) =?

Subtract 10 pounds from 35 pounds, we get:

35 - 10 = 25

Ela collects 25 pounds of firewood.

Answer: 25
