Let's break it down step by step.

Clara starts with 100 stickers.

She gives 10 stickers to a boy she likes.

So, she has 100 - 10 = 90 stickers left.

Then, she gives half of the stickers which she has left to her best friends.

Half of 90 is 45.

So, Clara has 45 stickers left.

Answer: 45
