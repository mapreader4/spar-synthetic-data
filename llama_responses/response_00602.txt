Let's break it down step by step:

1. The total prize money is $800.
2. The first place gets $200, second place gets $150, and third place gets $120. That's a total of $200 + $150 + $120 = $410.
3. The remaining amount is $800 - $410 = $390.
4. The prize money for the rest of the places will be split equally. There are 15 places remaining (18 - 3 = 15).
5. $390 / 15 = $26.

Answer: 26
