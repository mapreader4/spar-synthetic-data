Let's break it down step by step.

At the first stop, 7 people got on, so the total number of people on the bus is 7.

At the second stop, 3 people got off, so the new total number of people on the bus is 7 - 3 = 4.

At the third stop, 5 people got on, so the new total number of people on the bus is 4 + 5 = 9.

At the third stop, 2 people got off, so the new total number of people on the bus is 9 - 2 = 7.

Finally, 4 people got on, so the new total number of people on the bus is 7 + 4 = 11.

Answer: 11
