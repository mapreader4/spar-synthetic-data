Let's break it down step by step.

The wages of 15 workers for 6 days is $9450. We know that the wages for 15 workers for 6 days is the same as 15 x 6 x the wages of one worker for one day. So, we can set up an equation to solve for the wages for 1 worker for 1 day. We can do this by dividing 9450 by 15 to get the wages for 1 worker for 1 day.

The wages for 1 worker for 1 day is 9450 / 15 = 630. Now, we know the wages for 1 worker for 1 day. Now, we can multiply this by 19 to get the wages for 19 workers for 1 day.

The wages for 19 workers for 1 day is 630 x 19 = 11970. So, the answer is:

Answer: 11970.
