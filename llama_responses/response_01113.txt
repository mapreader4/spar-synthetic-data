Let's start by identifying the variables. Let's say VViggo's younger brother's age is x.

Viggo's age is 10 years more than his brother's age when his brother was 2, so Viggo's age is 2 + 10 = 12.

Since Viggo's brother is now 10 years old, we know that Viggo is 12 + 10 = 22.

So, the sum of their ages is 10 + 12 = 22.
