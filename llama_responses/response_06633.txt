Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 4 pairs of pants:

4 x 110.00 - 4 x 0.30 = 440.00 - 110.00 = 330.00

The cost of the 4 pairs of pants is 330.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the 2 pairs of socks:

2 x 60.00 - 2 x 0.30 = 120.00 - 60.00 = 60.00

The cost of the 2 pairs of socks is 60.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the pants and the cost of the socks:

330.00 + 60.00 = 390.00

The total cost is 390.00.

Answer: 390.00
