To find the number of machines needed to make 50 cell phones in a minute, we can use the information given: 2 machines make 10 cell phones in a minute. So, if 2 machines make 10 cell phones in a minute, then 1 machine makes 5 cell phones in a minute. So, to make 50 cell phones in a minute, we can divide 50 by 5, which is 10. So, it would take 10 machines to make 50 cell phones in a minute.
