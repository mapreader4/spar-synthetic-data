Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the base sentence for the amount of goods stolen. The base sentence is 1 year for every $5,000 of goods stolen. Since the burglar stole $40,000 worth of goods, the base sentence is:

$40,000 / $5,000 = 8

So the base sentence is 8 years.

Since this is the burglar's third offense, the sentence is increased by 25%. 25% of 8 years is:

0.25 * 8 = 2

So the increased sentence is 2 years. Then, the additional 2 years for resisting arrest is added to the sentence:

2 + 2 = 4

The total sentence is 12 years.

Answer: 12
