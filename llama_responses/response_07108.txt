Let's call the number of jumps Bobby can jump per minute when he was a child as $x$.

We know that the number of jumps he can jump per minute as a child is 30, so we can write an equation to represent this:

$30 = x$

As an adult, Bobby can jump 1 jump per second. So the number of jumps he can make in 60 seconds is:

$60$

The number of jumps he can make in 1 minute is the same as the number of jumps he can make in 60 seconds. So, we can write another equation to represent this:

$60 = 60$

To find the difference in the number of jumps Bobby can make as an adult and as a child, we can subtract the two expressions:

$60 - 30 = 30$

$30 - 30 = 0$

So, the difference in the number of jumps Bobby can make as an adult and as a child is $\boxed{0}$.
