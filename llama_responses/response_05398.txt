Let's break this problem down step by step.

John's initial weight is 220 pounds. 10% of 220 is 22 pounds. So, John loses 22 pounds. Then, he gains 2 pounds back. 

So, let's calculate John's new weight after losing 22 pounds:

220 - 22 = 198

Then, let's add the 2 pounds he gained:

198 + 2 = 200

Answer: 200
