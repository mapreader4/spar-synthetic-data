Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the cost of the coffee and the cheesecake separately.

The cost of the coffee is $6.
The cost of the cheesecake is $10.

Next, we need to find the total cost of both items before applying the discount.

The total cost of both items is $6 + $10 = $16.

The discount is 25%, so we need to find 25% of the total cost to find the discount amount.

25% of $16 is $4.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost.

$16 - $4 = $12.

The final cost of the set is $12.
