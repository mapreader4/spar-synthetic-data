Let's break it down step by step.

Joan has 2 hours, which is equal to 120 minutes. She spends 30 minutes on the piano, 25 minutes writing music on her computer, and 38 minutes reading about the history of the piano. We can add up these times to find the total time spent so far:

30 minutes + 25 minutes + 38 minutes = 93 minutes

Joan has spent a total of 93 minutes, which is 93 minutes out of the 120 minutes she has. To find the time left, we subtract the total time spent so far from the total time she has:

120 minutes - 93 minutes = 27 minutes

So, she has 27 minutes left to use the special finger exerciser.
