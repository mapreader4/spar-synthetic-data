Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of the red roses. Jezebel needs 2 dozens of red roses. Since a dozen is 12, the cost of the red roses will be 2 x 12 x 1.50 = 24 dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of the sunflowers. Jezebel needs 3 sunflowers. The cost of each sunflower is 3 dollars, so the total cost of the sunflowers will be 3 x 3 = 9 dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of the flowers, we add the cost of the red roses and the cost of the sunflowers. So, the total cost will be 24 + 9 = 33 dollars.

Answer: 33
