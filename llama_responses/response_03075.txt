Let's break it down step by step.

James sells 5 boxes of candy bars, and each box has 10 candy bars. So, he sells a total of 5 x 10 = 50 candy bars.

He sells each candy bar for $1.50, so he makes 50 x 1.50 = 75 dollars in total revenue.

He buys each bar for $1, so he pays 50 x 1 = 50 dollars in total cost.

So, his profit is the difference between his revenue and cost. Profit = Revenue - Cost = 75 - 50 = 25.

Answer: 25
