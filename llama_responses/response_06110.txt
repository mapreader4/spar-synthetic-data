Let's break this down step by step.

Ginger worked for 8 hours outside, which means she was outside for 8 hours.

She drank a full bottle of water for every hour, so that's 8 bottles of water.

She also poured an additional 5 bottles of water over the new plants she planted.

To find out how many cups of water Ginger drank, we need to find the total amount of water she drank. 8 bottles of water is equal to 8 * 1 = 8 cups. 5 bottles of water is equal to 5 cups.

To find the total amount of cups of water Ginger drank, we add the 8 cups from the bottles she drank to the 5 cups from the additional water she poured. So, we get:

8 cups + 5 cups = 13 cups

Answer: 13
