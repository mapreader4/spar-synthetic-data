Let's start by finding the average speed Timmy went on his three trial runs.

First, we add up the three speeds: 36 + 34 + 38 = 108.

Next, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average speed: 108 รท 3 = 36.

So, Timmy's average speed is 36 mph.

To find out how much faster he needs to go to make it up the ramp, we need to subtract his average speed from the required speed of 40 mph.

40 - 36 = 4

So, Timmy needs to go 4 mph faster than his average speed to make it up the ramp.

Answer: 4
