Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of camels. Since Carla saw 12 zebras and there are half as many camels, we can set up an equation: 12 = 2x, where x is the number of camels. Solving for x, we get x = 6.

Next, we know that there are 4 times as many monkeys as camels, so we can set up another equation: 4x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 1.5.

Since Carla saw 1.5 times as many monkeys as camels, and there are 2 giraffes, we can set up an equation: 1.5x = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 1.33.

To find the difference between the number of monkeys and giraffes, we subtract 2 from 1.33: 1.33 - 2 = -0.67.

Answer: -1
