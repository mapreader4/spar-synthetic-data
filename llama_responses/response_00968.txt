To solve this problem, I will break it down step by step.

Step 1: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts initially.

Step 2: She gives away half of her blue shirts. Half of 26 is 13.

Step 3: She gives away a third of her brown shirts. A third of 36 is 12.

Step 4: After giving away the shirts, Mary has 13 blue shirts and 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts.
