Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by letting x represent the number of pounds of cheese Tony buys.

Tony has 87 dollars to spend. He spends 5 dollars per pound on beef and 7 dollars per pound on cheese. So, the total cost of the beef is 5x, and the total cost of the cheese is 7x.

The total cost of the beef and cheese is the sum of these two costs: 5x + 7x. This is equal to 87, since Tony has 87 dollars.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent this: 5x + 7x = 87.

We can subtract 5x from both sides of the equation to get 7x = 87 - 5x. This means that 7x = 82.

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7 to get x = 82/7 = 11.83.

So, Tony bought 11.83 pounds of cheese.
