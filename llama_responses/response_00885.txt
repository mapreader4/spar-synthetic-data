Let's break it down step by step.

First, the cobbler charges $250 to make the mold. This is the fixed cost.

Next, the cobbler charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes. This is the labor cost.

To find the total labor cost, multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: $75 x 8 = $600.

The cobbler agrees to charge 80% of the total cost for work. To find the discount, multiply the total cost by 0.8: ($250 + $600) x 0.8 = $850.

So, the total cost is $850.
