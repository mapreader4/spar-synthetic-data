Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the first bouquet has 9 carnations, and the second bouquet has 14 carnations. We are looking for the total number of carnations in the third bouquet.

The average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12, so the total number of carnations in the first two bouquets is 9 + 14 = 23. Since the total number of carnations in the first two bouquets is 23, the number of carnations in the third bouquet is 12 - 23 = 7.

Answer: 7
