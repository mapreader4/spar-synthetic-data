Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's find the total cost of the ice cream cones: 15 cones x $5 = 15 x 5 = 75.

Next, let's find the total cost of the pudding: 5 cups x $2 = 5 x 2 = 10.

Now, let's find the difference in the cost of the ice cream and pudding: 75 - 10 = 65.

So, Jane spent $65 more on ice cream than on pudding.
