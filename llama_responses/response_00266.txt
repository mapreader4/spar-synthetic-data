Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of hours John spends at the gym in a day. He spends 1 hour lifting weights and 1/3 of that time warming up and doing cardio. 1/3 of 1 hour is 1/3 x 1 = 1/3. So, he spends 1 + 1/3 = 1 1/3 hours at the gym each day.

Since he goes to the gym 3 times a week, the total number of hours he spends at the gym in a week is 3 x 1 1/3 = 3 x 1.33 = 4 hours.
