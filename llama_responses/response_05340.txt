Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the speed of John. He runs 4 meters in the first second. So, his speed is 4 m/s. Then, he maintains the same speed for the rest of the race. To find his speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. We know the distance is 100 meters, and the time is 13 seconds - 1 second. So, we can set up the equation:

4 m/s = 100 m / 13 s - 1 s

To solve for the speed, we can subtract 1 second from 13 seconds:

4 m/s = 100 m / 12 s

4 m/s = 8.33 m/s

Now, let's find the speed of James. He can run 10 meters in 2 seconds. So, his speed is 10 m / 2 s. We can set up the equation:

10 m / 2 s = x

To solve for the speed, we can multiply both sides by 5:

5 m / 1 s = 5 m/s

Now, we can find the time it takes James to run 100 meters. We know his speed is 5 m/s, and the distance is 100 meters. We can set up the equation:

100 m = 100 s * 5 m/s

To solve for the time, we can divide both sides by 5:

100 m / 5 m/s = 20 s

Answer: 20
