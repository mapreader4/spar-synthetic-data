Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ralph has $54.00 worth of products initially. He has an item with a small issue that costs $20.00. He gets a 20% discount on this item. To find the discount, I'll calculate 20% of the original price:

20.00 x 0.20 = 4.00

So, the discount is $4.00. The new price of the item with the small issue is:

20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00

Now, Ralph has $54.00 - $20.00 (original price) + $4.00 (discount) = $38.00 left. He also has a 10% coupon on his entire purchase. To find the discount, I'll calculate 10% of the new total:

38.00 x 0.10 = 3.80

So, the discount is $3.80. The final total price is:

38.00 - 3.80 = 34.20

Answer: 34
