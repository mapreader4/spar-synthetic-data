Let's break it down step by step.

1. Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day.
2. She practices the piano for 6 days a week, which is 6 x 20 = 120 minutes.
3. She practices the violin for three times as long as the piano, which is 3 x 20 = 60 minutes.
4. To find the total minutes in a week, we add the minutes for the piano and violin, which is 120 + 60 = 180 minutes.
5. She practices 6 weeks, which is 4 x 180 = 720 minutes.
6. The answer is 720 minutes.
