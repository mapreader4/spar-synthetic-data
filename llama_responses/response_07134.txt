Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel did.
* Gabriel collected some number of erasers, let's call that number x.
* Celine collected 2x erasers, so Celine collected 2x erasers.
* The total number of erasers is 35.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Celine collected 2x erasers, and Gabriel collected x erasers. The total number of erasers is 35.

We can set up the equation:

2x + x = 35

To solve for x, we can subtract 2x from both sides:

2x + x = 35 - 2x

x = 35 - 2x

Now we can solve for x:

x = 35 - 2x
x = 35 - 2x
x = 35 - 35
x = 0

So, Celine collected 0 erasers.
