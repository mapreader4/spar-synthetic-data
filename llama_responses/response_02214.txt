Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total time Matt spent on his homework.

Matt spent 150 minutes on his homework.

Now, he spent 30% of that time on math and 40% on science.

We can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.

30% = 0.3 and 40% = 0.4

Now, let's find the total amount of time he spent on math and science.

0.3 * 150 = 45 and 0.4 * 150 = 60

Now, we know the total time spent on math and science. Let's subtract that from the total time he spent on his homework.

150 - 45 - 60 = 45

Matt spent 45 minutes on other subjects.

Answer: 45
