Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the average price of a class in the pack of 10 classes. The total cost of the pack is $75, and there are 10 classes. To find the average, we divide the total cost by the number of classes:

$75 ÷ 10 = $7.50

So, the average price of a class in the pack is $7.50.

Since Ruby can add additional classes at a price of 1/3 more than the average price of a class, we need to find 1/3 of the average price:

$7.50 × 1/3 = $2.50

The additional classes cost $2.50 more than the average price of a class. So, the price of each additional class is $7.50 + $2.50 = $9.50.

Ruby takes a total of 13 classes. The cost of the initial 10 classes is $75. The cost of the additional 3 classes is:

3 × $9.50 = $28.50

The total cost Ruby pays is the cost of the initial classes plus the cost of the additional classes:

$75 + $28.50 = $103.50
