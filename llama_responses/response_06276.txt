Let's start by using the information given to set up an equation. We know that Daliah picked up 17.5 pounds of garbage. We know that Dewei picked up 2 pounds less than Daliah. So Dewei picked up 17.5 - 2 = 15.5 pounds of garbage. Zane picked up 4 times as many pounds of garbage as Dewei, so Zane picked up 4 * 15.5 = 61 pounds of garbage.

Answer: 61
