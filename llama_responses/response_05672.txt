Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The first stack was 5 blocks tall.
2. The second stack was 2 blocks taller than the first stack, so it is 5 + 2 = 7 blocks tall.
3. The third stack was 5 blocks shorter than the second stack, so it is 7 - 5 = 2 blocks tall.
4. The last stack was 5 blocks taller than the third stack, so it is 2 + 5 = 7 blocks tall.

The total number of blocks Pablo used is the sum of the heights of all the stacks: 5 + 7 + 2 + 7 = 21.
