Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the amount of money Daria has in her piggy bank is $x.

Since she puts $10 in it each week, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money she has in her piggy bank after t weeks:

x = 10t

We know that Daria wants to save up $120 for the vacuum cleaner. So, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money she needs:

120 = x

We can subtract the amount of money she has already saved, $20, from the total amount she needs:

120 - 20 = x

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 100

Since Daria puts $10 in her piggy bank each week, we can divide the total amount she needs, $100, by the amount she puts in each week to find the number of weeks it will take her to raise enough money to cover the expense:

100 รท 10 = 10

Answer: 10
