Let's break this down step by step.

James won a money prize at a charity raffle. This means he received an unknown amount of money. Let's call this amount x.

James donated half of his winnings back to the charity. This means he gave away x / 2 dollars to the charity.

James then spent $2 on a hot dog to celebrate his win. This means he spent 2 dollars.

Now, James had x - (x / 2) - 2 dollars left over.

Since James had $55 left over, we know that x - (x / 2) - 2 = 55. This can be written as x - x / 2 = 53.

So, to solve for x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation to get x = 55 + 2 = x. This means x = 57.

Answer: 57
