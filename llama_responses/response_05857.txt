Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how much food Ella's dog eats in one day. Since Ella's dog eats 4 pounds of food for every 1 pound of food Ella eats, and Ella eats 20 pounds of food each day, we can say that her dog eats 4 * 20 = 80 pounds of food each day.

Now, to find the total food her dog eats in 10 days, we can multiply the amount of food her dog eats each day by the number of days. 80 * 10 = 800 pounds of food in 10 days.

Answer: 800
