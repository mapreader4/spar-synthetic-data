Let's break this down step by step:

Mark used to read 2 hours a day, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. 150% of 120 is 1.5, so he now reads 1.5 * 60 = 180 minutes. There are 7 days in a week, so 180 * 7 = 1260 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1260 / 60 = 21 hours. Therefore, Mark reads 21 hours a week.
