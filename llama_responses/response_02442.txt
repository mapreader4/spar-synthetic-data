Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how long Nancy hula hoops for. Since she can hula hoop for 10 minutes, that means she can hula hoop for 600 seconds (10 minutes * 60 seconds per minute).

Next, we need to find out how long Casey hula hoops. Since Casey hula hoops 3 minutes less than Nancy, that means Casey hula hoops for 540 seconds (10 * 54 seconds per minute).

Now, we need to find out how long Morgan hula hoops. Since Morgan hula hoops three times as long as Casey, that means Morgan hula hoops for 1620 seconds (3 * 540 seconds).

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 1620
