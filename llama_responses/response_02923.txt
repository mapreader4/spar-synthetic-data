Let's start by adding the number of stamps in each book to get the total number of stamps Ruel has. 

Ruel has 4 books of 10 stamps, so that is 4 * 10 = 40 stamps. 

Ruel also has 6 books of 15 stamps, so that is 6 * 15 = 90 stamps. 

In total, Ruel has 40 + 90 stamps, which is 130 stamps. 

Answer: 130
