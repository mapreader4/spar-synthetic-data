Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say there were 500 salmon initially in the river.

Since the number of salmon in the river has increased by ten times the number initially in the river, we need to multiply the initial number by 10.

500 * 10 = 5000

So, the total number of salmon in the river now is 5000.
