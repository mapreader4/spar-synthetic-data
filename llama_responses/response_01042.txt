Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many candy bars Kim's dad buys per week. Kim's dad buys 2 candy bars per week.

Kim eats 1 candy bar every 4 weeks. So, in 16 weeks, she will eat 16 candy bars. Since she eats 1 candy bar every 4 weeks, she will eat 4 candy bars per week. In 16 weeks, she will eat 4 * 4 = 16 candy bars. So, she will have 2 * 4 = 8 candy bars left over.

So, Kim has 8 candy bars left.

Answer: 8
