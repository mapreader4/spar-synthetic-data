Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many cups of coffee are in 3 lbs. of coffee. Since each lb. of coffee brews about 40 cups, we can find the total number of cups in 3 lbs. of coffee by multiplying 3 (lbs) by 40 cups/cup. 3 * 40 = 120 cups.

Now, Angie drinks 3 cups of coffee every day. So, we can find the number of days this will last by dividing the total number of cups by the number of cups Angie drinks per day. 120 cups / 3 = 40 days.

Answer: 40
