Let's start by calculating the total amount of water consumed by the linemen. There are 12 linemen, and each drinks 8 ounces, so the total amount of water consumed by the linemen is:

12 linemen x 8 ounces/lineman = 96 ounces

This leaves 126 - 96 = 30 ounces of water remaining in the cooler after the linemen's water break.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water that the skill position players will consume. There are 10 skill position players, and each drinks 6 ounces, so the total amount of water consumed by the skill position players is:

10 skill position players x 6 ounces/skill position player = 60 ounces

Since the cooler only has 30 ounces remaining, the skill position players will need to wait for the cooler to be refilled to get a drink. Since each skill position player drinks 6 ounces, we can divide the remaining amount of water by 6 to find out how many skill position players can get a drink before the cooler needs to be refilled:

30 ounces / 6 ounces/skill position player = 5 skill position players

This means that 5 skill position players can get a drink before the cooler needs to be refilled. To find out how many more skill position players must wait, we subtract the number of skill position players who can get a drink from the total number of skill position players:

10 skill position players - 5 skill position players = 5 skill position players

Therefore, 5 skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled before they can get a drink.
