Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Purple Valley has one-quarter as many skirts as Seafoam Valley.

Let's represent the number of skirts that Purple Valley has as x. Then, we know that Purple Valley has x skirts, and we know that Seafoam Valley has skirts.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

x = (1/4) * (Seafoam Valley's skirts)

We know that Seafoam Valley has skirts, and we know that Azure Valley has skirts. So, we can substitute this into the equation:

x = (1/4) * (2/3 * 60)

We can simplify the fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 3:

x = (1/4) * (2/3) * 60
x = (1/4) * 40

Now, we can simplify the fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 4:

x = (1/1) * 40
x = 40

So, Purple Valley has 40 skirts.

Answer: 40
