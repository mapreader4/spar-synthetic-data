Let's start by using the information given in the problem.

Let's say Grace's age is x.

Since Grace's age is 3/8th the age of her grandmother, we can write an equation to represent this:

x = (3/8) * grandmother's age

We know that Grace's grandmother is 3/8th the age of her mother. So we can write another equation to represent this:

grandmother's age = (3/8) * mother's age

We are given that Grace's mother is 80 years old, so we can substitute this into the equation:

grandmother's age = (3/8) * 80

We can solve for grandmother's age by multiplying 80 by 3/8:

grandmother's age = 80 * 3/8 = 30

Now we can substitute grandmother's age back into the equation to solve for x:

x = (3/8) * grandmother's age
x = (3/8) * 30
x = 30

So, the answer is:

Answer: 30
