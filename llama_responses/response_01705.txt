Let's break it down step by step:

1. If a dozen flowers is 12 flowers, then a dozen flowers is equal to 12 flowers.
2. If Maria wants to buy 3 dozens flowers, then she wants to buy 3 x 12 = 36 flowers.
3. Since she gets 2 free flowers for every dozen flowers, then she will get 2 flowers for every 12 flowers, so for 36 flowers, she will get 2 x 3 = 6 flowers for free.
4. So, the total number of flowers Maria will have is the total number of flowers she buys, which is 36, plus the number of free flowers she gets, which is 6, so the total is 36 + 6 = 42 flowers.

Answer: 42
