Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rain that accumulated in the area on the first three days:

Day 1: 10 inches
Day 2: 2 x 10 inches = 20 inches
Day 3: 50% more than Day 2, which is 20 inches + 10 inches = 30 inches

Total rain accumulated on the first three days: 10 inches + 20 inches + 30 inches = 60 inches

Since the area can hold the equivalent of 6 feet of rain, and there are 12 inches in 1 foot, the area can hold:

6 feet x 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

of rain. Since the area has already accumulated 60 inches of rain, it has 72 inches - 60 inches = 12 inches of capacity left.

Since the area can drain out the equivalent of 3 inches of rain per day, it will take:

12 inches / 3 inches/day = 4 days

for the area to drain completely. However, the area flooded on the 4th day, so it didn't get a chance to drain any of the rain.

Therefore, the minimum amount of rain that must have fallen on the 4th day is:

72 inches - 12 inches = 60 inches

Answer: 60
