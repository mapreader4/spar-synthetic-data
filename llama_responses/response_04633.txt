Let's break it down step by step.

First, Toby and his friend order a cheeseburger for $3.65 each, so that is $3.65 x 2 = $7.3. Then, Toby gets a milkshake for $2 and his friend gets a coke for $1. That is $2 + $1 = $3. Then, they split a large fries that cost $4, so that is $4 / 2 = $2. His friend also gets three cookies that cost $.5 each, so that is $.5 x 3 = $1.5. The tax is $.2, so the total cost is $7.3 + $3 + $2 + $2 + $1.5 + $.2 = $14.8. Since they agree to split the bill, they each pay half of that, so Toby pays $14.8 / 2 = $7.4. Toby had $15, so he brings home $15 - $7.4 = $7.6.
