Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find out how far John and his dog will travel together. If John runs at 6 miles per hour when being dragged by his dog, and they run for 30 minutes, they will cover a distance of:

6 miles per hour x 0.5 hours = 3 miles

Since they run for 30 minutes, or half an hour, we multiply the distance by 0.5.

Now, let's find out how far John will run when he runs by himself. If John runs at 4 miles per hour, and he runs for an additional 30 minutes, or half an hour, he will cover a distance of:

4 miles per hour x 0.5 hours = 2 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance John has traveled:

3 miles (with his dog) + 2 miles (by himself) = 5 miles

Answer: 5
