Let's break this down step by step.

There are 5 rows of red notes, with 6 notes in each row. So, there are a total of 5 x 6 = 30 red notes.

There are 2 blue notes under each of the red notes, so there are 2 x 5 = 10 blue notes in the under category.

There are 10 blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board.

In total, the number of blue notes is 10.

To find the total number of notes in the complaints and compliments bins, we add the number of red notes (30) and the number of blue notes (10):

30 + 10 = 40

Answer: 40
