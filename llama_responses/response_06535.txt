Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total amount of money Trey needs to raise, which is the cost of the bike, which is $112.

Trey plans to raise this amount in 14 days, which is the number of days he has to sell bracelets. To find the amount he needs to raise per day, we can divide the total amount by the number of days:

$112 / 14 = $8

So, Trey needs to sell at least $8 per day.
