Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Jennie's average speed when there is no traffic is x miles per hour. Since the trip takes 4 hours when there is no traffic, we can set up an equation:

x * 4 = 200

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 200 / 4
x = 50

So, Jennie's average speed when there is no traffic is 50 miles per hour.

Now, let's say her average speed when there is heavy traffic is y miles per hour. Since the trip takes 5 hours when there is heavy traffic, we can set up an equation:

y * 5 = 200

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 1:

y = 200 / 5
y = 40

So, Jennie's average speed when there is heavy traffic is 40 miles per hour.

To find the difference between her average speed when there is heavy traffic and when there is no traffic, we can subtract 50 from 50:

50 - 40 = 10
