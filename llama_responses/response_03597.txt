I think step by step, let's break this problem down.

Nora picks 80 oranges from the first tree. Then, she picks 60 oranges from the second tree. Next, she picks 120 oranges from the third tree.

So, the total number of oranges she picked is:

80 + 60 + 120 =?

I'll calculate this: 80 + 60 is 140. Then, 140 + 120 is 260.

Answer: 260
