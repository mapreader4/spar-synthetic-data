Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the house:
The area of the house is 20.5 feet by 10 feet, which is equal to:

20.5 x 10 = 205 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of the porch:
The porch is 6 feet by 4.5 feet, which is equal to:

6 x 4.5 = 27 square feet

Step 3: Add the area of the house and the porch:
The total area to be covered with shingles is the sum of the area of the house and the porch:

205 + 27 = 232 square feet

Answer: 232
