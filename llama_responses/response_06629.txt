Let's break down the information step by step.

1. The first group had 6 people.
2. The second group had 11 people.
3. The third group had 8 people, but one person asked 3 times as many questions as usual, which is 3 * 1 = 3.
4. The last group had 7 people.

We need to add up the number of questions Cameron answered for each group. The first group: 6 people, 0 questions. The second group: 11 people, 0 questions. The third group: 8 people, 3 questions. The last group: 7 people, 0 questions.

The total number of questions Cameron answered is 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 3.

Answer: 3
