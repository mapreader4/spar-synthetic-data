Let's call Jessica's current age "x". When her mother died, Jessica was half her mother's age. So, her mother's age was 2x. When her mother would be 70, 10 years later, her age would be 80. This means that 2x = 80. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2. 2x = 80 / 2 = 40. So, Jessica is 40. 

Answer: 40
