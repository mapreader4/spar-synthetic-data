Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many planks John can make in total. From each tree, John can make 25 planks. Since he chops 30 trees, he can make a total of:

30 * 25 = 750 planks

Next, a table takes 15 planks to make. So, for 30 trees, John can make:

30 * 25 - 15 = 15 * 30 = 450 planks

John sells each table for $300, so the total amount of money he makes from selling tables is:

450 planks * $300 = $135,000

John paid $3000 for labor, so his total profit is:

$135,000 - $3000 = $105,000

Answer: 105,000
