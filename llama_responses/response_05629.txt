Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first identify the total number of townspeople.

Let's say the total number of townspeople is x.

We know that 1/3 of the townspeople have received the full COVID vaccine, so we can write that as an equation: x/3.

We also know that 1/6 of the townspeople are immune because they already recovered from COVID. This means that the number of immune townspeople is 1/6x.

Now, we know that 1/6 of the townspeople are both vaccinated and already had COVID. This means that the number of townspeople who are both vaccinated and already had COVID is 1/6x.

To find the total number of immune townspeople, we can add the number of townspeople who are immune because they received the vaccine (x/3) to the number of townspeople who are immune because they already had COVID (1/6x). This gives us the total number of immune townspeople as:

x/3 + 1/6x.

To find the percentage of the town that is immune, we can divide the total number of immune townspeople by the total number of townspeople. This gives us:

(1/3 + 1/6x) / x.

To simplify this fraction, we can simplify it by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. This gives us:

1/1 = 1.

So, the percentage of the town that is immune in some way is:

1/1 = 100%.

Answer: 100.
