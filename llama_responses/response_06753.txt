Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of tickets Amanda needs to sell on the third day be x.

The total number of tickets she has sold is the sum of the number of tickets she sold on the first day (5 * 4 = 20) and the number of tickets she sold on the second day (32), which is 20 + 32 = 52.

She needs to sell x tickets on the third day to make 80 - 52 = 28 tickets.
