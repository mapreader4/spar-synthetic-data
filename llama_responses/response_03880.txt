Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the original order of hay. There are 10 bales of hay to be delivered, and each bale costs $15. So the total cost is 10 x 15 = $150.

Now, we need to find the cost of the better quality hay. The cost of the better quality hay is $18 per bale. Since the quantity remains the same, we multiply the cost per bale by the number of bales, so the total cost of the better quality hay is 10 x 18 = $180.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of the original hay from the cost of the better quality hay: 180 - 150 = $30.

Answer: 30
