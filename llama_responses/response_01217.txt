Let's break this problem step by step.

Camden bought 3/4 times as many dogs as Rico, who has 10 more dogs than Justin. 

Since Justin has 14 dogs, Rico has 10 more dogs than Justin, so Rico has 14 + 10 = 24 dogs.

Camden bought 3/4 times as many dogs as Rico, so Camen bought 24/4 = 6 dogs.

Camden's dogs have 6 legs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs that Camen's dogs have is 6 x 4 = 24.
