Let's break this down step by step.

Day 1: Cyrus writes 25 pages.
Day 2: He writes twice that amount, which is 25 * 2 = 50 pages.
Day 3: He writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day, which is 50 * 2 = 100 pages.
Day 4: He writes 10 pages.

To find the total number of pages written, we need to add the pages from each day: 25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185.

Cyrus needs to write 500 - 185 pages to reach the total of 500 pages. 500 - 185 = 315.

Answer: 315
