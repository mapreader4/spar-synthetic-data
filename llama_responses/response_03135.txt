To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the pool together.  The length is 10 feet, the width is 6 feet, and the height is 20 feet.  So the volume is 10 * 6 * 20 = 120 cubic feet.  A cubic foot of water is 25 liters, so we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to liters.  1 cubic foot is 25 liters, so we can divide 120 cubic feet by 25 liters to find the number of cubic feet it takes to fill the pool.  120 / 25 = 4.8.  Since a liter of water costs $3, the total cost is 4.8 * 3 = 14.4.  John's total cost is 14.4 dollars.
