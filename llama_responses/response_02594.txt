Let's break it down step by step.

John plays paintball 3 times a month, so he plays 3 * 4 = 12 times in a month.

Each time he plays, he buys 3 boxes of paintballs, and each box costs $25. So, he spends 3 * 25 = 75 dollars each time.

Since he plays 12 times, he spends 12 * 75 = 900 dollars in a month.

So, the answer is: Answer: 900
