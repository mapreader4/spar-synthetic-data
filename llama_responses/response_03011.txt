Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of hours Thomas trained in a month. Since he trains for 5 hours every day, and there are 30 days in a month, the total number of hours Thomas trained in a month will be:

5 hours * 30 = 150 hours

Now, Thomas will train for the next 12 days. The number of hours he will train in total will be:

150 hours (from the previous month) + 12 hours = 162 hours

Answer: 162
