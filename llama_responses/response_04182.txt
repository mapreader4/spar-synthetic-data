Let's break this problem down step by step.

Darryl starts with 30 cantaloupes and 27 honeydews.

He drops a couple of cantaloupes, so he has 30 - 2 = 28 cantaloupes left.

He has 27 honeydews and 3 of them turn out to be rotten, so he has 27 - 3 = 24 honeydews left.

At the end of the day, he has 8 cantaloupes and 9 honeydews left.

Let's calculate the number of cantaloupes he sold:

30 - 8 = 22 cantaloupes sold

And let's calculate the number of honeydews he sold:

27 - 9 = 18 honeydews sold

He sells cantaloupes for $2 each, so he makes:

22 x 2 = 44 dollars from cantaloupes

He sells honeydews for $3 each, so he makes:

18 x 3 = 54 dollars from honeydews

Total money made:

44 + 54 = 98 dollars

Answer: 98
