Let's start by identifying the number of pounds of coal each type of boxcar can hold.

The black boxcars can hold 4000 pounds of coal. Since the blue boxcars can hold half as much as the black boxcars, the blue boxcars can hold 4000 / 2 = 2000 pounds of coal.

The red boxcars can hold 3 times as much as the blue boxcars, so they can hold 2000 * 3 = 6000 pounds of coal.

Now, let's add up the number of pounds of coal each type of boxcar can hold:

4000 + 2000 + 6000 = 12000

So, the train's boxcars can hold a total of 12000 pounds of coal.

Answer: 12000
