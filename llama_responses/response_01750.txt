Let's break it down step by step.

Alberto spent $2457 on a new engine for his car. So, that's the first part of the total cost.

Samara spent $25 on oil. That's the second part of the total cost.

Samara spent $467 on tires. That's the third part of the total cost.

Samara spent $79 on detailing for her car. That's the fourth part of the total cost.

To find the total amount spent on Samara's car, we need to add all the costs together.

$25 + $467 + $79 = $541

So, the total amount spent on Samara's car is $541.

Alberto spent $2457 on a new engine for his car. So, we need to subtract that from the total cost.

$2457 - $541 = $1916

So, the answer is: Answer: 1916.
