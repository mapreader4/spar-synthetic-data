Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total amount of money she earned from selling 10 peaches for $2 each:

10 peaches x $2 = 10 x 2 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earned from selling 4 peaches for $1.25 each:

4 peaches x $1.25 = 4 x 1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the money she earned from both parts:

$20 + $5 = $25

Finally, let's subtract the 1 peach she kept for herself:

$25 - $1.25 = $23.75

So, Lilia earned $23.75 after selling 14 peaches.
