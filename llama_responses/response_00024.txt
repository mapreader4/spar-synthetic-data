Let's break it down step by step:

Mary has a credit limit of $100, and she has already spent $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. To find out how much credit she has left, we need to subtract the amount she has spent from the total credit.

Credit = $100
Spent = $15 + $23 = $38

Credit left = $100 - $38 = $62

So, Mary will need to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.
