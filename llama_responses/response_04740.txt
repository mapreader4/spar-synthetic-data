Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the 3 boys making 12 muffins each. That's a total of 3 * 12 = 36 muffins.

Then, let's add the 2 girls making 20 muffins each. That's a total of 2 * 20 = 40 muffins.

To find the total number of muffins for sale, we add the 36 muffins made by the 3 boys to the 40 muffins made by the 2 girls. That's a total of 36 + 40 = 76 muffins.

Answer: 76
