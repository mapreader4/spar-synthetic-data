Let's break it down step by step.

1. The movie theater has 6 screens, so we know that each screen will show a different movie. This means that all 6 movies will be shown.

2. The movie theater is open for 8 hours, which is 8 x 60 minutes. Since each movie lasts 2 hours, we know that the total time is 6 movies x 2 hours = 12 hours.

3. Since the movie theater shows movies back-to-back, each movie will be shown back-to-back. This means that there are 6 movies shown in total.

Answer: 6
