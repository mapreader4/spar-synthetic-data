Let's break it down step by step:

Wally gives 3/4 of his 400 tickets to his two friends Jensen and Finley. This means that the total number of tickets given is 3/4 * 400 = 300.

Since Jensen and Finley share the tickets in a ratio of 4:11, we can write an equation to represent the number of tickets given to Finley:

Let x be the number of tickets given to Finley. Then, we can set up the equation:

x + (3/4 * 400) = 300

To solve for x, we can subtract 3/4 * 400 from both sides of the equation:

x = 300 - (3/4 * 400) = 300 - 300 = x

x = 0

So, Finley gets 0 tickets.
