Let's start by identifying the number of snakes in each ball. Each ball has 8 snakes, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 snakes. Then, there are 6 additional pairs of snakes. To find the total number of snakes, we need to double the number of pairs, which is 6 * 2 = 12. Then, we add the total number of snakes, 24, to the number of snakes in pairs, 12. The total number of snakes is 24 + 12 = 36. So, the answer is:

Answer: 36
