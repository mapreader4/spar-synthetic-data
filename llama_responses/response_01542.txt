Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total amount of nylon needed for the dog collars. It takes 18 inches of nylon to make a dog collar, so to make 9 dog collars, we need:

9 * 18 inches = 162 inches

Next, let's calculate the total amount of nylon needed for the cat collars. It takes 10 inches of nylon to make a cat collar, so to make 3 cat collars, we need:

3 * 10 inches = 30 inches

Now, let's add the total amount of nylon needed for the dog collars and cat collars:

162 inches (for the dog collars) + 30 inches (for the cat collars) = 192 inches

So, Janet needs 192 inches of nylon to make 9 dog collars and 3 cat collars.

Answer: 192
