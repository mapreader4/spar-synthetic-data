Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is the sum of the length and width. Since the perimeter is given as 100 feet, we can set up the equation:

P = 2L + 2W

We know that the width of the patio is equal to the length, so we can replace W with L in the equation:

P = 2L + 2L

We are told that the patio is four times as wide as it is long, so the width is 4L. We can substitute this into the equation:

P = 2L + 2(4L)

We are trying to find the length of the patio, so we can simplify the equation to:

P = 6L

We know that the perimeter is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

100 = 6L

To solve for L, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

L = 100 / 6
L = 16.67

Answer: 16
