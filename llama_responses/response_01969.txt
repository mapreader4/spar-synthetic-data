Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Stacy started with x berries. We know that Steve took 4 berries from Stacy, so Stacy has x - 4 berries left. We know that Stacy has 32 berries, so x - 4 = 32. We can solve for x by adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

x - 4 = 32

x = 36

So Stacy started with 36 berries.
