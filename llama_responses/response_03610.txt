Let's break down the costs:

Mary will spend $20 on the platter of pasta and $2 on the loaf of bread, so her total cost is $22.

Elle and Andrea will split the cost of the 4 cans of soda, which is $6, and the chicken wings, which is $10. So, their total cost is $16. Since they will split it, their individual cost is $8.

Joe will buy a cake that costs $5.

To find out how much more Mary will spend than the rest of the firm put together, we need to add up the costs of Elle, Andrea, and Joe, and then subtract that from Mary's total cost:

Elle's cost: $8
Andrea's cost: $8
Joe's cost: $5
Total cost of Elle, Andrea, and Joe: $21

Mary's cost: $22

Now, let's subtract the total cost of Elle, Andrea, and Joe from Mary's cost:

$22 (Mary) - $21 (Elle, Andrea, and Joe) = $1
