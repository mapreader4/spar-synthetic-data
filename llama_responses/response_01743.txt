Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. We know that the number of shrimp per guest is 5.
2. We know that the total number of guests is 40.
3. We know that the cost of shrimp per pound is $17.00.
4. We know that each pound has 20 shrimp.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shrimp: 5 shrimp per guest * 40 guests = 200 shrimp.
5. Now, let's calculate the total cost of shrimp: 200 shrimp * $17.00 per pound = 3,400.00.

Answer: 3,400.00
