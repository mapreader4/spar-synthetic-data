Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost for the hospital stay. Dakota spends 3 days in the hospital, so the hospital stay costs 3 x $900 = $2700.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the specialist visits. There are two specialists, each visiting for 15 minutes. The cost per visit is $250. The total cost for the specialists is 2 x $250 = $500.

Finally, we need to add the cost for the ambulance ride. The ambulance ride costs $1800.

To find the total cost, we add up the costs:

$2700 + $500 + $1800 = $4300

Answer: 4300
