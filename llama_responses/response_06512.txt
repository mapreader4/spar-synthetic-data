Let's break this down step by step:

1. Clara sells 50 boxes of the first type, which has 12 cookies per box. So, the number of cookies from the first type is:

50 x 12 = 600 cookies

2. Clara sells 80 boxes of the second type, which has 20 cookies per box. So, the number of cookies from the second type is:

80 x 20 = 1600 cookies

3. Clara sells 70 boxes of the third type, which has 16 cookies per box. So, the number of cookies from the third type is:

70 x 16 = 1120 cookies

4. To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies from each type:

600 + 1600 + 1120 = 3320

Answer: 3320
