Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of people who watched the second game is x.

Then, 20 fewer people watched the first game than the second game, so the number of people who watched the first game is x - 20.

The number of people who watched the third game is 15 more than the second game, so the number of people who watched the third game is x + 15.

We know that the total number of people who watched the games is 200. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x - 20) + (x + 15) = 200

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

3x - 20 + 15 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to get:

3x + 15 - 20 = 200 - 20

3x + 15 - 40 = 180

Add 40 to both sides of the equation to get:

3x + 15 = 220

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to get:

3x = 205

Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get:

x = 68.33

Since the number of people who watched the games must be a whole number, we can round up or down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round 68.33 to 68.

Answer: 68
