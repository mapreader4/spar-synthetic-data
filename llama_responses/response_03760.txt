Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many cookies Jake baked. Since Jake baked twice as many cookies as Clementine, and Clementine baked 72 cookies, Jake baked 72 x 2 = 144 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cookies Tory baked. Tory baked half as many cookies as Jake and Clementine combined. So, we need to find half of 72 + 144. 72 + 144 is 216, and half of 216 is 108. So, Tory baked 108 cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies baked by all three of them. 72 + 144 + 108 is 324 cookies.

They sell their cookies for $2 each. To find the total money they make, we need to multiply the number of cookies by the price per cookie. 324 cookies * 2 is 648.

Answer: 648
