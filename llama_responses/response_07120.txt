Let's start by finding the interest that Adam's father will receive after 2 years.

The interest rate is 8% per year. We can write the formula for this as follows:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

The principal is the initial deposit of $2000. The rate is 8% which is 0.08, and the time is 2 years. We can write the equation as follows:

Interest = 2000 * 0.08 * 2

To find the interest, we multiply the principal and the rate, then multiply the result by the time:

Interest = 2000 * 0.08 * 2 = 160

The interest is $160.

The total amount that Adam's father will have after 2 years is the sum of the deposit and the interest:

Total = Deposit + Interest

We can write the equation as follows:

Total = 2000 + 160

The total is $2160.

Answer: 2160
