Let's call the number of pages in the new edition "x". The old edition has 2 times as many pages as the new edition. So, if x is the number of pages in the new edition, then the old edition has 2x pages. The problem says that the old edition has 230 pages less than twice as many pages as the new edition, so we can set up an equation. We can say that 2x = x + 230. We can solve this equation to get x, which is 115. So, the old edition had 2(115) pages.
