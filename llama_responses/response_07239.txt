To find out how much Scout made, we need to calculate the total number of hours he worked and multiply it by his base pay, then add the tips.

On Saturday, Scout worked 4 hours and earned $10.00 per hour, so he made 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

On Sunday, Scout worked 5 hours and earned $10.00 per hour, so he made 5 x $10.00 = $50.00.

To find the total amount Scout made, we add the amount he made on Saturday and Sunday: $40.00 + $50.00 = $90.00.

So, Scout made $90.00 over the weekend.
