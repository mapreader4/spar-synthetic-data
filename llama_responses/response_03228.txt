Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how much Daisy spent on breakfast. She bought a muffin for $2 and a cup of coffee for $4. So, the total amount spent on breakfast is:

$2 + $4 = $6

Next, let's find out how much Daisy spent on lunch. She had soup, a salad, and lemonade. The soup cost $3, the salad cost $5.25, and the lemonade cost $0.75. So, the total amount spent on lunch is:

$3 + $5.25 + $0.75 = $8.75

Now, let's find out how much more Daisy spent on lunch than on breakfast. To do this, we subtract the amount spent on breakfast from the amount spent on lunch:

$8.75 - $6 = $2.75

So, Daisy spent $2.75 more on lunch than on breakfast.
