Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Joseph has 6 red socks. This means he has 3 red socks in a pair (since 6 is an even number).

The problem states that he has one less pair of red socks than he has pairs of white socks. This means he has 2 pairs of white socks, since 3 (red socks) + 1 (extra white sock) = 4, and 4 is the number of white socks in a pair.

The problem also states that he has twice as many blue socks as he has red socks. Since he has 3 red socks in a pair, he has 6 blue socks in a pair (twice 3). And since he has 2 pairs of white socks, he has 4 blue socks (since 6 blue socks in a pair minus 2 pairs of white socks leaves 4 blue socks).

The problem also states that he has three more pairs of blue socks than he has pairs of black socks. Since he has 4 blue socks, he has 1 pair of black socks (since 4 blue socks minus 3 pairs of blue socks leaves 1 pair of black socks).

Now, let's count the total number of socks:

* Red socks: 6
* White socks: 8 (2 pairs of 4)
* Blue socks: 8 (2 pairs of 4)
* Black socks: 2 (1 pair of 2)

Total number of socks: 6 + 8 + 8 + 2 = 24

Answer: 24
