Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the cost of a large pizza is $2. He orders 2 large pizzas, so that is 2 x $2 = $4.

Then, each pizza has 3 toppings. So, for 2 pizzas, that is 2 x 3 = 6 toppings. The cost of the toppings is added to the cost of the pizzas, so the total cost of the pizzas is $4 + 6 = $10.

Finally, he adds a 25% tip. 25% of $10 is $2.50. So, the total cost is $10 + $2.50 = $12.50.

Answer: 12.
