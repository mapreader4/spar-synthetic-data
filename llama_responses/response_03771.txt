Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of seats in Section A. We know that Section A has 1 subsection with 60 seats and 3 subsections with 80 seats each, so the total number of seats in Section A is 1 x 60 + 3 x 80 = 260 seats.

We know that Section B has 20 more seats than 3 times as many seats as Section A has total. We can set up an equation to represent this: Section B = 260 + 3 x?

Since 3 x 260 = 780, we can solve for Section B by adding 20 to both sides of the equation: Section B = 780 + 20 =?

Answer: 800
