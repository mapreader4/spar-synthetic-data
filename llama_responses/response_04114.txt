Let the distance of the children's football field be represented as x. Since Kristin runs 12 laps around the adult football field and the children's football field is half the distance, Kristin runs 24 laps around the children's football field.

The ratio of the number of laps that Kristin runs around the children's football field to the number of laps that Sarith runs around the children's football field is 2:1. So, if Kristin runs 24 laps, Sarith runs 12 laps.

Answer: 12
