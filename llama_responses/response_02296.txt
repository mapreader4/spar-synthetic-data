To find the total area of the gardens, we need to calculate the area of each garden and then add them up.

The area of each of Mancino's gardens is 16 feet by 5 feet, so the area of each garden is:

16 x 5 = 80 square feet

Since there are 3 gardens, the total area of Mancino's gardens is:

80 x 3 = 240 square feet

The area of each of Marquita's gardens is 8 feet by 4 feet, so the area of each garden is:

8 x 4 = 32 square feet

Since there are 2 gardens, the total area of Marquita's gardens is:

32 x 2 = 64 square feet

The total area of all their gardens combined is the sum of the areas of their gardens:

240 + 64 = 304 square feet

Answer: 304
