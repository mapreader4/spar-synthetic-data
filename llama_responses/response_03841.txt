To find the total cost of the pants and shirts, we need to multiply the number of items by the price of one item and then add the two amounts together:

2 pairs of pants for $54 each is 2 x 54 = 108
4 shirts for $33 each is 4 x 33 = 132
The total cost of the pants and shirts is 108 + 132 = 240

Laura gave $250 to the cashier, so the change would be the difference between 250 and 240.
