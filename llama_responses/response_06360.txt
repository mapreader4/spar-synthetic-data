Let's break down the cost of the dinner and ice cream into parts.

The cost of the dinner for each person is $10. Since there are 3 people, the total cost of the dinner is 3 x 10 = 30.

The total cost of the dinner is $30. Since Elisa had enough money, which is $45, she has 45 - 30 = $15 left over.
