Let's break it down step by step:

1. The cake has 8 slices, each with 347 calories, so the total calories in the cake are 8 x 347 = 2776.
2. The pan of brownies has 6 brownies, each with 375 calories, so the total calories in the pan are 6 x 375 = 2250.
3. To find the difference in calories between the cake and the pan, we subtract the calories in the pan from the calories in the cake: 2250 - 2776 = 274.

Answer: 274
