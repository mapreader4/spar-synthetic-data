Let's start by letting's say that Henry had x games at first. Since Henry gave 6 games to Neil, we know that Henry has 6 more games than Neil. So, we can write this as an equation: x - 6 = 4x. We can solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, which gives us: x - 6 - 6 = 4x - 6. This simplifies to x - 6 = 4x. Then, we can add 6 to both sides to get x = 10. So, Henry had 10 games at first.
