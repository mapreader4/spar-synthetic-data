Let's think step by step.

Let's find the three consecutive odd integers. Let's call the first integer x. Since the sum of these three integers is -147, we can write the equation:

x - (x + 2) - (x + 4) = -147

To make it easier to solve, we can simplify the equation by adding the right-hand side:

x - (x + 2) - (x + 4) = -147
x - x - 2 = -147

Now, we can move the -2 to the left side of the equation:

x - x = -147 + 2
x = -145

So, the largest integer that satisfies this equation is 143.

Answer: 143
