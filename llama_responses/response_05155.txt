Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* There are 6 forks in the cutlery drawer.
* There are 9 more knives than forks, which means there are 9 + 6 = 15 knives.
* There are twice as many spoons as knives, which means there are 2 x 15 = 30 spoons.
* There are half as many teaspoons as forks, which means there are (1/2) x 6 = 3 teaspoons.

Now, let's add 2 of each cutlery to the drawer:

* 6 forks + 2 = 8 forks
* 15 knives + 2 = 17 knives
* 30 spoons + 2 = 32 spoons
* 3 teaspoons + 2 = 5 teaspoons

Now, let's add all the cutlery together:

8 + 17 + 32 + 5 = 52

Answer: 52
