Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Kayla's sister, Kimiko, is 26 years old.
* Kayla is half the age of her sister, which means that Kayla is 13 years old.

Since the minimum age to drive in Kayla's state is 18 years, we need to find the difference between 18 and 13.

To find the difference, we can subtract 13 from 18:

18 - 13 = 5

So, the answer is: Answer: 5
