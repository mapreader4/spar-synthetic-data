Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's identify the total amount of newspaper collected in the first two weeks: 280 kilos.

Step 2: The total amount of newspaper needed to reach their target is 280 + 320 = 600 kilos.

Step 3: The problem asks us to find the amount of newspaper needed after the third week. So, we need to find the difference between the target and the amount collected in the first two weeks.

Step 4: The difference between 600 and 280 is 320.

Answer: 320.
