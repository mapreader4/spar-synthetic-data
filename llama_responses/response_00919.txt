Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, Aisha has 500 songs on her mp3 player.

The week after, she adds another 500 songs, so she now has:
500 (initial songs) + 500 (new songs) = 1000 songs

Then, she adds twice the amount she already has, which is:
1000 songs x 2 = 2000 songs

So, after adding the new songs, she now has:
1000 (initial songs) + 2000 (new songs) = 3000 songs

However, she decides to remove 50 songs that she doesn't like. To find the number of songs she has left, we subtract the 50 songs from the total:
3000 songs - 50 songs = 2950 songs

Answer: 2950
