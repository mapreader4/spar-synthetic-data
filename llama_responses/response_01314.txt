To find the rate of the train, we can divide the total distance traveled, 270 miles, by the time taken, 3 hours.

270 miles / 3 hours = 90 miles per hour.

To find the time it would take to travel 180 miles, we can divide the additional distance, 180 miles, by the rate, 90 miles per hour.

180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours.
