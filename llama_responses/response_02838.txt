To solve this problem, we can convert all the given distances to feet.

Lionel walked 4 miles. 4 miles is equal to 4 * 5280 feet.

Esther walked 975 yards. 975 yards is equal to 975 * 3 feet.

Niklaus walked 1287 feet.

Now, we can add up all the distances walked:

4 * 5280 + 975 * 3 + 1287 = 10560 + 2940 = 13400

Answer: 13400
