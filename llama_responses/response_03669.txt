Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what was sold:

* 3/5 of the chocolate-flavored ice creams were sold.
* 2/3 of the mango-flavored ice creams were sold.

First, let's convert these fractions to decimals to make it easier to work with:
* 3/5 = 0.6
* 2/3 = 0.67

Now, let's find the total number of ice creams sold:
* Chocolate-flavored: 0.6 * 50 = 30
* Mango-flavored: 0.67 * 54 = 36.18 (round down to 36)

The total number of ice creams sold is 30 + 36 = 66.

To find the number of ice creams that were not sold, we subtract the number sold from the total:
50 (total) - 66 (sold) = 16

Answer: 16
