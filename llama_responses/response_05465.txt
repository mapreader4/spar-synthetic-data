Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the laptop originally costs $800. Since there is a 15% discount, we need to find 15% of the original price to find the amount of the discount.

To find 15% of 800, we can multiply 800 by 0.15. 800 * 0.15 = 120.

So, the discount is $120.

To find the new price, we subtract the discount from the original price:

800 - 120 = 680

So, the new price is $680.

Answer: 680
