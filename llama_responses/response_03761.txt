Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the dog has x fleas initially.

After the first flea treatment, the dog will have half the fleas it had initially, so the dog will have x/2 fleas.

After the second treatment, the dog will have half of x/2 fleas, which is x/4 fleas.

After the third treatment, the dog will have half of x/4 fleas, which is x/8 fleas.

After the fourth treatment, the dog will have half of x/8 fleas, which is x/16 fleas.

We are given that after four treatments, the dog has 14 fleas left. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

Let's call the initial number of fleas x. Then, we can write an equation to represent the number of fleas the dog had before the treatments.

x - (x/2) - (x/2) - (x/4) - (x/8) = 14

We can simplify this equation to get:

x - (x/2) - (x/2) - (x/4) - (x/8) = 14

Combine the like terms:

x - (x/2) - (x/2) = x - x/2

Subtract x/4 and x/8 from both sides:

x - x/2 - x/4 - x/8 = 14

Combine the like terms:

x - x/2 - x/4 = 14 + x/8

Add x/8 to both sides:

x - x/2 - x/4 + x/8 = 14 + x/8

Subtract x/2 from both sides:

x - x/2 + x/8 = 14

Now, we can solve for x:

x - x/2 + x/8 = 14

Add x/2 to both sides:

x + x/8 = 14 + x/2

Subtract x/8 from both sides:

x + x/8 = 14 + x/2 - x/8

Subtract x/2 from both sides:

x + x/8 = 14

We can solve for x:

x = 14 + x/8 - x/2

x = 14 + x/8 - x/2

x = 14 + x/8 - x/2

x = 14 + 14/8 - 14/2

x = 14 + 1.75
