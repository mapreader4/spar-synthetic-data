Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's let the number of campers three weeks ago be x.

Since there were 40 campers two weeks ago, and there were 10 more than the number of campers three weeks ago, we can set up an equation.

x - 10 = 40

To solve for x, we can add 10 to both sides of the equation.

x = 40 + 10
x = 50

So, there were 50 campers three weeks ago.

Now, we need to find the number of campers last week. We know that there were 150 campers in total, and we know that there were 50 campers three weeks ago. To find the number of campers last week, we need to subtract the 50 campers three weeks ago from the total number of campers.

150 - 50 =?

Let's subtract 50 from 150.

150 - 50 = 100

Answer: 100
