Let's break this problem down step by step.

Danielle has $10 for supplies. She spends $3 on the molds, leaving her with $10 - $3 = $7.

She also spends $1 on a pack of 100 popsicle sticks, leaving her with $7 - $1 = $6.

Now, she has $6 left to spend on juice. Each bottle of juice makes 20 popsicles and costs $2, so she can buy $6 รท $2 = 3 bottles of juice.

Each bottle of juice makes 20 popsicles, so she can make a total of 3 x 20 = 60 popsicles.

She started with 100 popsicle sticks and used them to make 60 popsicles, so she will be left with 100 - 60 = 40 popsicle sticks.

Answer: 40
