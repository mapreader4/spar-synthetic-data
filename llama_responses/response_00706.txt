To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tiles needed to be completed the pool. We know that the pool has 48 blue tiles and 32 red tiles. The total number of tiles needed is 48 + 32 = 80. Since the pool needs 100 tiles, we need to find the difference between the total number of tiles and the number of tiles needed. 

Answer: 100 - 80 = 20
