Let's break this problem down step by step.

The tank is leaking at a rate of 1.5 ounces per hour. To find the total amount of fluid that will leak over 12 hours, we can multiply the rate by the time:

1.5 ounces/hour x 12 hours =?

To multiply these numbers, we can multiply the numbers first and then the units:

1.5 x 12 = 18

So, the total amount of fluid that will leak over 12 hours is 18 ounces.

Since Kevin wants to collect twice the amount of fluid that will leak over 12 hours, we need to multiply the total amount by 2:

18 ounces x 2 =?

Again, we can multiply the numbers first and then the units:

18 x 2 = 36

So, Kevin used a bucket that can hold 36 ounces of fluid.

Answer: 36
