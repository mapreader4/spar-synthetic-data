Let's start by subtracting the cost of the jumper from the initial amount of money Natalie has.

Natalie has $26 initially.

Natalie spent $9 on a jumper, so subtract that from the initial amount.

$26 - $9 = $17

Next, she spent $4 on a T-shirt.

$17 - $4 = $13

Finally, she spent $5 on a pair of heels.

$13 - $5 = $8

So, Natalie has $8 left.
