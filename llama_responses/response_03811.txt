Let's break this problem down step by step.

Carmen sells 3 boxes of samoas for $4 each, so she earns 3 x 4 = 12 dollars. She sells 2 boxes of thin mints for $3.50 each, so she earns 2 x 3.50 = 7 dollars. She sells one box of fudge delights for $5, so she earns 1 x 5 = 5 dollars. And she sells 9 boxes of sugar cookies for $2 each, so she earns 9 x 2 = 18 dollars.

So, in total, Carmen makes 12 + 7 + 5 + 18 = 42 dollars. Answer: 42
