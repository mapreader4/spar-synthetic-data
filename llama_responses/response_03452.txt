Let's break this problem down step by step.

The problem states that Mrs. Merril wants to follow a 2-hour screen time for her child. So, the maximum amount of time her child can use his gadget is 120 minutes.

Since the child already used his gadget for 45 minutes in the morning, we need to subtract that from the total amount of time allowed.

120 minutes - 45 minutes = 75 minutes

So, Mrs. Merril will allow her child to use his gadget for 75 minutes this evening.
