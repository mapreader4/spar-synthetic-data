Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning. 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning, and 1/4 is the same as 1/2, so 1/4 = 1/2. So, 1/2 of the kids are going to soccer camp in the morning.

There are 750 kids in camp. Half of them are going to soccer camp, so 750/2 = 375 kids are going to soccer camp.

Now, we add the kids going to soccer camp in the morning to the kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon. 375 + 375 = 750 kids going to soccer camp.

Answer: 750
