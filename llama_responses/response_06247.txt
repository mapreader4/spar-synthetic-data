Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that the box can hold 40 pounds of cookies. Since each cookie weighs 2 ounces, we need to find out how many cookies 40 pounds is equivalent to.

Since 40 pounds is equivalent to 40 * 16 ounces (since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces), we know that the box can hold 40 * 16 = 640 cookies.

Answer: 640
