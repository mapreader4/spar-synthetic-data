Let's start by identifying the total distance Kennedy drove. We know that Kennedy drove 15 miles to school, 6 miles to the softball park, 2 miles to a burger restaurant, and 11 miles home. We can add these distances to find the total distance:

15 + 6 + 2 + 11 = 33

Kennedy drove a total of 33 miles. Since her car can drive 19 miles per gallon of gas, we can divide the total distance by the rate to find the amount of gas consumed:

33 miles / 19 miles per gallon = 1.73 gallons

So Kennedy started with 1.73 gallons of gas.
