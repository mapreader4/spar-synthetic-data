Let's start by adding up the rainfall amounts for each month:

March: 3.79 inches
April: 4.5 inches
May: 3.95 inches
June: 3.09 inches
July: 4.67 inches

The total rainfall is 3.79 + 4.5 + 3.95 + 3.09 + 4.67 = 16.00 inches

To find the average rainfall, we can divide the total rainfall by the number of months:

16.00 / 4 = 4
