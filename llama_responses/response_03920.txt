Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of alligators at the beginning of the year. Since the problem states that there are 4 alligators, we can assume that this is the initial number.

Next, we need to find out how many alligators will there be at the end of a year. The problem states that the number of alligators doubles every six months, so we need to multiply the initial number of alligators by 2, twice.

At the end of the first six months, there will be 4 * 2 = 8 alligators. At the end of the next six months, there will be 8 * 2 = 16 alligators. Therefore, at the end of a year, there will be 8 + 16 = 24 alligators.
