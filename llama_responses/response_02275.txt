Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be the number of apples Mary ate. We know that Mary bought 6 apples and from the apples she bought, for each that Mary ate, she planted two trees from the remaining ones. So, the number of apples Mary ate is 6 - 2x.

We can represent this as the equation 6 - 2x = 4.

Since Mary ate some apples, she must have eaten some of the apples. So, the number of apples Mary ate is 4.

Answer: 4
