Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many miles John drives in a week. He drives 20 miles to work each way 5 days a week, so he drives 20 x 2 = 40 miles to and from work each week. He also drives 40 miles a week for leisure, so the total miles driven in a week is 40 + 40 = 80 miles.
