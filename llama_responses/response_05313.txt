Let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that the total number of cake pieces is 240.

Next, we know that 60% of the cake was eaten. To find 60% of 240, we multiply 240 by 0.6, which is 144.

So, there are 144 cake pieces left.

Now, Juelz divided the remaining pieces among his three sisters. To do this, we need to divide 144 by 3.

144 รท 3 = 48

So, each sister received 48 pieces of cake.
