Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of pancakes Bobby had to start with. The recipe makes 21 pancakes. Bobby ate 5 pancakes. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pancakes left.

Then, his dog ate 7 pancakes. So, he has 16 - 7 = 9 pancakes left.

So, Bobby has 9 pancakes left.
