Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find out how many chairs Ben can build in 8 hours.

Ben works 8 hours, so he can build 1 chair in 8 hours. 1 chair in 8 hours means that he builds 1/8 of a chair in 1 hour.

Now, to find out how many chairs he can build in 10 days, we need to find how many hours are in 10 days.

There are 24 hours in a day. 10 days is equal to 240 hours.

Ben can build 1/8 of a chair in 1 hour, so he can build 1 chair in 8 hours. So, in 240 hours, he can build 240/8 = 30 chairs.

Answer: 30
