Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of cards that were divided by Ellis and Orion.

The ratio of cards given to Ellis and Orion is 11:9. This means that for every 11 cards that Orion got, Ellis got 9 cards.

Let's write an equation to represent this ratio:

Let x be the number of cards that Orion got. Then, we know that the total number of cards is 500.

We can write the equation as follows:

11x = 9x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 9:

x = 500 / 9

x = 55

So, Orion got 55 cards.

Ellis got 500 - 55 cards. To find this number, we can subtract 55 from 500:

500 - 55 = 445

So, Ellis got 445 cards.

Answer: 445
