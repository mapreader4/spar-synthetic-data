Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of minnows with red bellies. We know that 40% of the minnows have red bellies, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the total number of minnows. Then, the number of minnows with red bellies can be represented as 0.4x.

We are given that 20 minnows have red bellies, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

0.4x = 20

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 20 / 0.4
x = 50

So, the total number of minnows is 50.

Now, we know that the total number of minnows is 50 and that 40% have red bellies, so the number of minnows with green bellies is 30% of 50, which is:

0.3 * 50 = 15

The number of minnows with white bellies is the total number of minnows minus the number of minnows with red bellies and green bellies, which is:

50 - 20 - 15 = 15

So, the number of minnows with white bellies is 15.

Answer: 15
