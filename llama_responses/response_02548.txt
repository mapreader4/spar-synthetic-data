Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the number of vessels on the water. The port has 4 cruise ships, and there are twice as many cargo ships. So, the total number of cargo ships is 2 x 4 = 8. 

Now, the number of sailboats is 6 more than the number of cargo ships. So, the number of sailboats is 8 + 6 = 14.

Finally, the number of fishing boats is seven times more than the number of sailboats. So, the number of fishing boats is 14 x 7 = 98.

Adding up the numbers, we get the total number of vessels on the water: 4 + 8 + 14 + 98 = 120.

Answer: 120
