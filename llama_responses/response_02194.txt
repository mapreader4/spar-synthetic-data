Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that the sky has 4 times as many cirrus clouds as cumulus clouds, and 12 times as many cumulus clouds as cumulonimbus clouds. 

Since there are 3 cumulonimbus clouds, we know that the sky has 12 times as many cumulus clouds as cumulonimbus clouds. This means that the sky has 12 cumulus clouds.

We are asked to find out how many cirrus clouds are in the sky at this moment. Since the number of cirrus clouds is 4 times as many as the number of cumulus clouds, we know that the sky has 4 times 12 cumulus clouds. This means that the sky has 48 cumulus clouds.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 48
