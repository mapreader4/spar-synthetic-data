Let's break it down step by step:

There are 25 roses, 40 tulips, and 35 daisies. To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses, tulips, and daisies:

25 + 40 + 35 = 100

The total number of flowers is 100. To find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we need to find the number of flowers that are not roses. Since there are 25 roses, the number of flowers that are not roses is:

100 - 25 = 75

So, the percentage of flowers that are not roses is:

75 / 100 = 75%

Answer: 75
