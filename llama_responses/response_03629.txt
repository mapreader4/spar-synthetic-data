Let's start by identifying the number of roses that are red and the number of roses that are white.

Three-fourths of the 80 roses are red. Three-fourths is equal to 3/4, so the number of red roses is 3/4 * 80 = 60.

One-fourth of the remaining roses are yellow. One-fourth is equal to 1/4, so the number of yellow roses is 1/4 * 80 = 20.

The number of red roses is 60 and the number of yellow roses is 20. To find the total number of red or white roses, we need to add the number of red roses and the number of yellow roses. The total number of red or white roses is 60 + 20 = 80.

Answer: 80
