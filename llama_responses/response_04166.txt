Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find the value of 10 dimes. 10 dimes is the same as 10 x 10 cents, which is 100 cents.

Next, let's find the value of 10 nickels. 10 nickels is the same as 10 x 5 cents, which is 50 cents.

Now, let's find the total value of 100 cents and 50 cents. 100 cents is the same as 150 cents.

So, if Grace exchanges her 10 dimes and 10 nickels, she will have 150 cents. That is 150 pennies.
