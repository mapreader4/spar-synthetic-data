Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Each call lasts 1 hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, each call is charged 60 cents.
2. Ayla talks to 50 customers a week. So, she has 50 phone calls in a week.
3. To find the total cost of the phone bill, we need to multiply the cost per call by the number of calls. 

Cost per call = 60 cents = $0.60
Number of calls = 50

Cost of phone bill = Cost per call x Number of calls = $0.60 x 50 = $30

Answer: 30
