Let's break this down step by step.

The football team had 11 players and each wanted 6 bottles each, so the football team needed 11 x 6 = 66 bottles. The soccer team had 53 bottles. The lacrosse team needed 12 more bottles than the football team, so the lacrosse team needed 66 + 12 = 78 bottles. Each team coach during the season also wanted two bottles apiece, so the coaches needed 2 x 2 = 4 bottles. In total, Daniel filled 66 + 53 + 78 + 4 = 201 bottles for the football, soccer, lacrosse, and coaches. Since he filled 254 water bottles this season, he did not fill any bottles for the rugby team. So, the rugby team had 0 bottles. Answer: 0
