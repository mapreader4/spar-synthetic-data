Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of strawberries Susan can pick without eating any. This is simply the total number of strawberries in the basket, which is 60.

Now, for each handful of 5 strawberries, she eats one. So, for every 5 strawberries she eats 1, that's a total of 1 strawberry. So, to find the total number of strawberries she can pick before eating any, we need to divide the total number of strawberries (60) by 5, and then subtract 1 for each handful.

60 รท 5 = 12

Subtract 1 from 12, because she eats 1 strawberry for each handful, and we get:

12 - 1 = 11

So, Susan will pick 11 strawberries before she fills her basket.
