Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of hens that do lay eggs. Since 15 hens do not lay eggs, that means that 440 - 15 = 425 hens do lay eggs.

Next, each of these 425 hens lays 3 eggs. So, the total number of eggs laid by the hens is 425 * 3 = 1275.

Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by Uncle Ben's hens is 1275.

Answer: 1275
