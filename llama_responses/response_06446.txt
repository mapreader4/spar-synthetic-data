Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of bottles of water the family had. The family bought 24 bottles of water. Then, we can find the number of bottles they drank on the first day by multiplying 1/3 of the total number of bottles by 24, which is 24 * 1/3 = 8. Since they drank 8 bottles on the first day, the number of bottles left after the first day is 24 - 8 = 16.

On the second day, they drank 1/2 of the remaining 16 bottles, which is 16 * 1/2 = 8. So, the total number of bottles they drank is 8 + 8 = 16.

The family has 24 - 16 = 8 bottles of water left after 2 days.
