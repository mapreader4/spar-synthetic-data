Let's first find the total number of students in the classroom. If the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5, then for every 8 students, there are 5 girls. If there are 4 more girls than boys, that means there are 4 girls. So, the total number of students is 4 + 8 = 12. So, the total number of students in the classroom is 12.
