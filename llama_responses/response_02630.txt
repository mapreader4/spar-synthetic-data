Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Carter wants to stop every 2 hours. So, we need to find the number of 2-hour intervals in the total 14-hour trip.

To do this, we can divide 14 hours by 2:

14 รท 2 = 7

So, Carter will make 7 stops for stretching his legs.

2. He also wants to make 2 additional stops for food and 3 additional stops for gas. That's a total of 5 additional stops.

So, we need to add the 7 stops for stretching his legs to the 5 additional stops:

7 + 5 = 12

3. Each pit stop takes 20 minutes. Since there are 12 stops in total, the total time spent on pit stops will be:

12 x 20 minutes = 240 minutes

4. To convert the total time spent on pit stops from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

240 รท 60 = 4

So, the total time spent on pit stops is 4 hours.

5. Finally, we add the total time spent on pit stops to the original 14-hour trip:

14 + 4 = 18

Answer: 18
