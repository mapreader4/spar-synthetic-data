Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: First, we need to find the current property tax Jenny is paying. The tax rate is 2%, so the current property tax is 2% of the current house value, which is 2% of 400,000, which is 8,000.

Step 2: The new rail project will increase the house value by 25%. So, the new house value will be 1.25 x 400,000, which is 500,000. The total property tax will be 2% of the new house value, which is 2% of 500,000, which is 10,000.

Step 3: Jenny can afford to spend 15,000 per year on property tax, so the total property tax will be 15,000 per year. Since the new property tax will be 10,000, Jenny can afford to spend up to 15,000 - 10,000 = 5,000.

Answer: 5,000
