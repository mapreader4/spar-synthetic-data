Let's break down the problem step by step.

Monica studied for 2 hours on Wednesday. She studied three times as long on Thursday, so she studied 3 * 2 = 6 hours on Thursday. On Friday, she studied half of the time she studied on Thursday, which is 6/2 = 3 hours.

In total, Monica studied 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 hours on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
