Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the capacity of one container filled with water. If one container has a capacity of 20 liters and it is filled with water, it means that it contains 20 liters of water.

To find the capacity of 40 such containers, we can multiply the capacity of one container by 40. So, the capacity of 40 containers filled with water would be:

20 * 40 = 800

So, the answer is:

Answer: 800
