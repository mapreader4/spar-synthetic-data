Let's break it down step by step:

The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute, so it will hop 15 meters in one minute.
The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute, so it will hop 12 meters in one minute.
To find the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes, we need to multiply the distance the white rabbit hops in one minute by the number of minutes. The white rabbit hops 15 meters in one minute, and there are 5 minutes in 5 minutes. So, we multiply 15 x 5 = 75.

Answer: 75
