Let's break down the problem step by step.

Barbara bought 5 packs of tuna for $2 each, so the cost of the tuna is 5 * 2 = 10 dollars.

Barbara also bought 4 bottles of water for $1.5 each, so the cost of the water is 4 * 1.5 = 6 dollars.

The total cost of the tuna and water is 10 + 6 = 16 dollars.

Barbara paid a total of $56, which is 56 - 16 = 40 more than the cost of the tuna and water.
