Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate the interest after one year. The interest will be 10% of 100, which is 10.

So, after one year, the amount in the bank account will be 100 + 10 = 110.

Now, we need to calculate the interest for the second year. The interest will be 10% of 110, which is 11.

So, the amount in the bank account after two years will be 110 + 11 = 121.

Answer: 121
