Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the queen has 12500 bees at the beginning.

At the end of the first day, the queen loses 900 bees, so there are 12500 - 900 = 12300 bees left.

At the end of the second day, the queen loses another 900 bees, so there are 12300 - 900 = 12100 bees.

At the end of the third day, the queen loses another 900 bees, so there are 12100 - 900 = 11800 bees.

At the end of the fourth day, the queen loses another 900 bees, so there are 11800 - 900 = 11500 bees.

At the end of the fifth day, the queen loses another 900 bees, so there are 11500 - 900 = 11300 bees.

At the end of the sixth day, the queen loses another 900 bees, so there are 11300 - 900 = 11000 bees.

At the end of the seventh day, the queen loses another 900 bees, so there are 11000 - 900 = 10900 bees.

At the end of 7 days, there are 10900 bees, including the queen.

Answer: 10900
