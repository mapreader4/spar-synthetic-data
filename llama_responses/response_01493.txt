Let's break this problem down step by step.

The family drives the first 100 miles in 1 hour, so they are traveling at a rate of 100 miles per hour.

After stopping at the McDonald's, they continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. Since they have already driven 100 miles, they are left with 300 - 100 = 200 miles to go.

To find the total number of hours it takes to drive the remaining 200 miles, we can divide 200 by the rate of 100 miles per hour:

200 miles / 100 miles per hour = 2 hours

So, the total number of hours they traveled is:
