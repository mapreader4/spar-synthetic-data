Let's break it down step by step.

Kat trains in the gym 3 times a week for 1 hour each time. So, the total hours she trains in the gym is 3 x 1 = 3 hours.

She also trains at the boxing gym 4 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. So, the total hours she trains at the boxing gym is 4 x 1.5 = 6 hours.
