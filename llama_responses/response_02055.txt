Let's think step by step. Let's start by identifying how much money Connor makes in one hour. We know that Connor makes $7.20 per hour. To find out how much Sarah makes in an 8-hour day, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours in the day.

Sarah makes 5 times more money than Connor. This means that Sarah's hourly rate is 5 * 7.20 = 36.00. So, if Sarah works for 8 hours, she makes 36.00 * 8 = 288.00. 

Answer: 288.00
