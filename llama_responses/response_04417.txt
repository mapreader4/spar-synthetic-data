Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Levi has scored 8 times.
* His brother has scored 12 times.
* Levi wants to beat his brother by at least 5 baskets.

We can find the difference between the number of times his brother has scored and the number of times Levi has scored:

12 - 8 = 4

This means Levi's brother has scored 4 more times than Levi.

Levi wants to beat his brother by at least 5 baskets, so he needs to score at least 5 more times. Since his brother has already scored 4 more times, Levi needs to score:

4 + 5 = 9

So, Levi needs to score 9 more times to reach his goal.
