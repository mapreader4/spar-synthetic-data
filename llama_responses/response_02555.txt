Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: The moon is made of 50% iron, 20% carbon, and the remainder is other elements. This means that the remainder is 100% - 50% - 20% = 30%.

The moon's mass is 1.62 x 10^24 kilograms. Mars weighs twice as much as the moon, so Mars is 3.24 x 10^24 kilograms.

We know that Mars is 150 tons of other elements. 1 ton is 1000 kilograms, so Mars is 150,000,000 kilograms.

Now, let's convert 150,000,000 kilograms to kilograms: 150,000,000,000 kilograms = 150,000,000,000,000 grams.

Now, let's divide 150,000,000,000,000 grams by the mass of the moon: 150,000,000,000,000,000,000 grams / 1.62 x 10^24 = 92.16.

Answer: 92.16
