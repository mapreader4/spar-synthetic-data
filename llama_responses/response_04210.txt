Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Margaret wants to serve 2 sandwiches to each person on the committee. So, the total number of sandwiches needed is 24 * 2 = 48.
2. The bakery offers 12 mini croissants for $8.00. To find the cost per croissant, we need to divide 8.00 by 12. 8.00 / 12 = 0.67.
3. Since Margaret wants to buy 48 croissants, the total cost will be 0.67 * 48 = 32.40.

Answer: 32.40
