Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the total number of berries is 42. Let's also say that half of the berries are raspberries, which is 21 berries. This is because 21 is half of 42.

Let's say the number of blackberries is a third of the total berries, which is 14 berries. This is because 14 is a third of 42.

Now, we can subtract the number of raspberries and blackberries from the total number of berries to find the number of blueberries. We can subtract 21 + 14 from 42 to get the number of blueberries.

21 + 14 = 35.

So, the number of blueberries is 35.
