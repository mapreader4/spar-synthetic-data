Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. A mosquito sucks 20 drops of blood every time it feeds on someone. So, to lose 1 liter of blood, it would take 5000 / 20 = 250 mosquitoes.
2. To lose 3 liters of blood, it would take 3 x 250 = 750 mosquitoes.
3. So, to lose 3 liters of blood, 750 mosquitoes would have to feed on you.
