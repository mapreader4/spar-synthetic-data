Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of students who are walking home.

We know that 20 students ride the school bus home together, so they are not walking home.

We also know that 5/8 of the remaining students ride their own bike home. To find the number of students who are not riding a bike, we subtract 20 from the total number of students, 92, and then multiply the result by 5/8. This gives us:

(92 - 20) * (5/8) = 55

So, 55 students are not riding a bike.

Now, we know that the total number of students is 92, and 20 are riding the school bus home, and 55 are not riding a bike. To find the number of students who are walking home, we subtract 20 and 55 from the total number of students, 92:

92 - 20 - 55 = 17

Answer: 17
