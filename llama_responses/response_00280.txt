Let's break this down step by step.

The boy bought 6 cards from the first box, which costs $1.25 per card. So the total cost of the cards from the first box is:

6 x $1.25 = $7.50

The boy also bought 6 cards from the second box, which costs $1.75 per card. So the total cost of the cards from the second box is:

6 x $1.75 = $10.50

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the cards from both boxes:

$7.50 + $10.50 = $17.00

So, the total cost of the cards the boy bought is $17.00.
