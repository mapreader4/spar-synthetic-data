Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total cost of the items Leon purchased. He bought 3 sets of toy organizers for $78 each, so the total cost of the toy organizers is 3 x 78 = 234. He also bought 2 gaming chairs for $83 each, so the total cost of the gaming chairs is 2 x 83 = 166. The total cost of all the items is 234 + 166 = 400.

The delivery fee is 5% of the total sales. To find the delivery fee, we need to find 5% of the total cost, which is 5% of 400. 5% of 400 is 0.05 x 400 = 20.

So, the total amount Leon paid is the total cost of the items plus the delivery fee. The total cost of the items is 400, and the delivery fee is 20. The total amount Leon paid is 400 + 20 = 420.

Answer: 420
