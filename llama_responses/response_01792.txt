Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of roses, daisies, snapdragons, and lilies needed for each table. 

Roses: 8
Daisies: 12
Snapdragons: 3
Lilies: 2 * 3 = 6

Now, we need to multiply the number of each type of flower by the number of tables.

Roses: 8 * 10 = 80
Daisies: 12 * 10 = 120
Snapdragons: 3 * 10 = 30
Lilies: 6 * 10 = 60

Now, we need to add all the flowers together.

80 + 120 + 30 + 60 = 250

Answer: 250
