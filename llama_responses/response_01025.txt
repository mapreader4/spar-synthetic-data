To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of parents who disagree with the tuition fee increase.

The total number of parents is 800. The percentage of parents who agree to the tuition fee increase is 100% - 20% = 80%. This means that the number of parents who disagree is 800 - 800 * 0.8 = 20.

Answer: 20
