Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of items to be divided among the 16 kids.

64 pretzels + 4 times as many goldfish, which is 64 + 64 = 128 items.
Add the 32 suckers to get a total of 160 items.

Now, we need to divide this 160 items into 16 baggies.

To do this, we can divide 160 by 16, which is 160 รท 16 = 10.
