Let's start by using the given information to set up an equation.

The sum of the three sides of a triangle is 50. Let's represent the length of the left side as "x". Then, the length of the right side is 2 cm longer than the left side, so the length of the right side is x + 2 cm.

The equation is:

x + (x + 2) = 50

We can solve this equation by subtracting x from both sides by x:

x + x = 50 - 2

This simplifies to:

x = 48

So, the value of the triangle base is 12 cm.

Answer: 12
