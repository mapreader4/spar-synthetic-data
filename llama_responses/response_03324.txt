Let's break this problem down step by step.

Monica and Sheila start with $50. They spend $12 on toilet paper, so they have:

$50 - $12 = $38

They then spend twice the cost of the toilet paper on groceries, which is:

$12 x 2 = $24

So they spend a total of $24 + $12 = $36 on toilet paper and groceries. They have:

$50 - $36 = $14 left over.

They are allowed to use this amount to buy something for themselves, and they want to buy a pair of boots that costs 3 times the amount they have left. So, the cost of the boots is:

$14 x 3 = $42

They want to buy two pairs of boots, so the total cost is:

$42 x 2 = $84

Since they want to split the cost evenly, they will each need to pay:

$84 รท 2 = $42

They have $14 left over, so they will need to add:

$42 - $14 = $28

to their own money to buy the boots.
