Let's start by identifying the original amount of money Sid had. Since he spent some money on snacks and only has $4 more than half of his original money left, we can set up an equation.

Let x be the original amount of money Sid had. Then, let's say he spent y on computer accessories. Then, he has (x - y) left, which is also 4 more than half of his original money.

We know that half of his original money is (x / 2). So, we can set up the equation:

x - y = (x / 2) + 4

We are given that Sid spent 8 on snacks, so we can substitute that into the equation:

x - y = (x / 2) + 4
x - (x - 8) = (x / 2) + 4
x - x + 8 = (x / 2) + 4
-x + 8 = (x / 2) + 4

Now, we can solve for x - x + 8:

-x = (x / 2) + 4 - 8
-x = (x / 2) - 4

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 8

So, Sid spent $8 on computer accessories.
