Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total cost of the 7 items, each of which costs $200.

7 items * $200 = 1400

Since the total cost is over $1000, we can calculate the discount as 10% of 1400.

10% of 1400 = 140

So, the discount is $140.

To find the cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

1400 - 140 = 1260

Answer: 1260
