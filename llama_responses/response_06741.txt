Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of episodes in the series. Since each season has 20 episodes, and there are 12 seasons, we can find the total number of episodes by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 * 12 = 240

So, the total number of episodes is 240.

Now, since Cesar has watched 1/3 of the series, or 80 episodes, we can find the remaining episodes by subtracting 80 from the total number of episodes.

240 - 80 = 160

Answer: 160
