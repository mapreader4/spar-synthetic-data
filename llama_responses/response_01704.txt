Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the number of mushrooms: Grandma put 3 mushrooms on her salad.

Next, she added twice as many cherry tomatoes as mushrooms, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 cherry tomatoes.

Then, she added 4 times as many pickles as cherry tomatoes, so that's 6 x 4 = 24 pickles.

Finally, she added 4 times as many bacon bits as pickles, so that's 24 x 4 = 96 bacon bits.

Now, one third of the bacon bits were red, so we need to find one third of 96. To do that, we can divide 96 by 3: 96 รท 3 = 32.

So, Grandma put 32 red bacon bits on her salad.

Answer: 32
