Let's break this down step by step.

Will's breakfast provided him 900 calories of energy.

After he decided to jog for half an hour, which used up 10 calories of energy per minute.

So, the total calories used for jogging is 30 * 10 = 300.

Will's net calorie intake after jogging is the total calories he had initially minus the calories used for jogging. That is, 900 - 300 = 600.

Answer: 600
