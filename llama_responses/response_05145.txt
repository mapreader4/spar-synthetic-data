Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of boys in the class. Since 40% of the class are boys, and 100% is equal to 100, we can multiply 40 by 100 to find the number of boys: 40 x 100 = 400. So, there are 400 boys in the class.

Next, let's find the number of girls in the class. Since the total number of students is 100, and the number of boys is 400, the number of girls is 100 - 400 = 100 - 400 = 600. So, there are 600 girls in the class.

Now, let's find the total number of students in the class. We have 400 boys and 600 girls. The total number of students is 400 + 600 = 1000.

Now, let's find the total score of all the students. Each boy gets an 80, so the total score of the boys is 400 x 80 = 32000. Each girl gets a 90, so the total score of the girls is 600 x 90 = 54000. The total score of all the students is the sum of the scores of the boys and girls, which is 32000 + 54000 = 86000.

Finally, let's find the class average. The total score of all the students is 86000, and the total number of students is 1000. So, the class average is 86000 / 1000 = 86.

Answer: 86
