Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* In 2000, 450,000 people lived in Maryville.
* In 2005, 467,000 people lived in Maryville.

We can find the change in the population by subtracting the 2000 population from the 2005 population:

2005 population - 2000 population = Change in population

Substituting the given numbers, we get:

467,000 - 450,000 = 17,000

So, the change in the population is 17,000. To find the average number of people added each year, we can divide the change in population by the number of years:

Change in population / Number of years = Average annual change

Substituting the numbers, we get:

17,000 / 5 = 3,400

So, the average number of people added each year is 3,400.
