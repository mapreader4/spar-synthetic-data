Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Oli has x scoops of ice cream.

Victoria has twice as many scoops as Oli, so she has 2x scoops of ice cream.

So, the difference between Victoria's scoops and Oli's scoops is 2x - x.

We know that Oli has 4 scoops, so 2x - 4 = 2x - 4 = 2x - 4.

We need to find the value of 2x - 4 to find out how many scoops more Victoria has than Oli.

To do this, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation to get 2x = 4 + 4.

This simplifies to 2x = 8.

So, the value of x is 4.

Victoria has 4 + 2 = 6 scoops of ice cream, which is 2 more than Oli.
