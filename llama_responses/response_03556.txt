Let's break it down step by step:

Kathleen saved $21 in June, $46 in July, and $45 in August, so she has a total of $21 + $46 + $45 = $112.

Then, Kathleen spent $12 on school supplies and $54 on new clothes, so she spent a total of $12 + $54 = $66.

So, Kathleen had $112 and spent $66, leaving her with $112 - $66 = $46.

Since Kathleen's aunt said she would give Kathleen $25 if Kathleen saves more than $125, and Kathleen has $46, she doesn't meet the condition to receive the $25. Kathleen's aunt won't give her the $25.

So, Kathleen has $46.
