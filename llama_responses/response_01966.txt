Let's break this down step by step.

Selina sells 3 pairs of pants for $5 each, which is 3 x $5 = $15. She sells 5 pairs of shorts for $3 each, which is 5 x $3 = $15. So, she has a total of $15 + $15 = $30. She then buys 2 shirts for $10 each, which is 2 x $10 = $20. So, she spends $20. After getting her money, she has $30 - $20 = $10 left.

She spends all of this money, so she must have sold the remaining $10 to the store. Since each shirt costs $4, she must have sold 10 / 4 = 2.5 shirts. Since you can't sell a fraction of a shirt, she must have sold 2 shirts.
