Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of bags of potatoes sold. The shop sold 29 bags in the morning and 17 bags in the afternoon. So the total number of bags sold is 29 + 17 = 46.

Next, we need to find the total weight of potatoes sold. Each bag of potatoes weighs 7kg. So the total weight of potatoes sold is 46 * 7 = 322kg.

So, the shop sold 322kg of potatoes in total.
