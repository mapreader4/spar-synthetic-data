Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total weight of the original 80-pound block of marble.

The first statue weighs 10 pounds, so we subtract that from the total weight to get the remaining weight of the marble.

80 - 10 = 70

The second statue weighs 18, so we subtract that from the remaining weight to get the remaining weight of the marble.

70 - 18 = 52

The remaining two statues weigh the same amount, so we divide the remaining weight by 2 to get the weight of each statue.

52 / 2 = 26

So, the remaining two statues each weigh 26 pounds.
