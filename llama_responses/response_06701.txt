Let's break this down step by step. 

Prudence sleeps 6 hours a night from Sunday to Thursday.  That is 6 * 7 = 42 hours.  She sleeps 9 hours a night from Friday to Saturday.  That is 9 * 1 = 9 hours.  She also sleeps for 1 hour on Saturday and Sunday.  That is 1 * 2 = 2 hours.  So in total, she sleeps 42 + 9 + 2 = 53 hours in a week.  4 weeks is 4 * 7 = 28 days.  So she sleeps 53 * 4 = 212 hours in 4 weeks.  So her total sleep is 212 hours.  That is 212 hours. 

Answer: 212
