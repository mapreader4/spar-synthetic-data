Let's start by identifying the number of shirts Hazel received. Hazel received 6 shirts. Then, we know that Razel received twice the number of shirts Hazel received. So, Razel received 2 x 6 = 12 shirts.

To find the total number of shirts the twins have in total, we add the number of shirts Hazel received to the number of shirts Razel received. So, the total number of shirts is 6 + 12 = 18.
