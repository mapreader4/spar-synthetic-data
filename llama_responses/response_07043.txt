Let's break down Stephanie's bills and payments:

Electricity bill: $60, fully paid, so no more payment needed.

Gas bill: $40, three-quarters paid, which is $30. She makes another payment of $5, so a total of $35 has been paid. Remaining amount to pay is $40 - $35 = $5.

Water bill: $40, half paid, which is $20. Remaining amount to pay is $40 - $20 = $20.

Internet bill: $25, 4 payments of $5 made, which is a total of $20. Remaining amount to pay is $25 - $20 = $5.

In total, Stephanie still needs to pay $5 for the gas bill, $20 for the water bill, and $5 for the internet bill. To find the total amount, I add these up:

$5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Answer: 30
