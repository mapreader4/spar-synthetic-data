Let's break this down step by step.

1. The city has a population of 300,000 people initially.
2. 50,000 people immigrate to the country, so the new population is 300,000 + 50,000 = 350,000.
3. Then, 30,000 people leave, so the new population is 350,000 - 30,000 = 320,000.
4. 1/8 of the population gets pregnant, so 320,000 * 1/8 = 40,000 people get pregnant.
5. 1/4 of those people have twins, so 40,000 * 1/4 = 10,000 have twins.
6. The total number of people who get pregnant is 40,000, so the total number of people in the population is 320,000 + 40,000 = 360,000.

Answer: 360,000
