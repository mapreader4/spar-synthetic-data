Let's break this problem down step by step.

It takes Roque 2 hours to walk to work and 1 hour to ride his bike to work. So, to walk to work, it takes Roque 2 hours. And to ride his bike to work, it takes Roque 1 hour. So, in total, it takes Roque 2 + 1 = 3 hours to get to work.

Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week and rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week. So, to walk to and from work, it takes Roque 3 x 2 = 6 hours. To ride his bike to and from work, it takes Roque 2 x 1 = 2 hours. So, in total, it takes Roque 6 + 2 = 8 hours to get to and from work.

In total, Roque takes 3 + 8 = 11 hours to get to and from work a week. So, the answer is:

Answer: 11
