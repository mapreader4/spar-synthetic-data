Let's break this down step by step!

First, Emily watches 3 TV episodes that are each 25 minutes long. This means she watches a total of 3 x 25 = 75 minutes.

Next, she sleeps for 4 and a half hours, which is equal to 4.5 x 60 = 270 minutes.

Then, she watches 2 movies that are each an hour and 45 minutes long. This means she watches a total of 2 x (60 + 45) = 2 x 105 = 210 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time Emily has spent doing these activities:

75 (TV episodes) + 270 (sleep) + 210 (movies) = 555 minutes

The flight is 10 hours long, which is equal to 10 x 60 = 600 minutes.

Since Emily has already spent 555 minutes doing activities, she has:

600 (total flight time) - 555 (time spent doing activities) = 45 minutes

left before she reaches Hawaii.

Answer: 45
