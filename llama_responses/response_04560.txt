Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. This means that James writes a comic every 1 day for 4 times. So, to find the total number of comics written, we need to multiply the number of days (1) by the number of years (4).

1 * 4 = 4

So, James has written 4 * 4 = 16 comics.
