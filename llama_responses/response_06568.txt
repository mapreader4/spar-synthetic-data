Let's start by determining the total amount of dog food that Aunt Gemma has. Each dog can consume 250 grams of food per meal, so in a day, they can consume 2500 grams of food. Since Aunt Gemma feeds them twice a day, they will consume 5000 grams of food per day. Aunt Gemma bought 2 sacks of dog food, each weighing 50 kilograms, so the total weight of the dog food is 100 kilograms. Since there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, we can convert the weight of the dog food to grams by multiplying 1000000. So, the total weight of the dog food is 100000 grams. To find the number of days the food will last, we can divide the total weight of the dog food by the daily amount of food they consume. 100000 grams of dog food divided by 5000 grams is 20. So, the dog food will last for 20 days.
