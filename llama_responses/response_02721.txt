Let's break this problem down step by step.

Felicity gets a lollipop every time her family goes to the store, which is three times a week. So, she gets a total of 3 lollipops per week.

The fort needs 400 sticks to finish it, and it is currently 60% complete. To find the number of sticks she has, we can multiply the total number of sticks needed (400) by the percentage of completion (0.6):

400 x 0.6 = 240

So, Felicity has 240 sticks so far.

Since she gets 3 lollipops per week, we can divide the number of sticks she has by 3 to find the number of weeks she has been collecting lollipops for:

240 รท 3 = 80

Felicity has been collecting lollipops for 80 weeks.
