Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the candies.

2 pieces of Snickers cost $1.5 each, so the total cost of the Snickers is 2 * $1.5 = $3.00.
A pack of M&M's costs the same as 2 Snickers, which is $3.00, so the total cost of the M&M's is 3 * 3.00 = $9.00.
The total cost of the candies is 3.00 + 9.00 = $12.00.

Now, Julia gave the cashier 2 $10 bills. So, she got a change of $12.00 - 2 * $10.00 = $2.00.
