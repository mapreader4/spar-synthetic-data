Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Du Chin sells 200 meat pies at $20 each. That's a total revenue of 200 x 20 = $4000. He uses 3/5 of the sales to buy ingredients to make meat pies for the next day. So, he sets aside 3/5 of 4000 = 240. So, he has 4000 - 240 = 3760 left.

Answer: 3760
