Let's break this down step by step:

1. Each box contains 8 bags of balloons.
2. Each bag contains 12 balloons.
3. There are 5 boxes of balloons.

To find the total number of balloons, we need to multiply the number of balloons in each bag by the number of bags in each box. 

Number of balloons in each bag: 12
Number of bags in each box: 8

Multiply the two numbers together:

12 * 8 = 96

Answer: 96
