Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Ariel was born in 1992.
2. She has been fencing for 16 years.
3. To find Ariel's current age, we need to add 16 to her birth year.

So, if Ariel was born in 1992 and has been fencing for 16 years, she is now 1992 + 16 = 2008 years old.

Answer: 2008
