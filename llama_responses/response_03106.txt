Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many kilograms of tomatoes Marta had after the store was closed on Saturday. After selling 300 kg of tomatoes, she had 1000 - 300 = 700 kg of tomatoes left.

On Monday, another shipment of 2000 kg of tomatoes arrived. We can add this to the amount of tomatoes Marta had already had, so the total amount of tomatoes is 700 + 2000 = 2700 kg.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 2700
