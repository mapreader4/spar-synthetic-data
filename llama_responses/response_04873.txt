Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the time it takes the rabbit to run 24 miles. We know that the rabbit can run at a rate of 15 miles per hour. So, the time it takes the rabbit to run 24 miles is 24 / 15 = 1.6 hours.

The dog, on the other hand, is trying to catch up to the rabbit. The rabbit has a head start of 0.6 miles. This means that the dog needs to cover this distance to catch up to the rabbit.

The dog can run at a rate of 24 miles per hour. So, the time it takes the dog to cover the distance of 0.6 miles is 0.6 / 24 = 0.025 hours.

Now, to find the total time it takes for the dog to catch up to the rabbit, we add the time it takes the rabbit to run 24 miles to the time it takes the dog to cover the head start. So, the total time is 1.6 + 0.025 = 1.625 hours.

Answer: 96 minutes
