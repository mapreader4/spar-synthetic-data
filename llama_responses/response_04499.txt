Let's break down Maisy's current job and the new job separately.

Maisy's current job:

* Hours worked per week: 8 hours
* Wage per hour: $10
* Weekly wage: 8 hours x $10 per hour = $80

Now, let's calculate Maisy's new job:

* Hours worked per week: 4 hours
* Wage per hour: $15
* Weekly wage: 4 hours x $15 per hour = $60

Since Maisy is confident she will exceed her quota, she will receive an additional bonus of $35 per week. So, her total weekly wage at the new job will be:

* $60 (wage) + $35 (bonus) = $95

To find out how much more money Maisy will earn at her new job, we subtract her current weekly wage from her new weekly wage:

* $95 (new job) - $80 (current job) = $15
