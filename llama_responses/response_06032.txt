Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the 2 chairs. Since each chair cost the same amount, we can call this amount x. So, the total cost of the 2 chairs is 2x.

The total amount Nadine spent is $56. The total cost of the table is $34. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

56 = 34 + 2x

Now, we can solve for x.

x = (56 - 34) / 2
x = 11

So, one chair cost 11 dollars.
