Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many hours Austin works in a week. He works 2 hours on Monday, 1 hour on Wednesday, and 3 hours on Friday. So, that is a total of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 hours in a week.

Now, Austin receives $5 for every hour he works. So, his weekly income is 6 * 5 = 30 dollars.

The bicycle costs $180. So, Austin needs to work for 180 / 5 = 36 weeks to earn enough money to buy the bicycle.
