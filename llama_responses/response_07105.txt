Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of people in Richmond is R. Then, the number of people in Victoria is 4R. We know that the number of people in Victoria is 4R. We are given that the number of people in Richmond is 1000 more than the number of people in Victoria. So, we can set up the equation 4R = 1000 + R. We can subtract 1000 from both sides of the equation to get 4R - 1000 = R. So, R = -1000. So, the number of people in Richmond is 1000 less than the number of people in Victoria. We know that the number of people in Beacon is 4R, so we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get 4R * 4 = 4R. So, the number of people in Beacon is 4000.

Answer: 4000.
