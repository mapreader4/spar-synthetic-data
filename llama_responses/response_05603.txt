Let's break it down step by step.

James' original speed is 150 mph. After supercharging his car, the speed increases by 30%, so the new speed is:

150 mph x (1 + 0.3) = 195 mph

Then, he cuts weight by 15%, which means the speed increases by a further 10 mph. The new speed is:

195 mph + 10 mph = 205 mph

Answer: 205
