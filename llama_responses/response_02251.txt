Let's break this down step by step.

Tom spends $17 on gas.  So, the amount of money he has left for mowing lawns is $17.

He mows 3 lawns, and each lawn costs $12.  So, the amount of money he makes from mowing lawns is 3 x $12 = $36.

He also makes $10 from pulling weeds.  So, the total amount of money he makes from both mowing lawns and pulling weeds is $36 + $10 = $46.

Therefore, Tom's profit is $46.
