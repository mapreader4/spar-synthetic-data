Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the peaches.

Michael needs 5 pies that require 3 pounds of peaches each. 3 x 3 = 9 pounds of peaches.  9 pounds of peaches will cost 9 x 2.00 = 18.00 dollars.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the blueberries.

Michael needs 3 blueberry pies that require 3 pounds of blueberries each. 3 x 3 = 9 pounds of blueberries.  9 pounds of blueberries will cost 9 x 1.00 = 9.00 dollars.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the apples.

Michael needs 4 apple pies that require 3 pounds of apples each. 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of apples. 12 pounds of apples will cost 12 x 1.00 = 12.00 dollars.

Step 4: Add the costs.

The total cost of the peaches is 18.00, the total cost of the blueberries is 9.00, and the total cost of the apples is 12.00. 18.00 + 9.00 + 12.00 = 39.00.
