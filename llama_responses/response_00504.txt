Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how much money Sam has saved up from March to August:

From March to August, Sam made $460 doing 23 hours of yard work. So, the hourly rate is:

$460 / 23 hours = $20 per hour

Now, let's find out how much money Sam has saved up:

From September to February, Sam was able to work for 8 hours. So, he earned:

$20 per hour * 8 hours = $160

Sam has already spent $340 to fix his car, so he has:

$460 - $340 = $120 left

He needs to save up $600 - $120 = $480 more to buy the video game console.

To find out how many more hours Sam needs to work to save $480, we can divide the amount needed by his hourly rate:

$480 / $20 per hour = 24 hours

So, Sam needs to work for 24 more hours to save up enough money to buy the video game console.

Answer: 24
