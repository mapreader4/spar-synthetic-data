Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's first find out how much more money Peter needs to save.

Peter has $5,000 he needs and has $2,900 in savings, so he needs $5,000 - $2,900 = $2,100 more.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how much Peter can save each month.

Peter can save $700 each month.

Step 3: To find out how many months Peter needs to wait, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($2,100) by the amount he can save each month ($700).

$2,100 รท $700 = 3
