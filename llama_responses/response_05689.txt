Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the rate at 1 bunny's rate of coming out of its burrow, which is 3 times per minute. This means that in 1 minute, 3 bunnies will come out of their burrows.

Now, if we have 20 bunnies, we can multiply the rate of 3 bunnies per minute by the number of minutes in 10 hours to find the total number of bunnies that will come out of their burrows.

To do this, we can multiply 3 bunnies per minute by 60 minutes, which is the number of minutes in 1 hour. This gives us:

3 bunnies/minute * 60 minutes = 180 bunnies

Now, we have 20 bunnies. We can multiply 180 bunnies by the number of hours in 10 hours:

180 bunnies * 10 hours = 1800 bunnies

So, the combined number of times 20 bunnies at the same pace will come out of their burrows in 10 hours is 1800. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 1800
