Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what we know:

* Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia.
* Julia has a third as many video games as Tory.
* Tory has 6 video games.

From the first statement, we know that Theresa has 5/3 times as many video games as Julia. We can write this as an equation:

5x = 3y

We know that y is the number of video games Julia has. Since Julia has 6 video games, we can substitute y with 2:

5x = 3(2)

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15

Now, we know that Theresa has 15 video games.
