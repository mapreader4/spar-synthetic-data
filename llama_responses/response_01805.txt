Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Giselle had 20 female doves initially.
Step 2: After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. So, the total number of eggs laid is 20 * 3 = 60 eggs.
Step 3: If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, then 3/4 of 60 eggs hatched. To find the total number of doves Giselle has, we need to multiply 3/4 by 60.

3/4 of 60 is 45.

Answer: 20 + 45 = 65
