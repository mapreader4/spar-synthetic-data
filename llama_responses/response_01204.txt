Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the number of solar systems. We know that there are 8 solar systems for every planet in the galaxy. We are told that there are 20 planets in the galaxy. So, we can multiply the number of solar systems by the number of planets to find the total number of solar systems:

8 solar systems per planet * 20 planets = 160

So, there are 160 solar systems in the galaxy.
