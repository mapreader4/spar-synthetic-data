Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of minutes it took for the total number of snowflakes to reach 58.

We know there were 10 snowflakes at the beginning. Then, every 5 minutes, 4 snowflakes are added. So, to find the total number of snowflakes, we can set up an equation.

Let's say the number of minutes is x. Then, we can write the equation as follows:

10 + (4 * (x / 5)) = 58

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us:

10 + 4x = 58 * 5

Then, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get:

4x = 48

Finally, we can divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 12

So, it took 12 minutes for the total number of snowflakes to reach 58.
