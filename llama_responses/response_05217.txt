Let's break this problem down step by step:

Let's say Grant's score be x.

Since Grant scored 10 points more than John, we can set up an equation: x = John's score + 10.

We know John's score is half of Hunter's score, so we can set up another equation: John's score = Hunter's score / 2. We know Hunter scored a 45, so John's score = 45 / 2 = 22.5.

Now we can substitute John's score into the first equation: x = 22.5 + 10.

x = 32.5.

Answer: 32
