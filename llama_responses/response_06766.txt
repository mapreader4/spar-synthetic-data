Let's start by identifying the number of albums each person has.

Miriam has 5 times as many albums as Katrina. This means that Katrina has 5/1 of the albums that Miriam has. So, Katrina has 5 albums.

Katrina has 6 times the number of albums as Bridget. This means that Bridget has 6/1 of the albums that Katrina has. So, Bridget has 6 albums.

Bridget has 15 fewer albums than Adele. So, Adele has 15 + 6 = 21 albums.

Miriam and Katrina together have 5 + 6 = 11 albums. Bridget and Katrina together have 6 albums. So, the total number of albums the three of them together have is 11 + 6 = 17.

The answer is: Answer: 17
