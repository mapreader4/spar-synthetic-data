To find the total commission, we need to multiply the commission on each sale by the price of the house and then add the results. The commission on the first house is 2% of 157,000 which is 0.02 * 157,000 = 3,134. The commission on the second house is 2% of 499,000 which is 0.02 * 499,000 = 9,980. The commission on the third house is 2% of 125,000 which is 0.02 * 125,000 = 2,500. Then, we add the commissions together to get the total commission. 3,134 + 9,980 + 2,500 = 15,714. The answer is: Answer: 15,714.
