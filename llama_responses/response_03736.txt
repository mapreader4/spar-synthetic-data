Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total calories in the salad. The lettuce is 50 calories, and the carrots are twice the calories of the lettuce, so the carrots are 2 x 50 = 100 calories. The dressing is 210 calories. So, the total calories in the salad is 50 + 100 + 210 = 360.

Next, let's calculate the total calories in the pizza. The crust is 600 calories, the pepperoni is 1/3 of the crust's calories, so it is 600 / 3 = 200 calories, and the cheese is 400 calories. The total calories in the pizza is 600 + 200 + 400 = 1200.

Now, let's find the total calories Jackson eats. He eats 1/4 of the salad, which is 360 / 4 = 90 calories. He also eats 1/5 of the pizza, which is 1200 / 5 = 240 calories. The total calories Jackson eats is 90 + 240 = 330.

Answer: 330
