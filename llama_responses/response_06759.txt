Let's break down the time Amaya spent watching the movie and rewinding:

1. First, she watches 35 minutes of the movie.
2. Then, she rewinds the movie, adding 5 minutes to her total time. So, the total time spent watching the movie so far is 35 + 5 = 40 minutes.
3. Next, she watches another 45 minutes of the movie.
4. After that, she rewinds the movie again, adding 15 minutes to her total time. So, the total time spent watching the movie so far is 40 + 45 + 15 = 100 minutes.
5. Finally, she watches the last 20 minutes of the movie uninterrupted.

To find the total time it took Amaya to watch the movie, we add the last 20 minutes to the total time spent watching the movie so far:

100 + 20 = 120 minutes

Answer: 120
