Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of days Jackson ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. He eats sandwiches on Wednesdays and Fridays, and he has missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays. So, the number of days he ate sandwiches is 36 - (1 + 2) = 35.

Next, we need to find the number of sandwiches he ate for lunch. There are 2 sides to a sandwich, so the number of sandwiches is 35 * 2 = 70.

Answer: 70
