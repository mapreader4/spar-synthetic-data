Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total time it takes to wash and dry each load.

For the whites:
- Washing: 72 minutes
- Drying: 50 minutes
Total time for whites: 72 + 50 = 122 minutes

For the darks:
- Washing: 58 minutes
- Drying: 65 minutes
Total time for darks: 58 + 65 = 123 minutes

For the colors:
- Washing: 45 minutes
- Drying: 54 minutes
Total time for colors: 45 + 54 = 99 minutes

To find the total time it takes to wash and dry all three loads, we need to add the time for each load together:

122 minutes (whites) + 123 minutes (darks) + 99 minutes (colors) = 344 minutes

Answer: 344
