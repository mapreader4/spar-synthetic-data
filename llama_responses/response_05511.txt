Let's start by identifying the information given to us:

* Ember is half as old as Nate.
* Nate is 14 years old.

We can let's denote Nate's age as N. Since Ember is half as old as Nate, we can set up an equation to represent this:

N/2 = 14

We can solve for N by multiplying both sides by 2:

N = 2 * 14
N = 28

So, Nate will be 28 years old when Ember is 14 years old.
