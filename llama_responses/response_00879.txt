Let's break it down step by step.

Jake starts with 80 bitcoins.

1. He donates 20 bitcoins to charity, so he has 80 - 20 = 60 bitcoins left.

2. He gives half of the remaining 60 bitcoins to his brother, so he gives 30 bitcoins to his brother.

3. He triples the number of bitcoins he has, so he triples 60 + 30 = 90.

4. He donates 10 more coins, so he has 90 - 10 = 80 bitcoins left.

Answer: 80
