Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that Jay saves $20 this week, and he will increase the amount he saves each week by $10. 

Since he saves $20 this week, that means that he will save $20 + $10 next week. So, he will save $30 next week. 

To find out how much he will save in a month, we need to add up the amount he will save for each week. 

$20 + $10 = $30. So, he will save $30 this week. 

$30 + $10 = $40. So, he will save $40 next week. 

$40 + $10 = $50. So, he will save $50 the week after. 

$50 + $10 = $60. So, he will save $60 the week after that.
