Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the total number of hours Mark will visit the theater in 6 weeks.

Mark visits the theater at least once a week. So, he will visit the theater 6 times in 6 weeks.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Mark will spend in the theater.

Mark visits the theater 6 times in 6 weeks. So, the total number of hours is 6 x 3 = 18 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost of the ticket is $5 per hour. So, the total cost is 18 hours * 5 = 90 dollars.

Answer: 90
