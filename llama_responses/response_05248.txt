Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. John can originally squat 135 pounds.
2. He increases that by 265 pounds, so now he can squat 135 + 265 = 400 pounds.
3. Then, he gets a magical strength-increasing bracer that increases his strength by 600%.
4. So, the bracer multiplies his strength by 1.6, which is 400 * 1.6 = 640 pounds.

Answer: 640
