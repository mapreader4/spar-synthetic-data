Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Jared counted 15% fewer cars than his sister Ann.
* Ann counted 7 more cars than their friend Alfred.
* Jared counted 300 cars.

We can start by using the information that Jared counted 300 cars. We know that Ann counted more cars than Alfred, so we can say that Ann counted a total of 300 + 7 cars. We also know that Jared counted 15% fewer cars than Ann, so we can subtract 15% of 300 from the total number of cars Ann counted. To do this, we can multiply 300 by 15/100 to get the number of cars Jared counted. This gives us 45. Then, we add the 45 cars that Jared counted to the 300 + 7 cars that Ann counted to get the total number of cars they counted. The total is 345 cars.

Answer: 345
