Let's break it down step by step:

Let's start with the number of blue pens. Roy has 2 blue pens.

The problem states that he has "twice as many black and 2 less than twice as many red than black pens." So, if we let x be the number of black pens, then the number of red pens would be 2x.

The problem states that the number of red pens is "2 less than twice as many red than black pens", so the number of red pens is 2x - 2.

Now, we know that the number of black pens is x. The number of red pens is 2x - 2. We can rewrite the equation as 2x - 2 = x. So, we know that 2x = x + 2.

Now, we can substitute x with 2x. We get x = 2x. So, the number of blue pens is 2(2x) = 4x.

The total number of pens is the sum of the number of blue pens, black pens, and red pens. So, the total number of pens is 2 + x + 2x - 2 + 2x = 4x - 2.

The problem asks us to find the total number of pens, which is 4x - 2.

Answer: 4x - 2.
