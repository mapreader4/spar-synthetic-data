Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost per semester. The cost is $20,000 per semester.

Next, we need to determine how many semesters there are in a year. There are 2 semesters in a year.

Now, let's multiply the cost per semester by the number of semesters to find the cost for a year.

$20,000 (per semester) * 2 (semesters) = $40,000

So, the cost to send the kid to 13 years of school is $40,000.
