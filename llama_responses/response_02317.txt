Let's break down the bill step by step.

First, the mom ordered lobster for $25.50.
The dad ordered steak for $35.00.
The twin boys each ordered a cheeseburger and fries for $13.50, so that's a total of $27.00 for the two boys.
The appetizer cost $8.50.
Each person ordered a dessert for $6.00, so that's a total of $24.00 for the desserts.

The total cost of the meal before tip is:

$25.50 + $35.00 + $27.00 + $8.50 + $24.00 = $120.00

To calculate the 20% tip, I'll multiply the total cost by 0.20:

$120.00 x 0.20 = $24.00

The total bill with the 20% tip is:

$120.00 + $24.00 = $144.00
