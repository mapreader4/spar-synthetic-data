Let's break down the information given:

1. Sara spent 50 dollars on a pair of shoes.
2. She also spent 200 dollars on a dress.
3. We want to know how much Rachel should budget if she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent.

To find the amount Rachel should budget, we need to multiply Sara's total spending by 2.

Sara's total spending = 50 + 200 = 250
Rachel should budget 2 * 250 = 500

Answer: 500
