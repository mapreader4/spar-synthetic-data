Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of friends Toby has is x.

We know that 55% of Toby's friends are boys, which is 0.55x.

We also know that the rest of the friends are girls, which is 1 - 0.55x.

We know that the number of boys is 33.

So, 0.55x = 33. We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 100, which gives us:

0.55x * 100 = 3300

Then, we can divide both sides by 0.55 to get x, which is:

x = 600

So, Toby has 600 friends in total.

Answer: 600
