Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of adult tickets. The theatre is full and contains 188 children. Since the cost of an adult ticket is $6, the cost for the 188 children would be 188 * 6 = 1128. But we know there are 250 seats in total, so the number of adult tickets is 250 - 188 = 62. So, the cost for the adult tickets would be 62 * 6 = 372.

Now, we need to add the cost for the adult tickets to the cost for the children. So, the total ticket revenue would be 1128 + 372 = 1500.

Answer: 1500
