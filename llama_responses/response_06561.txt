Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Bob buys 50 feet of rope.
2. He uses a 1/5 of it to make a small piece of art. So, he uses 10 feet.
3. He takes the rest of the rope and gives half of it to the friend. The rest of the rope is 40 feet. Half of 40 is 20.
4. He cuts 2-foot sections. So, he cuts 2 sections from the 20-foot section.

To find the total number of sections, we add the 2 sections he cut from the 20-foot section to the 2 sections he cut in total, which is 2.

Answer: 2
