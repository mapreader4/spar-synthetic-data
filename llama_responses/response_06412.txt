Let's break this down step by step. Let's start by finding the total number of gingerbreads baked in the four trays. Diane bakes 4 trays with 25 gingerbreads in each tray, so that's a total of 4 * 25 = 100 gingerbreads. Then, she also bakes 3 trays with 20 gingerbreads in each tray, which is a total of 3 * 20 = 60 gingerbreads. To find the total number of gingerbreads baked, we add the 100 gingerbreads from the first part to the 60 gingerbreads from the second part, so the total is 100 + 60 = 160 gingerbreads.

Answer: 160
