Let's break it down step by step:

Enrique earns a 15% commission on each piece of clothing item he sells. He sells 2 suits that are $700.00. 2 x 700.00 is 1400.00. He sells 6 shirts that are $50.00 each. 6 x 50.00 is 300.00. He also sells 2 pairs of loafers that are $150.00 each. 2 x 150.00 is 300.00. 

The total commission he earns is 1400.00 + 300.00 + 300.00. The answer is: Answer: 2000.
