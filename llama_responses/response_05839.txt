Let's start by identifying the number of granola bars needed. Since there are 30 kids playing soccer, and Katie's mother wants 2 granola bars for each kid, the total number of granola bars needed is 30 x 2 = 60.

Since each box has 12 granola bars, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to get 60 granola bars. To do this, we can divide the total number of granola bars needed (60) by the number of granola bars per box (12):

60 รท 12 = 5

So, Katie's mother should buy 5 boxes of granola bars.
