Let's break this down step by step.

Roberta starts with $158.

She spends $45 on new shoes. That leaves her with $158 - $45 = $113.

Then she spends $17 on a new bag. That leaves her with $113 - $17 = $96.

Then, she spends a quarter of the price of the bag. The price of the bag is unknown, but we can call it x. So she spends x/4 = $17, which means x = 4 * $17 = $68. So the price of the bag is $68. She spends $68 on the bag. That leaves her with $96 - $68 = $28.

So Roberta has $28 left.

Answer: 28
