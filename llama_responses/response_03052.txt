To solve this problem, I will break it down step by step.

Hannah brought 30 dollars to the county fair. She spent half of it on rides, so that would be 30 / 2 = 15 dollars. She also spent 5 dollars on dessert. 

The total amount spent would be 15 + 5 = 20 dollars. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the amount spent from the original amount. 30 - 20 = 10 dollars.

Answer: 10
