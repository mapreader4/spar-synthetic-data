Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the total amount of money collected from the guests was $5 per person, and Samanta added her own $10. So, the total amount of money collected is:

5 x 12 (from the guests) + 10 (from Samanta herself) = 60

The leftover amount is $15, so the price of the gift must be:

60 - 15 = 45

So, the answer is: Answer: 45.
