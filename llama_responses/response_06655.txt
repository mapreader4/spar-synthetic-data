Let the smallest angle be x degrees. The middle angle is 3x, and the largest angle is 5x. The sum of the three angles is 180, so we have the equation: x + 3x + 5x = 180.

We can solve this equation by solving for x. We can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get: x + 5x = 180 - 3x.

Then, we can subtract 5x from both sides of the equation to get: x = 180 - 5x - 3x.

Finally, we can solve for x by subtracting 180 - 3x from both sides of the equation to get: x = 180 - 5x - 3x - 3x.

This simplifies to x = 180 - 8x.

Since the question asks for the degree of the smallest angle, we need to know the value of x. To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 180 by 8: x = 180 / 8.

x = 22.5.

Answer: 22.5
