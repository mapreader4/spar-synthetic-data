Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's say Drew's age is x.

Sam is half of Drew's age, so Sam's age is x/2.

The problem says that Sam and Drew have a combined age of 54. So, we can set up the equation as x + x/2 = 54.

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get 2x = 108.

Then, we can divide both sides by 2 to get x = 54.

So, Sam is 54/2, which is 27.
