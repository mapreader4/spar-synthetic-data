Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the information given in the problem. We know that Miranda saved money for 3 months. This means that the amount of money she saved is 3 times the amount she saved per month. We know that she paid $260 in total for the heels. We can let's call the amount she saved per month M. So, we can set up the equation:

M * 3 = 260

We can then solve for M by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

M = 260 / 3

M = 86.67

So, Miranda saved $86.67 per month.
