Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of parents who rated their children's online class experience as Excellent, which is 15%. This is given to us as a percentage, so we need to convert it to a fraction. To do this, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, which gives us 0.15.

Next, we are told that 60% of the respondents rated their experience as Very Satisfactory. We can convert this to a decimal by dividing by 100, which gives us 0.6.

Now, we are left with the remaining respondents who did not rate their experience as Excellent or Very Satisfactory. This is the 100% - (15% + 60%) = 100% - 0.15 - 0.6 = 24.5% who rated their experience as Satisfactory.

So, to find the number of parents who rated Needs Improvement, we can multiply the total number of respondents by the percentage that rated Needs Improvement, which is 100% - 24.5%. This gives us:

Answer: 24
