Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. We know that Lucy can clean 2 aquariums in 3 hours. So, the time taken by Lucy to clean 1 aquarium is 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours.

2. We know that Lucy works 24 hours this week. So, the total number of hours she has to clean aquariums is 24 hours.

3. To find out how many aquariums Lucy can clean, we need to divide the total number of hours by the time she takes to clean 1 aquarium. So, the number of aquariums Lucy can clean is 24 hours / 1.5 hours = 16.

Answer: 16
