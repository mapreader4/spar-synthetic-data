Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Jackson's current grade is x.

Since Jackson's grade increases by 15 points for every hour he spends studying, that means that for every 1/3 hours he studies, his grade increases by 5 points.

He spent 1/3 of his time studying, so his grade increases by 5 points for that time. So, his new grade is x + 5.

Now, he spent 9 hours playing video games. That is the same as 9 * 3 = 27 hours. So, his grade increases by 27 * 5 = 135 points.

So, his final grade is x + 135.

We know that Jackson's grade starts at 0 points. So, we can set up an equation: x + 135 = 0.

Subtracting 135 from both sides, we get:

x = -135.

So, the answer is:

Answer: -135
