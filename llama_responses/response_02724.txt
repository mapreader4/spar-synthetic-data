Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that each carrot produces 4 servings of vegetables. Since there are 9 carrot plants, the total number of servings from carrots is:

9 x 4 = 36

We also know that each corn plant produces 5 times as many servings as each carrot. So, each corn plant produces:

4 x 5 = 20

Since there are 9 corn plants, the total number of servings from corn is:

9 x 20 = 180

We know that each green bean plant produces half as many servings as each corn plant. So, each green bean plant produces:

20 / 2 = 10

Since there are 9 green bean plants, the total number of servings from green beans is:

9 x 10 = 90

To find the total number of servings of vegetables, we add the number of servings from carrots, corn, and green beans:

36 + 180 + 90 = 306

Answer: 306
