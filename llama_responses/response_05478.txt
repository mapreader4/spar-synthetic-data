Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, the tank is 2/5 filled with water, which means it has 2/5 Ã— 100 = 40 liters of water.

On the first day, the tank collected 15 liters of water, so the total amount of water in the tank becomes 40 + 15 = 55 liters.

On the second day, the tank collected 5 liters more water than on the first day, so it collected 15 + 5 = 20 liters of water. The total amount of water in the tank becomes 55 + 20 = 75 liters.

On the third day, the tank was already filled, which means it had 100 liters of water. Since the tank had 75 liters before, it must have collected 100 - 75 = 25 liters of water on the third day.

Answer: 25
