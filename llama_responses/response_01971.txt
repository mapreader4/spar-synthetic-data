Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue of the company.

The company makes a revenue of $400000 a month. So, the total revenue is $400000.

Step 2: Calculate the amount paid in taxes.

10% of the revenue is paid in taxes. To find this amount, multiply the revenue by 0.10.

$400000 * 0.10 = $40000

Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on marketing and ads.

5% of the remaining amount is paid on marketing and ads. The remaining amount after taxes is $400000 - $40000 = $360000. To find the amount spent on marketing and ads, multiply the remaining amount by 0.05.

$360000 * 0.05 = $18000

Step 4: Calculate the amount spent on operational costs.

20% of the remaining amount is paid on operational costs. The remaining amount after marketing and ads is $360000 - $18000 = $342000. To find the amount spent on operational costs, multiply the remaining amount by 0.20.

$342000 * 0.20 = $68400

Step 5: Calculate the amount spent on employee wages.

15% of the remaining amount is paid on employee wages. The remaining amount after operational costs is $342000 - $68400 = $273600. To find the amount spent on employee wages, multiply the remaining amount by 0.15.

$273600 * 0.15 = $41040

Step 6: Calculate the amount each employee receives.

The company has 10 employees. To find the amount each employee receives, divide the amount spent on employee wages by the number of employees.

$41040 รท 10 = $4104

Answer: 4104
