Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the original price of the boots: 90 dollars.

Then, let's find the discount percentage: 20%.

To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.20 (20%) * 90 = 18.

So, we subtract the discount from the original price: 90 - 18 = 72.

So, Charlotte should bring 72 dollars to buy the boots.
