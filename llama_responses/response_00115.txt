Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of jelly beans. We know that 3/4 of the jelly beans are red, and 1/4 of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. So, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

Let x be the total number of jelly beans. Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

3/4x = 1/4x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

3/4x * 4 = 1/4x * 4

This simplifies to:

3x = x

So, x = 3x. This means that the total number of jelly beans is 3 times the number of red jelly beans. Since 750 are coconut flavored, we can set up the equation:

750 = 3x

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 750 / 3

x = 250

Answer: 250
