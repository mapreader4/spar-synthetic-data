To solve this problem, we can start by calculating how many gallons of water Aubriella will pour in 1 minute. Since she pours 1 gallon every 20 seconds, in 60 seconds there are 3 times as many pourings. So, in 1 minute, she will pour 3 gallons. In 6 minutes, she will pour 18 gallons. The total amount of gallons she will have to pour in the tank is 50 - 18 = 32 gallons.
