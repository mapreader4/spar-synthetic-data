Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many grams Nathalie ate. If the cake is divided into 8 equal parts, and Nathalie ate one-eighth, then Nathalie ate 400/8 = 50 grams.

Next, we need to find out how much Pierre ate. Pierre ate double what Nathalie ate. So, Pierre ate 2 x 50 = 100 grams.
