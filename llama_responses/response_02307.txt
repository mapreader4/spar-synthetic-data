Let's start by finding the area of the sandbox. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so the area of the sandbox is 3 ft x 3 ft = 9 sq ft. Since each bag of sand covers 3 sq ft, we can find the total number of bags needed by dividing the area of the sandbox by the area per bag. So, the total number of bags needed is 9 sq ft / 3 sq ft per bag = 3 bags.

The cost to fill the sandbox is the total number of bags times the cost per bag. So, the total cost is 3 bags x $4.00 per bag = $12.00.
