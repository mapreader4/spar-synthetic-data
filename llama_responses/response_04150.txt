Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of money Mrs. Thomson started with. We know that she received $240. She spent 1/3 of it on food and 1/5 of it on clothes. So, she spent a total of 1/3 + 1/5 = 4/15 of the money. To find the money she spent, we can subtract 4/15 from 1, which gives us 1 - 4/15 = 7/15. So, she has 7/15 of the original 240 left.

Then, she put 3/4 of the remaining money into her savings account. So, she put in 3/4 of 7/15, which is equal to 21/60. 21/60 is 21/60 of 240, which is the amount of money Mrs. Thomson saved.
