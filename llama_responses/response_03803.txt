Let's break this problem down step by step.

Tom buys 5 shirts from each of his 4 favorite fandoms, so he buys a total of 5 x 4 = 20 shirts.

The shirts normally cost $15 each, so the total cost before the sale would be 20 x 15 = 300 dollars.

However, there is a 20% off sale, so we need to calculate the discount. To do this, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

300 x 0.20 = 60

So the discount is 60 dollars. To find the new price, we subtract the discount from the original price:

300 - 60 = 240

So the total cost after the discount is 240 dollars.

However, Tom still needs to pay 10% tax on the discounted price. To calculate the tax, we multiply the discounted price by the tax percentage:

240 x 0.10 = 24

So the tax is 24 dollars. To find the final total, we add the tax to the discounted price:

240 + 24 = 264

Answer: 264
