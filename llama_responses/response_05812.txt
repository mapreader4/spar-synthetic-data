Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's say the amount of oil in each bottle is x.

We know that the store owner was able to make 20 bottles, and each bottle has x liters of oil. So, we can set up an equation:

20 bottles * x = 200 mL

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 200 รท 20

x = 10

Answer: 10
