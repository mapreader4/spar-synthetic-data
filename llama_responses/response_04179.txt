Let's break this problem down step by step.

Sarah's external drive showed 2.4 gigabytes free and 12.6 gigabytes used. So, the total size of the files on the external drive is 2.4 + 12.6 = 14.6 gigabytes.

Sarah decided to delete a folder of size 4.6 gigabytes. So, the remaining space on the external drive will be 14.6 - 4.6 = 10 gigabytes.

Then, she will transfer all her files to a new external drive of size 20 gigabytes. So, the new external drive will have 10 gigabytes of free space and 20 - 10 = 10 gigabytes of used space.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 10
