Let's break down the information given. Brandon can catch 6 squirrels or 2 rabbits in 1 hour. Let's say he catches squirrels. Each squirrel has 300 calories. So, the total calories from catching 6 squirrels is 6 x 300 = 1800 calories. 

If Brandon catches rabbits instead, each rabbit has 800 calories, so the total calories from catching 2 rabbits would be 2 x 800 = 1600 calories. 

Since Brandon catches 6 squirrels, the calories he gets from catching squirrels is 1800 calories. If he catches rabbits, the calories he gets is 1600. 

The difference in calories is 1800 - 1600 = 200. So, he gets 200 more calories if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. 

Answer: 200
