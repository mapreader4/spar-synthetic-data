Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total number of minutes she can tan in the first two weeks. If she tans 30 minutes a day, that's a total of 2 x 30 = 60 minutes in the first week. In the second week, she will tan another 30 minutes a day, so that's 2 x 30 = 60 minutes. In total, she can tan 60 + 60 = 120 minutes in the first two weeks.

Now, we need to subtract the minutes she has already tanned in the first two weeks from the total minutes she can tan in a month. She can tan 200 minutes in a month. So, we subtract 120 from 200, which gives us 80. 

Answer: 80
