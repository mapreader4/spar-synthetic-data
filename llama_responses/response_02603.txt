Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Mandy has M toys. Then, Anna has 3M toys. Amanda has 2 fewer toys than Anna, so Anna has 3M - 2 = 3M - 2 toys. We know that Anna and Mandy have 142 toys together, so M + (3M - 2) = 142. We can solve for M. M + (3M - 2) = 142. M = 142 + 2. M = 144.

Answer: 144
