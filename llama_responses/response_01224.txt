Let's break this down step by step:

Jim starts with $80 in his investment portfolio.

After 1 year, his portfolio grows by 15%, so his new portfolio value is:

80 + (80 x 0.15) = 92

Then, he adds another $28 to his portfolio, so his new portfolio value is:

92 + 28 = 120

After 1 more year, the combined portfolio grows by 10%. So, we multiply the new portfolio value by 1.1 (which is the same as multiplying by 110%):

120 x 1.1 = 132

So, his final portfolio value after 2 years is:

Answer: 132
