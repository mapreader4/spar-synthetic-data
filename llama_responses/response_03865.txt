Let's break down the problem step by step.

Faye had $20 initially.

Her mother gave her twice as much as her money. So, Faye received $40.

Faye bought 10 cupcakes at $1.50 each. So, she spent 10 x $1.50 = $15 on cupcakes.

Faye also bought 5 boxes of cookies at $3 per box. So, she spent 5 x $3 = $15 on cookies.

In total, Faye spent $15 + $15 = $30.

So, Faye has $40 - $30 = $10 left.

Answer: 10
