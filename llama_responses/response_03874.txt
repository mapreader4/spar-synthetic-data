Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Sara makes 4 cakes a day, and there are 5 days in a week. So, in a week, Sara makes 5 * 4 = 20 cakes.

Step 2: Sara sells each cake for $8. So, in a week, she sells 20 cakes * 8 = 160 dollars.

Step 3: Sara does this for 4 weeks. So, in 4 weeks, she sells 4 * 20 * 8 = 640 dollars.

Answer: 640
