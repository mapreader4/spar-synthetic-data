Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jerry can run from his house to his school and back in the time it takes his brother Carson to run to the school. This means that Jerry runs a round trip. Since it takes Jerry 15 minutes to make a one-way trip from his house to his school and the school is 4 miles away, we know that the round trip distance is 8 miles.

The distance Jerry runs in the round trip is 8 miles. The time it takes Jerry to run this distance is 15 minutes. We need to find the speed Jerry runs in miles per hour. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 minutes = Distance / Speed

We can rearrange the formula to solve for speed:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 8 miles / 0.25 hours

Speed = 32 miles per hour

Answer: 32
