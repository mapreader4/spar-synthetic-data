Let's break it down step by step.

Maria has $500 in her savings. She wants to buy 6 sweaters for $30 each, so the total cost of the sweaters will be 6 x 30 = $180. She also wants to buy 6 scarves for $20 each, so the total cost of the scarves will be 6 x 20 = $120.

The total cost of all the sweaters and scarves will be $180 + $120 = $300. So, Maria will be left with $500 - $300 = $200 in her savings after buying all the sweaters and scarves.

Answer: 200
