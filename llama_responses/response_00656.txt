Let's start by using variables. Let's say the number of books that Zig wrote is x.

We know that Flo wrote four times as many books as Zig. So, if Zig wrote x books, Flo wrote 4x books. We also know that Flo wrote 60 books, so we can set up the equation 4x = 60.

We can solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4. We get that x = 15.

So, the number of books that Zig wrote is 15.

Answer: 15
