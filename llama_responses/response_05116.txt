Let's break it down step by step.

Marge had $12006 initially.

She paid half of the lottery amount for the taxes, so she spent 12006 / 2 = 6000 on taxes.

She put a third of the leftover money towards her student loans. The leftover money is 12006 - 6000 = 6006. She put 6006 / 3 = 2002 towards her student loans.

She put $1000 in savings.

She invested a fifth of that amount in the stock market. A fifth of 1000 is 1000 / 5 = 200.

So, she spent 6000 + 2002 + 1000 + 200 = 8202 on taxes, student loans, savings, and the stock market.

To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: 12006 - 8202 = 198.

Answer: 198
