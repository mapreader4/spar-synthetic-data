Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of cups of dog food in the bag is represented by the variable "c". The dog eats 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening, so the total amount of dog food the dog eats per day is 1 + 1 = 2 cups.

The dog can eat the dog food for c days. The total amount of dog food in the bag is 32 cups, so the number of days it can eat is 32 รท 2 = 16.
