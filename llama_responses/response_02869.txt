Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of pages in the pad, which is 120.

Sammy uses 25% of the pages for his science project. To find 25% of the pages, we can multiply the total number of pages by 0.25.

120 * 0.25 = 30

So, Sammy uses 30 pages for his science project.

Next, Sammy uses another 10 pages for his math homework.

So, the total number of pages used is 30 + 10 = 40.

To find the number of pages remaining, we subtract the total number of pages used from the total number of pages.

120 - 40 = 80

Answer: 80
