Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of picks. We know that half of the picks are red, and one-third of the picks are blue. So, the total number of picks is 1/2 + 1/3, which is 5/3. Since there are 12 blue picks, the total number of picks is 12.

Now, we know that the total number of picks is 12. We also know that one-third of the picks are blue, and one-half of the picks are red. So, the number of yellow picks is 12 - 5/3 - 1/2, which is 1.

Answer: 1
