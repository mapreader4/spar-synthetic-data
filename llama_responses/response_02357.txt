Let's break this problem down into parts. Let's start with the cost of the clown. The clown cost 100 dollars an hour, and the party was 4 hours long, so the clown cost 4 * 100 = 400 dollars. Next, the bounce house was rented for half the time, which is 2 hours. The bounce house cost 3 times as much as the clown, so it cost 3 * 100 = 300. The bounce house cost 300 dollars. The total cost of the clown and the bounce house was 400 + 300 = 700. Finally, everything else for the party cost 1000 dollars. So the total cost of the party was 700 + 1000 = 1800.
