Let's break down Donna's income into the different jobs she did.

1. Dog walking: 2 hours/day * 5 days a week = 10 hours a week * 7 days a week = 70 hours a week
2. Dog walking income: 70 hours * 10.00 per hour = 700.00
3. Card shop job: 2 hours * 12.50 per hour = 25.00
4. Babysitting job: 4 hours * 10.00 per hour = 40.00

Total income: 700.00 + 25.00 + 40.00 = 765.00
