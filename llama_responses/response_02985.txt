Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many burgers Carly needs to cook in total.

Half of the 30 guests want 2 burgers, which is 15 burgers. The other half want 1 burger each, which is 15 burgers. So, Carly needs to cook a total of 15 + 15 = 30 burgers.

Step 2: Determine how many batches Carly needs to cook.

Carly can cook 5 burgers at a time. To find out how many batches she needs, we divide the total number of burgers by 5:

30 burgers รท 5 = 6 batches

Step 3: Determine the total cooking time.

Each burger takes 4 minutes to cook on each side, so Carly needs to cook each burger for a total of 8 minutes. Since she needs to cook 6 batches, the total cooking time is:

6 batches ร 8 minutes per batch = 48 minutes

Answer: 48
