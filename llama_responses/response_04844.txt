Let's break it down step by step.

Brent had 5 Kit-Kat bars, so that is 5 pieces of candy.

He had 3 times that amount in Hershey kisses, which is 3 * 5 = 15 Hershey kisses.

He had 8 boxes of Nerds, which is 8 pieces of candy.

He had 11 lollipops, which is 11 pieces of candy.

He also had 10 Baby Ruths, which is 10 pieces of candy.

He gave his little sister 5 lollipops, so he has 11 - 5 = 6 lollipops left.

Now, let's add up the number of pieces of candy he had:

5 + 15 + 8 + 11 + 10 - 6 = 34

Answer: 34
