Let's break this down step by step:

1. Sydney sends 5 texts to Allison on Monday.
2. Sydney sends 5 texts to Brittney on Monday.
3. Sydney sends 15 texts to Allison on Tuesday.
4. Sydney sends 15 texts to Brittney on Tuesday.

In total, Sydney sent 5 + 5 = 10 texts to Allison and Brittney on Monday, and 15 + 15 = 30 texts to Allison and Brittney on Tuesday. So, in total, Sydney sent 10 + 30 = 40 texts to Allison and Brittney on both days.
