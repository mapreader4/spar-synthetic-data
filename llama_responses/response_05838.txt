Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Mark's pond is 19 feet deep. We know that Mark's pond is 4 feet deeper than 3 times Peter's pond, so we can set up an equation to solve for Peter's pond depth.

Let's use the information that Mark's pond is 4 feet deeper than 3 times Peter's pond, which can be written as:

Mark's pond = 19 = 3 x Peter's pond + 4

We can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get:

Mark's pond - 4 = 3 x Peter's pond

Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get:

Mark's pond / 3 = Peter's pond

Now we can solve for Peter's pond:

Peter's pond = Mark's pond / 3

Peter's pond = 19 / 3

Peter's pond = 6.33
