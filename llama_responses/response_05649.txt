Let's start by identifying the information given to us.

We know that Albert has three times as many marbles as Angela. We can write this as an equation:

Albert's marbles = 3 x Angela's marbles

We also know that Angela has 8 more marbles than Allison, who has 28 marbles. So, we can write this as an equation:

Angela's marbles = Allison's marbles + 8

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Albert's marbles = 3 x (Allison's marbles + 8)

We can simplify the equation by distributing the 3 to both sides:

Albert's marbles = 3 x 28 + 8

We can calculate the multiplication:

Albert's marbles = 84 + 8

Albert's marbles = 92

So, Albert and Allison have 92 marbles in total.

Answer: 92
