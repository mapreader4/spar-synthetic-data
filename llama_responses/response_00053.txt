Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total cost of the ice cream.

10 cartons of ice cream at $4 each is 10 x 4 = 40 dollars.

Let's calculate the total cost of the frozen yoghurt.

4 cartons of frozen yoghurt at $1 each is 4 x 1 = 4 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.

40 dollars on ice cream minus 4 dollars on frozen yoghurt is 36 dollars.

Answer: 36
