Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of birthday presents is x.

The number of Christmas presents is twice the number of birthday presents, so it is 2x.

We know that David found a total of 60 presents, so the equation is:

2x = 60

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, the number of birthday presents is 30.

The number of Christmas presents is twice that, so it is 2(30) = 60.

Answer: 60
