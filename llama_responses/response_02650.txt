Let's start by converting the euros to dollars. Since each euro is worth two dollars, we can multiply the number of euros by 2 to find the total amount in dollars.

Jack has 36 euros, which is 36 x 2 = 72 dollars.

Then, we add the 45 dollars Jack already has to the 72 dollars, so the total amount of money Jack has is 45 + 72 = 117 dollars.

Answer: 117
