Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say x be the number of puppies Dorchester washed.

Dorchester earns $40 per day, so his total earnings will be $40.

Dorchester earned $2.25 for each puppy he washed, so the total amount he earned from washing puppies is 2.25x.

The total amount Dorchester earned is $76. So we can set up the equation as:

40 + 2.25x = 76

To solve for x, we can subtract 40 from both sides:

2.25x = 76 - 40

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

2.25x = 36

Divide both sides by 2.25 to get:

x = 16

So, Dorchester washed 16 puppies that day.
