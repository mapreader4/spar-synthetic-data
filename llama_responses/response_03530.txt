Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Walter earns $5 per hour. He works 5 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:

5 days x $5 per hour = 5 x 5 = $25

2. He allocates 3/4 of his weekly earnings for his schooling. To find out how much he allocates for school, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by 3/4:

$25 x 3/4 = $18.75

So, Walter allocates $18.75 for his schooling.
