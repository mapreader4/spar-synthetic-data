Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, Mary dropped a dozen pounds, which is 12 pounds. So, her weight became 99 - 12 = 87 pounds.

Then, she added back twice the weight that she initially lost, which is 2 x 12 = 24 pounds. So, her weight became 87 + 24 = 111 pounds.

Next, she dropped three times more weight than she initially had lost, which is 3 x 12 = 36 pounds. So, her weight became 111 - 36 = 75 pounds.

Finally, she gained back half of a dozen pounds, which is 6 pounds. So, her final weight became 75 + 6 = 81 pounds.

Answer: 81
