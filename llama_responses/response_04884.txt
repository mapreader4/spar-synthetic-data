Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total adoption fee, which is $200.

The total adoption fee is $200.

Now, James' friend agrees to pay 25% of the total adoption fee. To find 25% of $200, we multiply 25 by $200.

25% of $200 is $50.

James has to pay the remaining amount, which is the difference between the total fee and the amount his friend paid.

$200 - $50 is $150.

So, the answer is: Answer: 150
