Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what Nora has saved. Since Nora has saved five times what Lulu has, and Lulu has saved $6, Nora must have saved 5 x 6 = 30 dollars.

Then, we know that Tamara has saved some amount, but we don't know what that amount is. We can let's say Tamara's savings is x.

The problem says that Nora has saved three times what Tamara has. So, we can write an equation to represent this: 30 = 3x.

Since Nora has saved 30 dollars, and 30 = 3x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get x = 10.

So, Tamara has saved 10 dollars.

Now, the total amount of money the girls have saved is 30 + 10 + 6 = 46 dollars.

To divide this amount equally, we divide 46 by 3: 46 / 3 = 15.33.

Answer: 15.33
