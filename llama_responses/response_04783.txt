Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the recommended daily serving of Vitamin A that Ryan needs to take.

The recommended daily serving of Vitamin A is 200 mg.

Step 2: Determine the number of days in a week.

A week has 7 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total daily serving of Vitamin A Ryan needs to take in a week.

The daily serving is 200 mg, and there are 7 days in a week. So, the total daily serving of Vitamin A Ryan needs to take in a week is:

200 mg x 7 = 1400 mg

Step 4: Determine the number of pills Ryan needs to take to hit the recommended amount.

Each pill has 50 mg of Vitamin A. To find the number of pills Ryan needs to take, we need to divide the total daily serving of Vitamin A by the amount of Vitamin A in each pill.

1400 mg (total daily serving) รท 50 mg (amount of Vitamin A in each pill) = 28 pills

Answer: 28
