Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Sam has 3 German Shepherds.
Step 2: Peter wants to buy 3 times as many German Shepherds as Sam has. So, Peter wants to buy 3 * 3 = 9 German Shepherds.
Step 3: Peter wants 2 times as many French Bulldogs as Sam has. Sam has 4 French Bulldogs, so Peter wants 2 * 4 = 8 French Bulldogs.
Step 4: In total, Peter wants 9 German Shepherds and 8 French Bulldogs. So, the total number of dogs Peter wants is 9 + 8 = 17.
