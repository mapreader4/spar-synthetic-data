Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Michelle gives 4 sandwiches to one of her co-workers. Then, she keeps twice this amount for herself, which is 2 x 4 = 8 sandwiches. So, she gives 4 + 8 = 12 sandwiches to her co-workers. Since she started with 20 sandwiches, she has 20 - 12 = 8 sandwiches left.
