Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of students Beth had at the beginning of her final year.

She had 150 students initially.

Then, 30 more students joined, so she had 150 + 30 = 180 students.

Then, 15 students left, so she had 180 - 15 = 165 students at the end of her final year.

Answer: 165
