Let's break down the information step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the cleaning and the filling. The cost of the cleaning is $70 and the cost of the filling is $120. We know that the cost of the tooth extraction is not given, so we'll call it x.

We know that the dentist bill was five times the cost of a filling, which is $120. So, we can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the dentist bill:

70 + 120 + x = 5 * 120

We can now solve for x:

x = (70 + 120) / 5
x = 190 / 5
x = 38

So, Wendy paid 38 for the tooth extraction.
