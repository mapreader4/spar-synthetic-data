Let's break this down step by step.

1. John was 66 inches tall initially.
2. He had a growth spurt and grew 2 inches per month for 3 months.
3. To find his new height in inches, we need to multiply his initial height by 3 (for the 3 months) and then add the 2 inches he grew each month.
4. 66 * 3 = 198
5. 198 + 6 = 204

Answer: 204
