Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of students that attended the class initially. 45 people attended the class, and then 15 more came in a while later. To find the total number of students, we add 45 and 15 together:

45 + 15 = 60

So, 60 students attended the class. Since the teacher gives one lollipop to every 5 students, we can find the number of lollipops given out by dividing the total number of students by 5:

60 รท 5 = 12

So, the teacher gave away 12 lollipops.
