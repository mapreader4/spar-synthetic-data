Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total length of the ropes Tony has:

* 8-foot rope: 8 feet
* 20-foot rope: 20 feet
* 3 x 2-foot ropes: 3 x 2 = 6 feet
* 7-foot rope: 7 feet

Adding these up, Tony has a total of:
8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41 feet

However, each knot between the ropes makes him lose 1.2 feet, so we need to subtract 1.2 feet for each knot. There are 4 knots (since he has 5 ropes and ties 4 knots between them), so he loses a total of:
4 x 1.2 = 4.8 feet

To find the total length of the rope after tying them all together, we subtract the total lost length from the total length:
41 - 4.8 = 36.2 feet

Answer: 36
