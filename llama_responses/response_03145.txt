Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the sailboat rental: $60. Since Ken rented it for 3 hours a day in 2 days, the total cost for Ken to rent the sailboat is:

60 * 3 * 2 = 360

Now, let's find the cost of the ski boat rental: $80. Since Aldrich rented it for 3 hours a day in 2 days, the total cost for Aldrich to rent the ski boat is:

80 * 3 * 2 = 480

To find the difference in cost between the two, we subtract the cost of the sailboat rental from the cost of the ski boat rental:

480 - 360 = 120

So, the answer is:

Answer: 120
