Let's break down the problem step by step.

Chris wants to buy a video game that costs $60 and an assortment of candy that costs $5. So, the total cost of the items he wants to buy is $60 + $5, which is $65.

Chris will earn $8 per hour for babysitting his little sister. He will work for 9 hours, so he will earn 9 x $8, which is $72.

Chris will have to pay $65 for the video game and candy, and he will earn $72 for his work. So, he will have $72 - $65 left over after making his purchases.

Answer: $7
