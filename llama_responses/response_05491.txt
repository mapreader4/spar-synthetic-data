Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of students in the class: 24.

Since one-third of the students are in the after-school chess program, that is 24 / 3 = 8 students.

Then, half of those students will be absent from school on Friday, which is half of 8, which is 4 students.

To find the total number of students going to the tournament, we add the number of students in the chess program (8) to the number of students absent from school (4).

8 + 4 = 12

Answer: 12
