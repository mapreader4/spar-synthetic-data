Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the distance traveled in normal space. The spacecraft travels 2 billion miles per hour in normal space. If it takes 7 hours to travel in normal space, we can find the distance by multiplying the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 2,000,000,000 * 7
= 14,000,000,000

The spacecraft would travel 14 billion miles in normal space.

Now, when it enters the black hole, it travels three times as fast. So, the speed in the black hole is 2 * 3 = 6,000,000,000 miles per hour. The time it takes to travel through the black hole is 2 hours. So, we can find the distance traveled in the black hole by multiplying the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 6,000,000,000 * 2
= 12,000,000,000

The spacecraft would travel 12 billion miles through the black hole.

Finally, we add the distances traveled in normal space and the black hole together to find the total distance traveled:

Total Distance = Normal Distance + Distance in Black Hole
= 14,000,000,000 + 12,000,000,000
= 26,000,000,000

Answer: 26,000,000,000
