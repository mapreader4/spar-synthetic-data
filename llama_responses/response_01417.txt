Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Mario's age is M. Maria's age is M - 1.

The sum of their ages is 7.

So, M + (M - 1) = 7.

Simplifying the equation, we get M + M - 1 = 7.

Adding M to both sides of the equation, we get 2M = 7 + 1.

Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, we get 2M = 8.

So, Mario's age is 8.
