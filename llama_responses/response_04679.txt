Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of baby sea turtles that got swept away by the wave. Since one-third of the 42 baby sea turtles got swept away, that means that 1/3 * 42 = 14 baby sea turtles got swept away.

To find the number of baby sea turtles that are still on the sand, we need to subtract the number that got swept away from the total number of baby sea turtles. So, we have:

42 (total) - 14 (swept away) = 28

Answer: 28
