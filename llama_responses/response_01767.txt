To find the total number of chives Juvy will plant, we need to subtract the number of parsley and rosemary plants from the total number of plants.

There are 20 rows in total, and 10 plants in each row. The first 3 rows have parsley, which means there are 3 * 10 = 30 parsley plants. The last 2 rows have rosemary, which means there are 2 * 10 = 20 rosemary plants. So, the total number of parsley and rosemary plants is 30 + 20 = 50.

There are 20 rows left, so we subtract 50 from the total number of plants to get the number of chives. 20 - 50 = 10.

Answer: 10
