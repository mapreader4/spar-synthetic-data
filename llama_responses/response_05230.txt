Let's break this down step by step:

1. Tara's initial amount is $90.
2. The account earns 10% interest annually, so after a year, the interest will be 10% of the initial amount, which is 10% of $90, which is $9.
3. After a year, the total amount will be the initial amount plus the interest, which is $90 + $9, which is $99.

Answer: 99
