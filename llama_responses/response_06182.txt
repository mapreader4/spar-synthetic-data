Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: There are 2 round tables with 6 chairs each, so there are 2 x 6 = 12 chairs at the round tables.

Step 2: There are 2 rectangular tables with 7 chairs each, so there are 2 x 7 = 14 chairs at the rectangular tables.

Step 3: To find the total number of chairs, we add the number of chairs from the round tables and the rectangular tables: 12 + 14 = 26.

Answer: 26
