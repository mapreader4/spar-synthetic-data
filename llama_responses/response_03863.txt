To groom 5 dogs and 3 cats, we can find the total time by adding the time it takes to groom each. To groom 5 dogs, it takes 5 x 2.5 hours, which is 12.5 hours. To groom 3 cats, it takes 3 x 0.5 hours, which is 1.5 hours. Then, we add these times together to get the total time: 12.5 + 1.5 = 14 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60: 14 * 60 = 840 minutes.
