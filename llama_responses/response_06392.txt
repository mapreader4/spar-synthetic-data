Let's break down the problem step by step.

The first bill is for $200 and is 2 months overdue, with a 10% interest rate. To calculate the interest, we multiply the principal amount by the interest rate and the number of months overdue:

$200 x 0.10 x 2 = $40

So, the total amount owed on the first bill is:

$200 + $40 = $240

The second bill is for $130 and is 6 months overdue, with a flat late fee of $50 per month. To calculate the total late fee, we multiply the number of months overdue by the late fee:

$50 x 6 = $300

So, the total amount owed on the second bill is:

$130 + $300 = $430

The third bill is for $444 and is 2 months overdue, with a $40 fee the first month overdue and twice that fee the second month overdue. To calculate the total fee, we add the fees for both months:

$40 + (2 x $40) = $120

So, the total amount owed on the third bill is:

$444 + $120 = $564

To find the total amount owed, we add up the amounts owed on all three bills:

$240 + $430 + $564 = $1234

Answer: 1234
