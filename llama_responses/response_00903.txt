To find out how much money Margaux will collect, we need to add up how much each person pays her per day. 

Her friend pays her $5 per day, so in 7 days, she will receive 5 * 7 = 35 dollars. 

Her brother pays her $8 per day, so in 7 days, he will pay her 8 * 7 = 56 dollars. 

Her cousin pays her $4 per day, so in 7 days, he will pay her 4 * 7 = 28 dollars.

To find out how much money Margaux will collect, we add up how much each person pays her per day. 

35 + 56 + 28 = 119. 

So, Margaux will collect 119 dollars.
