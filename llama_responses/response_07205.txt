Let's start by finding the cost of the cars: 5 cars for 20 dollars each will cost 5 x 20 = 100 dollars.

Next, the paint: 5 bottles for 10 dollars each will cost 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.

Finally, the paintbrushes: 5 for 2 dollars each will cost 5 x 2 = 10 dollars.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the cars, the paint, and the paintbrushes: 100 + 50 + 10 = 160 dollars.

Answer: 160
