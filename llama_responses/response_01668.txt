Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the total weight of the rocks is x pounds. Then, the amount of money Jim will make from the sale is 4x.

We know that the total amount of money Jim makes from the sale is 60. So, we can set up an equation:

4x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 60 / 4
x = 15

So, there are 15 pounds of rocks in the bucket.
