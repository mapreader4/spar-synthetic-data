Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of the elliptical machine. The cost of the machine is $120.

Rita made a down payment equal to half the cost of the machine, which is $60.

The store employee offered to waive all layaway fees and taxes if Rita pays the balance within 10 days. The balance is the remaining amount Rita needs to pay, which is the difference between the cost of the machine and the down payment. The balance is $120 - $60 = $60.

To pay the balance within 10 days, Rita needs to pay at least $60 per day. To find the daily minimum amount, we can divide the balance by the number of days. $60 รท 10 = $6.
