Let's break this problem down step by step.

A tiger shark has 180 teeth.

A hammerhead shark has 1/6 the number of teeth of a tiger shark. So, the number of teeth of a hammerhead shark is 180 / 6 = 30.

A great white shark has double the sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark. To find the sum of the teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark, we need to add the number of teeth of the tiger shark (180) and the number of teeth of the hammerhead shark (30). The sum is 180 + 30 = 210.

So, the number of teeth of a great white shark is double the sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark, which is 2 * 210 = 420.

Answer: 420
