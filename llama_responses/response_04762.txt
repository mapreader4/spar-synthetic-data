Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the area of the TVs. The area of the first TV is 48 inches by 100 inches, so the area is 48 * 100 = 4800 square inches. The area of the second TV is 70 inches by 60 inches, so the area is 70 * 60 = 4200 square inches.

Next, we need to multiply the area by the weight per square inch, which is 4 oz. For the first TV, we have 4800 square inches * 4 oz = 19200 oz. For the second TV, we have 4200 square inches * 4 oz = 16800 oz.

Now, we need to convert the weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in 1 pound, so we can divide the total weight by 16 to get the weight in pounds. For the first TV, we have 19200 oz รท 16 = 1200 pounds. For the second TV, we have 16800 oz รท 16 = 1050 pounds.

To find the difference in weight, we subtract the weight of the second TV from the weight of the first TV: 1200 pounds - 1050 pounds = 150 pounds.

Answer: 150
