I will solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: I will calculate the total driving time of Jade. Jade drove for 8 hours each day, so for 3 days, Jade drove for 8 * 3 = 24 hours.

Step 2: I will calculate the total driving time of Krista. Krista drove for 6 hours each day, so for 3 days, Krista drove for 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Step 3: I will add the total driving time of Jade and Krista. 24 hours (Jade) + 18 hours (Krista) = 42 hours.

Answer: 42
