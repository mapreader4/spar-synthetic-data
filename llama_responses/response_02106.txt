Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Felipe took x months to build his house. Since Felipe finished in half the time it took Emilio, we can set up an equation: 2x = 7.5.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: 2x/2 = 7.5/2.

x = 3.75.

So, it took Felipe 3.75 months to build his house.
