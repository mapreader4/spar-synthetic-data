Let's break it down step by step.

Chelsea has 24 kilos of sugar initially.

She divides the sugar into 4 bags equally, so each bag has 24 / 4 = 6 kilos of sugar.

Then, one of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground. Half of 6 kilos of sugar is 3 kilos. So, 24 - 3 = 21 kilos of sugar remain.

Answer: 21
