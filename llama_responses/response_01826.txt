Let's break this problem down step by step.

On Monday, Miriam does 5 push-ups.
On Tuesday, Miriam does 7 push-ups.

Total push-ups on Monday and Tuesday: 5 + 7 = 12

On Wednesday, Miriam does twice as many push-ups as the day before. Since she did 7 push-ups on Tuesday, twice as many would be 2 x 7 = 14.

Total push-ups on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 12 + 14 = 26

On Thursday, Miriam does half the number of total push-ups she already did that week. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Total push-ups on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 26 + 13 = 39

Finally, on Friday, Miriam does as many push-ups as the total number she did over the previous four days. This means she does 39 push-ups on Friday.

Answer: 39
