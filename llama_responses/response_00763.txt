Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used to 6 gifts. We also know that each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon.

To find the total amount of ribbon used by all the gifts, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift uses.

6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards

So, the total amount of ribbon used will be 12 yards.

To find the amount of ribbon left over, we subtract the total amount used from the total amount of ribbon.

18 - 12 = 6

Answer: 6
