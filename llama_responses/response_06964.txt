Let's break this down step by step.

James eats 3 bags of Cheezits, each of which is 2 ounces. That means he ate 3 x 2 = 6 ounces of Cheezits. There are 150 calories in an ounce of Cheezits, so he ate 6 x 150 = 900 calories of Cheezits.

James then goes for a 40-minute run. He burns 12 calories per minute, so he burns 40 x 12 = 480 calories during the run.

James ate 900 calories of Cheezits and burned 480 calories during the run. So, the number of excess calories is 900 - 480 = 420.
