Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Bo has 800 flashcards, and he knows 20% of the words on them.
* 20% of 800 is 160 words.

He has 800 - 160 = 640 words left to learn.
* He has 40 days to learn the rest.
* To find out how many words he needs to learn each day, we can divide 640 by 40.

640 รท 40 = 16

Answer: 16
