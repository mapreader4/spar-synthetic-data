Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. The dietitian ate three-fourths of her lunch, so we know that the amount of food she ate is (3/4) * 40 = 30 calories. The recommended amount of calories by the FDA is 25. The difference between the two is 30 - 25 = 5. Therefore, the dietitian ate 5 more calories than the recommended amount.
