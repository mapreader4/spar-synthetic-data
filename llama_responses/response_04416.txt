Let's break this down step by step.

The cost for a day is $30, so the cost for 11 days is 11 x $30 = $330.

The cost for a week is $190, but the rental is for 11 days, which is more than a week. So, the total cost will be more than $190. Let's calculate the total cost for the extra days: 11 - 7 = 4 days, and 4 days at $30 per day is $120. So, the total cost is $330 + $120 = $450.

Answer: 450.
