Let's call the number of boys signed up to compete "x". Then, we can set up the equation:

Number of girls = Number of kids - Number of boys.

We are given that there are 22 more girls than boys. So, we can write the equation as:

Number of girls = x + 22.

We are asked to find the number of girls. We can subtract the number of boys from both sides of the equation to get the number of girls:

x = Number of girls - 22.

We are given that there are 34 kids in total. So, we can substitute x = 34 - 22 to get the number of girls:

Number of girls = 34 - 22 = 12.

Answer: 12
