Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total number of hours they worked.

On the first day, they worked 10 hours.
On the second day, they worked 8 hours.
On the third day, they worked 15 hours.

The total number of hours worked is 10 + 8 + 15 = 33 hours.

Now, Mr. Fletcher paid each of them $10 per hour. So, we need to multiply the total number of hours by the hourly wage.

33 hours * $10 per hour = 33 * 10 = $330.

So, the total amount of money they received altogether is $330.
