Let's break this down step by step.

1. We know that 5 euros is worth 1 dollar. So, 1 euro is worth 1/5 of a dollar.
2. We know that Willie has 70 euros, which is the total amount of money Willie has.
3. The money exchange rate is 5/7ths of the official rate. So, the money exchange rate is 5/7.
4. To find out how many dollars Willie gets, we need to multiply the total amount of money Willie has (70 euros) by the money exchange rate (5/7).

So, 70 euros * 5/7 = 50/7 = 7.14 dollars.

Answer: 7.14
