Let's break this problem down step by step.

Jesse received $50 as a gift.

She bought a novel that cost her $7.

So, she spent $7.

Then, she went to lunch and spent twice as much as the novel cost her. The novel cost her $7, so twice that amount would be 2 x $7 = $14.

So, Jesse spent $14 on lunch.

To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the total amount she spent ($7 + $14 = $21) from the initial amount she had ($50).

$50 - $21 = $29

Answer: 29
