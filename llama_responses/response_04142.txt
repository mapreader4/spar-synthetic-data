Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The middle building is 100 feet tall.
2. The building on the left is 80% of the height of the middle one, which is 0.8 x 100 = 80 feet.
3. The building on the right is 20 feet shorter than if the building on the left and middle were stacked on top of each other. Let's find the height of the left and middle stacked together. The left building is 80 feet, and the middle building is 100 feet, so together they would be 80 + 100 = 180 feet. The building on the right is 180 - 20 = 160 feet tall.
4. To find the total height, we add the heights of all three buildings: 80 + 100 + 160 = 340 feet.

Answer: 340
