Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Veronica's flashlight can be seen at night from a distance of 1000 feet. This means that Freddie's flashlight can be seen at night from a distance 3 times farther than Veronica's, which is:

1000 x 3 = 3000 feet

So Freddie's flashlight can be seen at night from a distance of 3000 feet.

Next, we know that Velma's flashlight can be seen at night from a distance 2000 feet less than 5 times farther than Freddie's flashlight. To find this distance, we need to multiply Freddie's distance by 5 and then subtract 2000:

3000 x 5 = 15000
15000 - 2000 = 13000

So Velma's flashlight can be seen at night from a distance of 13000 feet.

Finally, we need to find the difference in distance between Velma's and Veronica's flashlights. This is simply the difference between Velma's distance and Veronica's distance:

13000 - 1000 = 12000

Answer: 12000
