Let's break it down step by step:

Kwame studied for 2.5 hours. Connor studied for 1.5 hours. Lexia studied for 97 minutes.

First, let's convert the hours into minutes for Kwame and Connor:

Kwame: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 150 minutes
Connor: 1.5 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 90 minutes

Now, let's find the total minutes studied by Kwame and Connor:

Kwame: 150 minutes
Connor: 90 minutes

Now, let's find the difference in minutes:

150 minutes - 90 minutes = 60 minutes

So, Kwame and Connor studied 60 minutes more than Lexia.
