Let's start by first finding the total number of pounds of wool produced. Since each sheep produces 10 pounds of wool, the total pounds of wool is 200 x 10 = 2000 pounds. 

Next, we need to find the revenue from the sale of the wool. She sold each pound of wool for $20. So, the total revenue from the sale of the wool is 2000 x 20 = 40000. 

Now, to find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the job from the revenue. The cost of the job was $2000. So, the profit is 40000 - 2000 = 38000. 

Answer: 38000
