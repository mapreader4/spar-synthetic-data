Let's break down the information given to us.

Casey takes 6 hours to complete a marathon race. This means that the time taken by Casey to complete the race is 6 hours.

Zendaya takes 1/3 times longer than Casey to cover the same distance. This means that the time taken by Zendaya to complete the race is 6 * 1/3 = 2 hours.

To find the average time the two take to complete the race, we need to find the average of the two times: (6 + 2) / 2 = 4 hours.
