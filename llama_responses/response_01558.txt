Let's break down the information given. Janet works 40 hours a week, which is 160 hours a month. As a freelancer, she would get paid $40/hour, so she would make:

$40/hour * 160 hours/month = $6400/month

However, she would have to pay $25 a week in FICA taxes and $400/month in healthcare premiums. So, she would be left with:

$6400 - $25/week * 4 = $100 - $400 = $5000

So, Janet would make $5000 a month as a freelancer.
