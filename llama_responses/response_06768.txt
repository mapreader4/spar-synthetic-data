Let us start by letting x be the length of Kate's hair. Since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair, we know that x = (1/2) * Emily's hair length. Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair, so Logan's hair is 20 - 6 = 14 inches. So, we know that Emily's hair is 14 + x, so x = 14 + 2 = 16. Kate's hair is 16 inches.
