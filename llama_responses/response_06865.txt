Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start with the smoothies. Scott sold 40 cups of smoothies at $3 each, so the total amount of money made from smoothies is 40 * 3 = 120.

Next, Scott sold 18 cakes at $2 each. The total amount of money made from cakes is 18 * 2 = 36.

Now, let's add the amount of money made from smoothies and cakes together. 120 + 36 = 156.

Answer: 156
