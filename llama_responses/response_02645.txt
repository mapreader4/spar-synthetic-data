Let's break down the services Rebecca will provide:

* Haircuts: 4 x $30 = $120
* Perm: 1 x $40 = $40
* Dye jobs: 2 x ($60 - $10) = 2 x $50 = $100
* Total revenue from services: $120 + $40 + $100 = $260
* Tips: $50
* Total revenue: $260 + $50 = $310

Rebecca will have $310 in total revenue at the end of the day.

Answer: 310
