Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Chad has 5 nights to enjoy his crackers. 
2. Each night, he has 5 crackers. 
3. A box of crackers has 4 sleeves, each holding 28 crackers. 
4. So, 5 nights * 5 crackers per night = 25 crackers per night.
5. 25 crackers per night * 5 nights = 125 crackers in total.
6. A box of crackers has 4 sleeves, each holding 28 crackers. 
7. 4 sleeves * 28 crackers = 112 crackers per box.
8. 5 boxes of crackers = 5 * 112 crackers = 560 crackers.
9. So, 560 crackers will last Chad for 560 / 5 nights = 112 crackers per night.

Answer: 112
