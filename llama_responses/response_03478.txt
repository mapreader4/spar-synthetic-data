Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of S'mores that 8 people will eat. There are 8 people, and each person will eat 3 S'mores. So, the total number of S'mores is:

8 x 3 = 24

So, 24 S'mores will be eaten.

Step 2: Find the cost of supplies for 4 S'mores. It costs $3 to make 4 S'mores, so the cost of supplies for 1 S'mores is:

$3 รท 4 = $0.75

Step 3: Since we need to find the cost of supplies for 24 S'mores, we need to multiply the cost of supplies for 1 S'mores by the number of S'mores. So, the total cost is:

24 x $0.75 = $18

Answer: 18
