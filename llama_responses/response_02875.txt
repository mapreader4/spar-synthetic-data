Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the distance from Dawn's house to Mary's house is x miles. Since Ken's house is twice as far from Dawn's house as Mary's house, Ken's house is 2x miles away from Dawn's house.

Since Ken's house is 4 miles away from Dawn's house, we can set up an equation: 2x = 4.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us x = 2.

So, the distance from Dawn's house to Mary's house is 2 miles.

Now, let's find the distance Ken will cover if he goes from his house to Dawn's house, then to Mary's, then back to his own house.

First, Ken goes from his house to Dawn's house, which is 4 miles. Then, he goes from Dawn's house to Mary's house, which is 2 miles. Then, he goes back to his own house, which is 4 miles again. So, the total distance Ken will cover is 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 miles.
