Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of hours Latia needs to work in a month.

Latia earns $10 per hour and works for 30 hours a week. So, in a month, she works for 4 weeks, which is 4 * 30 = 120 hours. So, her total earnings are 4 * 10 = $400.

Step 2: Determine how many more hours Latia needs to work to earn the cost of the TV.

The cost of the TV is $1700. She needs to earn $1700 - $400 = $1300 more.

Step 3: Calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn the additional amount.

$1300 / $10 = 130 hours.

Answer: 130.
