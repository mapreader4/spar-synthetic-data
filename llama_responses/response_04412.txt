Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of pieces each son gets:

Reyn gets 25 pieces, and Rhys gets twice as much as Reyn, so Rhys gets 25 * 2 = 50 pieces. Rory gets three times as much as Reyn, so Rory gets 25 * 3 = 75 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces given to the three boys, we add the number of pieces each boy gets: 25 + 50 + 75 = 150.

The total number of pieces given is 150.

To find the number of pieces left to be placed, we subtract the total number of pieces given from the total number of pieces in the puzzle: 300 - 150 = 150.

Answer: 150
