To solve this problem, I will first calculate the total number of apples Jack has after giving 10 to his father.

Jack has 55 apples initially. After giving 10 to his father, he will have 55 - 10 = 45 apples left.

Now, Jack wants to share the remaining apples equally among his 4 friends. To do this, I will divide 45 by 4.

45 รท 4 = 11.25

So, each of his 4 friends will get 11.25 apples.
