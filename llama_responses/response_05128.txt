Let's break this down step by step.

1. James pays $1000 for advertising.
2. 100 customers came to his site.
3. 80% of those customers bought something at the store.
4. The cost of each item is $25.

To find the total revenue from the store, we multiply the number of customers who bought something (80) by the cost of each item ($25):

80 * 25 = 2000

5. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the advertising ($1000) from the total revenue:

2000 - 1000 = 1000

Answer: 1000
