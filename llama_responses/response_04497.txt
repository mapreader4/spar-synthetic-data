Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cans needed to feed 40 people.

For 40 people, the number of cans needed would be 600.

Now, let's find the number of cans needed to feed 30% fewer people.

To find the number of cans needed for 30% fewer people, we need to multiply the number of cans needed for 40 people by the decimal 0.7.

So, the number of cans needed for 30% fewer people is 40 * 0.7 = 28.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 28
