Let's break it down step by step.

There are 20% of the 500 clovers that have four leaves. 20% of 500 is 100. So, 100 of the clovers have four leaves.

Now, one quarter of these 100 clovers are purple. So, 1/4 of 100 is 25. So, 25 of these 100 clovers are purple.

So, the number of purple clovers that have four leaves is 25.

Answer: 25
