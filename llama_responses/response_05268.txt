Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Pat's Pool Supply has the same number of swimming pools as Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store. This is stated in the sentence "Pat's Pool Supply has three times as many swimming pools as Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store."

Let's say the number of pools at Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store is x. Then, since Pat's Pool Supply has the same number of pools, the number of pools at Pat's Pool Supply would also be x.

The problem asks us to find the total number of pools. Since the problem states that Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store has 200 pools, we can set up an equation to represent this information.

Let's let's say x is the number of pools at Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store. Then, we know that Pat's Pool Supply has three times this number, so we can set up the equation as 3x = 200.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get x by 200 / 3.
