Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of customers who bought watermelons. We know that 17 customers bought 1 melon, and 3 customers bought 3 melons. We also know that the rest of the customers bought 2 melons.

We can set up an equation to represent the number of customers who bought watermelons. Let's say the number of customers who bought watermelons is x.

We can set up the equation as follows:

17 + 3 + 2 = x

We know that 17 + 3 = 20. Therefore, x = 20.

Answer: 20
