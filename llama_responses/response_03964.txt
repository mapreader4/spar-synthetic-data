Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: The conference center has six rooms. Each room can hold up to 80 people.

Step 2: The conference center is 2/3 full. This means that 2/3 of the total number of rooms are already occupied.

Step 3: To find the total number of people in the conference center, we need to multiply the number of rooms by the capacity of each room.

Step 4: The total capacity of the conference center is 6 rooms * 80 people per room = 480 people.

Step 5: The conference center is 2/3 full, so 2/3 of the total capacity is already occupied. To find the number of people in the conference center, we need to multiply the total capacity by 2/3.

Answer: 480 * 2/3 = 320.
