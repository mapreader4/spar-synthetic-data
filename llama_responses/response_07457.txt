Let's start by identifying the given information:

Mark deposited $88.
Bryan deposited $40 less than five times as much as Mark.
We know that Bryan deposited $40, so we can write an equation: 40 = 5x - 88.
We can solve for x by subtracting 88 from both sides of the equation: 40 = 5x - 88.
40 - 88 = 12.
x = 12.

Answer: 12
