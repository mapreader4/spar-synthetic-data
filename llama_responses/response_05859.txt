Let's start by finding the total amount of sugar in the chocolate bars. Michelle bought 14 chocolate bars, each of which had 10 grams of sugar. So, the total amount of sugar in the chocolate bars is 14 x 10 = 140 grams.

Next, let's find the amount of sugar in the lollipop. It had 37 grams of sugar, plus 190 calories. The calories are not sugar, so we only need to count the sugar. The total amount of sugar in the lollipop is 37 grams.

Now, let's add the amount of sugar from the chocolate bars to the amount of sugar in the lollipop. 140 grams + 37 grams = 177 grams.

Answer: 177
