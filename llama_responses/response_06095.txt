Let the ages of Beau's sons be denoted by x.  Since they are triplets, we know that they are all 16 years old today.  Three years ago, their ages were x - 3.  We can write the equation for their ages three years ago as 3x = x - 3.  The sum of their ages three years ago was equal to Beau's age, so we can write the equation as x - 3 = Beau.  We can solve for Beau's current age by adding 3 to both sides of the equation and then dividing by 3: (x - 3) + 3 = Beau + 3/3 = Beau + 1.  We can solve for Beau's current age as Beau + 1 = 19.  So Beau is 19 years old today.
