Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with what we know. Billy is 3 years younger than Gladys, and Gladys is 30 years old. So, Billy is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Now, the problem tells us that the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas is equal to the age of Gladys. So, the sum of their ages is 30. Since Billy is 27 years old, Lucas must be 30 - 27 = 3 years old.

So, three years from now, Lucas will be 3 + 3 = 6 years old. 

Answer: 6
