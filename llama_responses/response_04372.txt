Let's think step by step.

Cory has $20.00 and she wants to buy two packs of candies that cost $49.00 each. To find out how much money Cory has left after buying the packs of candies, we need to subtract the cost of the packs of candies from the initial amount of money Cory has.

Let's subtract 2 times the cost of one pack of candies (49.00) from the initial amount of money Cory has (20.00).

20.00 - 2 x 49.00 = 20.00 - 98.00 = 22.00

So, Cory has 22.00 left after buying the packs of candies.
