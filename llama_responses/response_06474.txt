Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue of each company:

Company A sells 300 big bottles for $4 each, so the total revenue is:
300 x $4 = $1200

Company B sells 350 big bottles for $3.5 each, so the total revenue is:
350 x $3.5 = $1225

Step 2: Subtract the total revenue of Company B from the total revenue of Company A:
$1225 (Company B) - $1200 (Company A) = $25

Answer: 25
