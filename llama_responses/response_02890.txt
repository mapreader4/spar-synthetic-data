Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Kyle has 12 less than 3 times what Dave has. So, if we let x be the amount Dave has, then we know that 3x - 12 = 0. We can solve for x by adding 12 to both sides of the equation and then dividing by 3.

3x - 12 + 12 = 3x = 0 + 12
3x = 12

x = 4

So, Dave has 4. Now, we know that Kyle has 12 less than 3 times what Dave has. So, Kyle has 4 * 3 = 12 - 12. 12 - 12 = 0. Kyle has 12 - 12 = 0.

Answer: 0
