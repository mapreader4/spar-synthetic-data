Let's break it down step by step:

1. The full price of the shoes is $85.
2. Officers who have served at least a year get a 20% discount on the full price, which is 0.2 * 85 = 17.
3. Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. So, for officers who have served at least three years, the discount is 1.25 * 17 = 21.
4. To get the final price, we add the two discounts together. 21 - 17 = 4.

Answer: 4
