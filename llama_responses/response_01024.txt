Let's break this problem down step by step.

Rafael works 10 hours on Monday, which means he works 10 x 20 = 200 dollars on Monday. He works 8 hours on Tuesday, which means he works 8 x 20 = 160 dollars on Tuesday. 

In total, he works 200 + 160 = 360 dollars in 2 days. Since he has 20 hours left to work, he has 20 x 20 = 400 hours left to work in total. 

Since he is paid $20 per hour, he will make 400 x 20 = 8000 dollars.
