Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the plant is currently 20 feet tall. We are told that it will be 80 feet tall after a year. To find the monthly growth rate, we need to find the difference between the final height and the initial height.

The difference between 80 feet and 20 feet is 60 feet. To find the monthly growth rate, we can divide this difference by the number of months in a year, which is 12.

So, the monthly growth rate is 60 feet / 12 = 5 feet.
