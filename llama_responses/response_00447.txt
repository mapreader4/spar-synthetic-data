Let's break this down step by step.

1. Megan has read 32 books.  Kelcie has read 1/4 of the amount of books that Megan has read. 1/4 of 32 is 8, so Kelcie has read 8 books.

2. Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read. 2 times 8 is 16, so Greg has read 16 books.

3. To find the total number of books that Megan, Kelcie, and Greg have read, we add the number of books each of them have read: 32 + 8 + 16 = 56.

Answer: 56
