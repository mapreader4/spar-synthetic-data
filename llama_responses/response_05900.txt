Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Alvin has x coconut trees.

Let's say Alvin needs $90 to buy something. He wants to know how many coconut trees he needs to harvest to get $90.

We know that 1 coconut can be sold for $3. So, to get $90, Alvin needs 30 coconuts.

We know that each coconut tree yields 5 coconuts. So, to get 30 coconuts, Alvin needs to harvest 6 coconut trees.
