Let's break this problem down step by step.

Annie had a pack of 21 crayons and a box of 36 crayons in her locker, so she had a total of 21 + 36 = 57 crayons.

Her friend Bobby gave her half of what she already had in her locker, which is 36 crayons. So, Annie now has 36 + 36 = 72 crayons.

She then decided to give her sister Mary 1/3 of her total amount of crayons, which is 72 crayons. To find 1/3 of 72, we can divide 72 by 3, which is 24.

So, Annie gives her sister Mary 24 crayons.

Answer: 24
