Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the cost of the potatoes is x.

Mrs. Thompson paid a total of $15 for 3 chickens and the potatoes. So, the cost of the potatoes is the difference between the total amount she paid and the cost of the chickens.

The cost of the chickens is 3 * 3 = $9. So, the cost of the potatoes is $15 - $9 = $6.
