To find the total cost of the items Josh bought, we need to multiply the cost of each item by the number of items of that item. The cost of films is 9 x 5 = 45. The cost of books is 4 x 4 = 16. The cost of CDs is 6 x 3 = 18. To find the total cost, we add the costs together: 45 + 16 + 18 = 79. The answer is: Answer: 79
