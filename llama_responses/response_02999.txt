Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of marbles in each color.

* White: 50
* Yellow: 12
* Red:? (unknown)

We know that half of the total marbles are white, which is 50 / 2 = 25.
We also know that 12 are yellow, and there are 50% fewer green marbles than yellow marbles. Let's find the number of green marbles. Let's call the number of green marbles x.

The number of green marbles is 50 - 12 = 38.

So, the total number of green marbles is 38, and there are 50 - 38 = 12 red marbles.

Answer: 12
