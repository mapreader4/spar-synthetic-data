Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of carrots Harris can buy in a year. There are 365 days in a year, and he feeds his dog 1 large carrot per day. So, in a year, Harris can buy:

1 carrot/day * 365 days = 365 carrots

Now, we need to find the cost of the carrots. Each bag has 5 carrots, and each bag costs $2.00. So, the cost of a bag is:

5 carrots * $2.00 = $10.00

Since Harris buys 1 carrot per day, the number of bags he can buy in a year is:

365 carrots / 5 carrots per bag = 73 bags

The total cost of the carrots in a year is:

73 bags * $10.00 per bag = $730.00

So, the answer is: Answer: $730.00
