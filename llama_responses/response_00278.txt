To find the price of the house, I will first calculate the total square footage of the house. The house is 2,400 sq ft and the barn is 1,000 sq ft. So, the total square footage is 2,400 + 1,000 = 3,400 sq ft. Then, I will multiply the total square footage by the price per square foot to get the total price. The price per square foot is $98. So, the total price is 3,400 * 98 = 332,800.
