To find the area of the central area, we need to multiply the length and width of the area. The area of the central area is 10 feet by 10 feet, so we multiply 10 x 10 = 100 square feet.

To find the area of the hallway, we need to multiply the length and width of the hallway. The length is 6 feet and the width is 4 feet, so we multiply 6 x 4 = 24 square feet.

To find the total area of the hardwood flooring, we add the area of the central area and the area of the hallway. 100 + 24 = 124 square feet.
