Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

1. The craftsman makes 16 jars.
2. Each jar has 5 marbles.
3. Each clay pot has three times as many marbles as the jar. So, each clay pot has 15 marbles.

Now, let's figure out how many marbles there are in total.

1. There are 16 jars, and each jar has 15 marbles.
2. To find the total number of marbles, we multiply the number of jars by the number of marbles per jar.

16 * 15 = 240

So, the answer is 240.

Answer: 240
