Let's say Quinn caught x frogs.  Then, Alster caught twice the amount of frogs, so he caught 2x.  Bret caught 3x the amount of frogs as Quinn, so he caught 3x.  Since x + 2x = 2x, we know that x = 1.  So, 3x = 3.  Since Bret caught 3x frogs, he caught 3(1) = 3 frogs.  So, the answer is:

Answer: 3
