Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Sara's height is x. Then, Joe's height is 2x, since Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height.

We know that Sara and Joe have a combined height of 120 inches, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x = 120

We can solve this equation by adding 2 to both sides:

x + 2x = 120

Subtracting x from both sides by x:

2x = 120 - x

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 60

So, Sara's height is 60 inches, and Joe's height is 2 * 60 = 120 inches. Therefore, Joe is 120 inches.

Answer: 120
