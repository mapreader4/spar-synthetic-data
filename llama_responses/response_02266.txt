Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with Haley. Haley has 25 necklaces. 

Let's now consider Josh. Josh has half the number of necklaces as Haley, which is 25 / 2 = 12.

To find how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, we need to subtract the number of necklaces Josh has from the number of necklaces Haley has. 

25 - 12 = 13.

Answer: 13
