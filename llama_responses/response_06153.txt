Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost for the first 5 books. The cost of the first 5 books is 5 x $20 = $100.

For each book after the first 5 books, Beatrice receives a $2 discount. So, the cost for each additional book is $20 - $2 = $18.

The total cost for the 6th to 20th book is 15 books x $18 = 15 x $18 = $270.

The total cost is the cost of the first 5 books, plus the cost of the 6th to 20th book. So, the total cost is $100 + $270 = $370.

Answer: 370
