Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. The distance between Arizona and New York is 2,000 miles when flying.
2. The distance increases by 40% if someone decides to drive instead of flying.
3. Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York.

To find the distance between Missouri and New York when driving, we need to increase the original distance by 40%. To do this, we can multiply the original distance by 1.4 (since 40% is the same as 40/100, or 0.4, and multiplying by 1.4 is the same as adding 40%).

2,000 miles * 1.4 = 2,800 miles

So, the distance between Missouri and New York when driving is 2,800 miles.

Answer: 2800
