Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of markers used by the first two groups. The first group has 10 students who take 2 markers each, so they use a total of 10 x 2 = 20 markers. The second group has 15 students who take 4 markers each, so they use a total of 15 x 4 = 60 markers. The total number of markers used by the first two groups is 20 + 60 = 80 markers.

Next, we need to find the number of markers remaining in the 22 boxes. Each box contains 5 markers, so the total number of markers is 22 x 5 = 110 markers. Since the first two groups used 80 markers, the number of markers remaining is 110 - 80 = 30 markers.

The last group has 5 students (since there are 30 students in total and 10 + 15 = 25 students in the first two groups). The remaining markers are divided equally among these 5 students. To find the number of markers each student receives, we can divide the remaining markers (30) by the number of students (5). This gives us 30 รท 5 = 6 markers per student.
