Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information: 24 marbles in total, 6 red marbles, and the rest are orange marbles. We can represent this information using a simple equation:

Total marbles = Blue marbles + Red marbles + Orange marbles

We know that the total number of marbles is 24. Since half of the marbles are blue, the number of blue marbles is:

Blue marbles = 24 / 2 = 12

The number of red marbles is given as 6, so we can subtract this from the total number of marbles to find the number of orange marbles:

Orange marbles = 24 - 12 - 6 = 8

Answer: 8
