Let's think step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. Hannah has 5 times as many dolls as her sister. This means that Hannah has 5 x 8 dolls, because her sister has 8 dolls.

To find the total number of dolls Hannah and her sister have, we can multiply 5 by 8. 5 x 8 = 40.

So, Hannah and her sister have 40 dolls.

Answer: 40
