Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let Hania's current age be x.
2. Since Samir turned half of Hania's age 10 years ago, we know that Samir's age 10 years ago was also half of x.
3. So, Samir's age 10 years ago is 0.5x.
4. Since Hania's age 10 years ago was 10, we know that 0.5x = 10.
5. Therefore, x = 20.
6. Now, we know Samir's current age is 20.
7. In five years, Hania will be 45 years old.
8. In 5 years, Samir will be 25 years old.
9. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: 25.
