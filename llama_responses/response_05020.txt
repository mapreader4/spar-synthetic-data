Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Alice is going to earn from the sales. She will earn a basic salary of $240 and a 2% commission from the sales. So, we can calculate the commission as follows:

Commission = 2% of $2500 = 0.02 x $2500 = $50

So, her total earnings will be:

Total earnings = $240 + $50 = $290

Next, we need to find out how much she will save. She saves 10% of her total earnings. So, we can calculate the amount she will save as follows:

Amount saved = 10% of $290 = 0.1 x $290 = $29

So, Alice will save $29 this month.

Answer: 29
