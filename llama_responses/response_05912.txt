Let's break down the cost of each item:

* Selene buys 3 sandwiches at $2 each, so she spends 3 x 2 = 6 dollars.
* Selene also buys 1 can of fruit juice at $2, so she spends 1 x 2 = 2 dollars.
* Tanya buys 2 hamburgers at $2 each, so she spends 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.
* Tanya buys 2 cans of fruit juice at $2 each, so she spends 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.

So, the total amount spent by Selene is 6 + 2 = 8 dollars, and the total amount spent by Tanya is 4 + 4 = 8 dollars.

The total amount spent by both Selene and Tanya together is 8 + 8 = 16 dollars.
