Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's let the number of boys be x.

The difference between the number of boys and girls is 400, so the number of girls is x + 400.

The total number of boys and girls is 600, so the total number of boys and girls is x + 400 + x.

The question asks for 60% of the total number of boys and girls. Since 60% is the same as 0.6, we can multiply the total number of boys and girls by 0.6 to get 0.6 * (x + 400 + x).

The problem says the number of girls is more than the number of boys. This means that the number of girls is x + 400 + x > x.

We can subtract x from both sides of the inequality to get 400 > 0. So, 0.4x > 0.

We can divide both sides of the inequality by 0.4 to get x > 1000.

So, the number of boys is 1000.

Answer: 1000
