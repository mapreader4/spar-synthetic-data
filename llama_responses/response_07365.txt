Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start with the information that Frank and Bill have $42.

They bought 3 pizzas that cost $11 each, so the total cost of the pizzas is $33. Frank paid for all 3 pizzas, so he gave Bill the remaining amount of money.

Since Frank paid for the pizzas, he gave Bill the rest of his money. So, the amount of money that Bill got from Frank is 42 - 33 = 9.

Bill already had $30, so he now has 30 + 9 = 39.
