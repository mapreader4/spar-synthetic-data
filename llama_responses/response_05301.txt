Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by letting the number of lines for the first character be x.

The second character has eight more lines than the first character, so the number of lines for the second character is x + 8.

The third character has two lines, so the number of lines for the third character is 2.

The second character has six more than three times the number of lines the third character has, so we can set up the equation 2x + 8 = 6 + 3 * 2. We can simplify this equation to get 2x + 8 = 6 + 6, and then solve for x. Subtract 8 from both sides to get 2x = -2. Multiply both sides by 1/2 to get x = -1.

The first character has 1 more line than the second character, so the number of lines for the first character is -1 + 8 = 7. Therefore, the first character has 7 lines.
