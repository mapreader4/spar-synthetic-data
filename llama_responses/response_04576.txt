Let's break this problem down step by step.

Carter goes through 5 sets of drum sticks per show. He does this for 30 nights, so he does it 30 times.

To find the total number of sets of drum sticks, we multiply the number of sets per show by the number of shows:

5 sets per show * 30 shows = 150 sets

So, the answer is:

Answer: 150
