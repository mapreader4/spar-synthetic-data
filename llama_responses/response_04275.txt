Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Scott, Mary, and Ken have committed to raising $4,000 for the children's hospital. Mary's collection is five times Ken's, and Ken has $600. We can represent this information in an equation:

M = 5K, where M is Mary's collection and K is Ken's funds.

We know that M = 5K, so we can write an equation:

M = 5K = 600

To solve for K, we need to get K by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

K = 600 / 5
K = 120

So, Ken has $120. Now, to find out by how much the three have exceeded their goal, we can subtract 120 from 4000:

4000 - 120 = 3880

The three of them have exceeded their goal by 3800.
