George picks 45 oranges and 5 more apples than Amelia. So George picks 50 apples. Amelia picks 18 fewer oranges than George and 15 apples. So, George picks 45 + 15 = 60 apples. Amelia picks 45 - 18 = 27 oranges. So, George picks 60 apples and Amelia picks 27 oranges. In total, they pick 60 + 27 = 87 fruits. Answer: 87
