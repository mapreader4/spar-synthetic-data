Let's break this down step by step.

Turner wants to ride the rollercoaster 3 times. The cost of 1 ride on the rollercoaster is 4 tickets. So the total cost for the rollercoaster is 3 x 4 = 12 tickets.

Turner wants to ride the Catapult 2 times. The cost of 1 ride on the Catapult is 4 tickets. So the total cost for the Catapult is 2 x 4 = 8 tickets.

Turner wants to ride the Ferris wheel once. The cost of 1 ride on the Ferris wheel is 1 ticket. So the total cost for the Ferris wheel is 1 x 1 = 1 ticket.

The total number of tickets Turner needs is 12 + 8 + 1 = 21. Answer: 21
