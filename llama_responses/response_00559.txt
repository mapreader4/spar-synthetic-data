Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Luna's monthly food budget is 60% of her house rental budget.
* Luna's phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget.
* The total budget of house rental and food budget is $240.

Let's first find Luna's house rental budget. We can do this by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's say her house rental budget is x.

The equation will be: 0.6x = 0.1x + 0.4x = 240

Now, let's solve for x.

0.6x + 0.4x = 240

Subtract 0.4x from both sides of the equation to get:

0.6x = 240 - 0.4x

0.2x = 240

Divide both sides by 0.2 to get:

x = 240 / 0.2

x = 1200

So Luna's house rental budget is 1200.

Now, we can find her phone bill budget. We know that it is 10% of her food budget. Let's find Luna's food budget. We can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's say her food budget is y.

The equation will be: 0.1y = 0.6x

Now, we can solve for y.

0.1y = 0.6x

0.9y = 0.6x

Now, we can substitute y with 1200, which is Luna's house rental budget.

0.9y = 0.6(1200)

0.9y = 720

So, Luna's phone bill budget is 720.

Now, we can find her total monthly budget to pay all those expenses. We can add her house rental budget and phone bill budget together.

Luna's total monthly budget is: 1200 + 720
