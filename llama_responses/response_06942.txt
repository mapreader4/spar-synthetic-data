Let's start by finding the number of legs of the kangaroos. Since kangaroos have 2 legs each, and Mark has 23 kangaroos, the total number of legs of the kangaroos would be:

2 x 23 = 46

Now, Mark has three times as many goats as kangaroos, so the number of goats would be 3 x 23 = 69.

The total number of legs of all his animals is the sum of the legs of kangaroos and goats, which is 46 + 69 = 115.

Answer: 115
