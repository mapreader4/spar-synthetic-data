Let's break it down step by step.

Let's let Jayden's current age be x.

Ernesto is 11 years old, so in 3 years, he will be 14 years old.

Since Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age, we can set up an equation:

x + 3 = 14 / 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = (14 / 2)

x = 7

So, Jayden is 7 years old.
