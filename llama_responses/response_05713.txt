Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by letting t be the time it takes Tony to run a mile. Since Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina, that means that Tina's time to run a mile is 2t. And since Tom is one-third the speed of Tina, Tom's time to run a mile is 3t.

We can write an equation to represent the time it takes for all three of them to run a mile: t + 2t + 3t = 6t.

Since we know that the total time is 6t, we can solve for t by dividing both sides by 6:

t + 2t + 3t = 6t

t = 6

So, Tony's time to run a mile is 6, Tina's time to run a mile is 12, and Tom's time to run a mile is 18.

Answer: 6 + 12 + 18 = 36
