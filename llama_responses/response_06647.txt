Let's break it down step by step.

Yesterday, Sarah collected 50 cans. Lara collected 30 more cans than Sarah, so Lara collected 50 + 30 = 80 cans yesterday.

Today, Sarah collected 40 cans and Lara collected 70 cans. To find the difference between the number of cans collected today, we can subtract the number of cans collected yesterday from the number of cans collected today.

Sarah collected 70 - 40 = 30 cans today.

Answer: 30
