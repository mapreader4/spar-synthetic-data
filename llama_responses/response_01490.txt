Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total weight of the fruits Tommy ordered. We know that he ordered 3 kilograms of apples, 1 kilogram of orange, and 3 kilograms of grapes. 

The total weight of the fruits is the sum of the weights of the individual fruits. So, we can add the weights of the fruits:

3 kilograms of apples + 1 kilogram of orange + 3 kilograms of grapes =?

To find the total weight of the fruits, we add the weights together:

3 + 1 + 3 = 7

So, Tommy ordered 7 kilograms of fruits in total.
