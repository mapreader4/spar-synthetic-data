Let's break it down step by step.

Tory started with 50 packs of cookies. He sold 12 packs to his grandmother. So, he has 50 - 12 = 38 packs left.

Then, he sold 7 packs to his uncle, so he has 38 - 7 = 31 packs left.

Finally, he sold 5 packs to a neighbor, so he has 31 - 5 = 26 packs left.

Tory needs to sell 26 more packs of cookies to reach his goal of selling all 50 packs.
