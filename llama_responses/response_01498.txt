Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to calculate Kristy's total monthly earnings. She earns a basic salary of $7.50 per hour, and she worked for 160 hours. So, her basic salary is:

$7.50 per hour x 160 hours = $1200

She also earns a 16% commission on everything she sells. The total amount she sold is $25,000, so her commission is:

$25,000 x 0.16 = $4000

Adding her basic salary and commission, her total monthly earnings are:

$1200 + $4000 = $5200

Now, we need to calculate how much Kristy allocated to insurance. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills, and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings. To find 95% of her earnings, we multiply her total earnings by 0.95:

$5200 x 0.95 = $4940

This means that Kristy allocated $4940 to her monthly expenses. To find out how much she allocated to insurance, we subtract this amount from her total earnings:

$5200 - $4940 = $260

Answer: 260
