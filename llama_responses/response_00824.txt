Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of classrooms with 30 desks in each classroom. Since one-third of the 15 classrooms have 30 desks in each, then the number of classrooms with 30 desks is:

1/3 * 15 = 5

So, there are 5 classrooms with 30 desks in each. Since the rest of the classrooms have 25 desks in each, the number of classrooms with 25 desks is:

15 - 5 = 10

So, the total number of classrooms is 10.

Now, let's find the total number of desks. Each classroom with 30 desks can accommodate 30 students, and each classroom with 25 desks can accommodate 25 students. So, the total number of students that the school can accommodate is:

5 * 30 + 10 * 25 = 5 * 30 + 10 * 25

= 150

The school can accommodate 150 students.
