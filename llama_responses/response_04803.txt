Let's break down the cost of the ingredients:

* Apples: 2 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $4.00
* Pie crust: $2.00
* Lemon: $0.50
* Butter: $1.50

Total cost of ingredients: $4.00 + $2.00 + $0.50 + $1.50 = $7.50

Since the pie serves 8 people, we need to divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost per serving:

$7.50 รท 8 = $0.94
