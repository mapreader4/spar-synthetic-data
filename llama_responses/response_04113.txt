Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's let's find out how much fabric Nicholas bought. Since Nicholas bought 6 times as much fabric as Kenneth, and Kenneth bought 700oz of fabric, then Nicholas must have bought 6 * 700 = 4200oz of fabric.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how much fabric cost Nicholas paid for his fabric. If Kenneth bought 700oz of fabric for $40, then Nicholas must have paid 700 / 40 = 17.5 for his fabric.

Step 3: Finally, let's compare the amount of money Nicholas paid with the amount of money Kenneth paid. Nicholas paid 4200oz of fabric cost 17.5, which is more than Kenneth paid for his fabric. So, the answer is:

Answer: 17.5
