Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that Tommy has 13 items in his pencil case, and that the pens are twice as many as the pencils. Let's say the number of pencils is x. Then, we know that the number of pens is 2x. We also know that there is one eraser.

We can set up an equation to represent the number of pencils: 2x = 13 - 1. We know that the number of pencils is x, and we want to find the value of x.

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: x = (13 - 1) / 2. This gives us the value of x as 6.5.

So, the number of pencils is 6.5.
