Let's break down the total number of sweet treats: 20 cookies + 25 cupcakes + 35 brownies = 80 sweet treats.

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the total number of sweet treats by 20 to find out how many each student will receive:

80 sweet treats รท 20 students = 4

So, each student will receive 4 sweet treats.
