Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The plane departed from London at 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday, and arrived in New York 18 hours later. This means that the plane took 18 hours to travel from London to New York.

2. The plane took another flight from New York to Cape Town the day it arrived in New York. This means that the plane departed from New York at 10:00 p.m. ET (18 hours after 6:00 a.m. ET).

3. Since the plane arrived in Cape Town at 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, it took the plane 16 hours to travel from New York to Cape Town (since 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday is 16 hours after 10:00 p.m. ET).

4. To find the total time taken for the flight from New York to Cape Town, we add the 18 hours it took to travel from London to New York to the 16 hours it took to travel from New York to Cape Town: 18 + 16 = 34 hours.
