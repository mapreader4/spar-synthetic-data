Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Selena ran x miles. Josh ran half of that distance, so he ran x/2 miles.

We know that the total distance they ran together is 36 miles, so we can set up the equation x + x/2 = 36.

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 2 to get 2x = 72. Then we can divide both sides by 2 to get x = 36.

So Selena ran 36 miles.
