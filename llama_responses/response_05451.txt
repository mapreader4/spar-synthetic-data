Let's break this down step by step:

The cuffs are 50 cm long, so we need to multiply 2 cuffs by the length of each cuff to get the total length of the lace needed for the cuffs: 2 x 50 cm = 100 cm.

The hem is 300 cm long, and the waist is a third of that length, so we need to calculate a third of 300 cm, which is 300 / 3 = 100 cm. So, we need 100 cm of lace for the waist.

The neckline has 5 ruffles, each using 20 cm of lace, so we need to multiply 5 by 20 cm to get the total length of lace needed for the neckline: 5 x 20 cm = 100 cm.

Now, let's add up the lengths of lace needed for each part of the dress:

100 cm (cuffs) + 100 cm (waist) + 100 cm (neckline) = 300 cm

The total length of lace needed is 300 cm. Since lace costs $6/m, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total length by the price per meter:

300 cm x $6/m = $180

So, Carolyn spends $180 on lace.
