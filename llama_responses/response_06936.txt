Let's break it down step by step.

Gary adds 60 bundles of asparagus at $3.00 each. That is a total of 60 * 3.00 = 180.00.

Next, he adds 40 boxes of grapes at $2.50 each. That is a total of 40 * 2.50 = 100.00.

Finally, he adds 700 apples at $0.50 each. That is a total of 700 * 0.50 = 350.00.

Now, let's add up all the totals:

180.00 + 100.00 + 350.00 = 630.00

So, the total value of the produce is 630.00.

Answer: 630
