Let's start by letting x be the number of children in the family. The total number of granola bars given to the children is 200 - 80 = 120. Since each child received 20 granola bars, we can set up an equation: 20x = 120. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 20 to get x = 6. So, there are 6 children in the family.
