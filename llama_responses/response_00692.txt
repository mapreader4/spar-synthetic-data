Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Edric's monthly salary is $576.
2. We know he works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, which is a total of 8 x 6 = 48 hours a week.
3. To find his hourly rate, we need to divide his monthly salary by the total hours he works in a week. So, we have 576 (monthly salary) / 48 (total hours worked) = 12.

Answer: 12
