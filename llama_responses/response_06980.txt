Let's break this down step by step.

Bill starts with 50 donuts in the box.

He eats 2 on the ride in, leaving 50 - 2 = 48 donuts.

The secretary takes 4 more, leaving 48 - 4 = 44 donuts.

Bill leaves the box on his desk and his coworkers steal half of the remaining donuts. Since there are 44 donuts, half of that is 44 / 2 = 22 donuts.

So, his coworkers steal 22 donuts, leaving 44 - 22 = 22 donuts.

Bill brings the box into the meeting with 22 donuts left.

Answer: 22
