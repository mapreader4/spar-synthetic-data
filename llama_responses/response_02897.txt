Let's break it down step by step.

1. Juanita buys 1 bottle of sunscreen per month, which is 12 bottles in a year.
2. The website offers 30% off her entire purchase.
3. To find the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the total cost of the sunscreen.

The total cost of 12 bottles of sunscreen is 12 x $30.00 = $360.00.
4. Now, we need to calculate 30% of that amount.

30% of $360.00 is 0.3 x $360.00 = $108.00.

5. To find the final cost of the sunscreen after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

$360.00 - $108.00 = $252.00.

Answer: 252.00
