Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information we are given:

- Freyja is 10 years old.
- Eli is 9 years older than Freyja, so Eli is 19 years old.
- Sarah is twice as old as Eli, so Sarah is 38 years old.
- Kaylin is 5 years younger than Sarah.

Now, we can start solving the problem. We know that Freyja is 10 years old. We know that Eli is 19 years old. We can subtract 19 - 10 = 9 from 19 to find Eli's age relative to Freyja, which is 9 years. We know that Sarah is 38 years old. We can subtract 38 - 5 from 38 to find Sarah's age relative to Kaylin, which is 33 years.

Answer: 33
