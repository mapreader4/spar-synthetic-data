Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by converting the given speeds to feet per second:

Cheetah's top speed is 60 mph, which is equal to 60 * 1.5 = 90 feet per second.

Gazelle's top speed is 40 mph, which is equal to 40 * 1.5 = 60 feet per second.

The distance between the two animals is 210 feet.

The cheetah and gazelle are moving in the same direction, so we can add their speeds to find their relative speed:

90 + 60 = 150 feet per second

Now, we can use the formula:

Distance = speed * time

to find the time it would take for the cheetah to catch the gazelle:

210 feet / 150 feet per second = 1.4 seconds

So, the answer is:

Answer: 1.4
