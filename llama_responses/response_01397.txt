Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. Marly adds 2 quarts of milk and 3 times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables.
2. So, in total, he adds 2 quarts of milk, 3 quarts of chicken stock, and 1 quart of pureed vegetables.

Now, let's combine these amounts: 2 + 3 + 1 = 5 quarts.

So, he has a total of 5 quarts of liquid.

3. He divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each.

So, he will need to divide 5 quarts into 3 quarts per bag. To do this, we can divide 5 by 3: 5 รท 3 = 1.67.

So, Marly will need 2 bags.
