Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that a large pizza has 18 slices. Since the teacher orders 6 total pizzas, the total number of slices is 6 x 18 = 108.

We know that each student gets 2 pieces of cheese, so the total number of cheese pieces is 2 x (number of students) = 2x. We also know that there are 8 pieces of cheese leftover, so 2x + 8 = 108. We can solve for x by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

2x + 8 = 108
2x = 108 - 8
2x = 100

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 100 / 2
x = 50

So, there are 50 students in the class.
