Let's start by finding the cost of the drinks Sandy ordered. Three cappuccinos cost 3 x 2 = 6 dollars. Two iced teas cost 2 x 3 = 6 dollars. Two cafe lattes cost 2 x 1.5 = 3 dollars. Two espressos cost 2 x 1 = 2 dollars. The total cost is 6 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 17 dollars.

Now, let's subtract 17 from the 20-dollar bill. 20 - 17 = 3.
