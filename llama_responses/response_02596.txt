Let's break this down step by step.

Let's find the average of his History score, which is the average of 50, 70 and 66. To find the average, we add up the three scores and divide by 3:

50 + 70 + 66 = 186

186 รท 3 = 62

So, his History score is 62.

Now, to find his total score across all 4 subjects, we need to add his 4 scores: 62 + 50 + 70 + 66. The total score is:

62 + 50 + 70 + 66 = 188

Answer: 188
