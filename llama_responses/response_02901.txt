Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cat spends 20 minutes resisting, which means Jenny needs to coax the cat to walk for 20 minutes.
2. The cat walks 64 feet at a rate of 8 feet/minute, which means it will take 64/8 = 8 minutes to walk 64 feet.
3. To find the total time, we add the time spent resisting (20 minutes) to the time it takes to walk 64 feet (8 minutes). 

Answer: 20 + 8 = 28
