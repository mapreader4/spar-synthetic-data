Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of apples harvested.

Mr. Connell harvested 60 apples from his apple tree. So, the number of apples is 60.

Now, let's find the number of peaches harvested.

Mr. Connell harvested 3 times as many peaches from his peach tree. Since 3 times as many means 3 x, so the number of peaches is 3 x 3 = 9.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of apples and the number of peaches.

Number of apples - Number of peaches = 60 - 9 = 51

Answer: 51
