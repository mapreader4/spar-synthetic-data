Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's say the number of muffins Janet bought is x.

The total cost of the muffins is 75 cents each. Since Janet paid $20, the cost of the muffins is 20 x x.

The change she got is $11, which means that the total cost of the muffins is $20 - 11 = $9.

So, 9 is the cost of the muffins. Since each muffin is 75 cents, we can divide the cost by 9 by 75 cents.

9 / 0.75 = 12. So, Janet bought 12 muffins.
