Let's start by finding the number of students who collected cans. The two students who didn't collect any cans are subtracted from the total number of students. So, the number of students who collected cans is 30 - 2 = 28. The 13 students who collected 4 cans each collected a total of 13 * 4 = 52 cans. So, the total number of cans collected is the number of cans collected by the students who collected cans, which is 52, plus the number of cans collected by the two students who didn't collect any, which is 0. So, the total number of cans collected is 52 + 0 = 52.

Answer: 52
