Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of pages Tom can read in one hour. Since he can read 12 pages in 1 hour, then the number of pages he can read in 1 hour is 12.

To find the number of pages he can read in 2 hours, we can multiply the number of pages he can read in 1 hour by 2. This gives us:

12 * 2 = 24

So, the answer is:

Answer: 24
