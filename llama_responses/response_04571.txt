Let's break it down step by step:

Granger has 5 times as many spots as his brother, Cisco, so Granger has 5 spots.

Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as his cousin, Rover, so Cisco has 23 spots (since 46 / 2 = 23).

Granger has 5 spots and Cisco has 23 spots, so to find the total number of spots, we add the two numbers: 5 + 23 = 28.

Answer: 28
