Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the number of glasses Brad sold:

He made 2 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon makes 16 glasses, so he made a total of 2 x 16 = 32 glasses.

He drank 5 glasses himself, so he sold 32 - 5 = 27 glasses.

He sold all but 6 glasses, which means he sold 27 - 6 = 21 glasses.

Now, let's calculate the revenue:

Each glass costs $1.00, so the total revenue is 21 x $1.00 = $21.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost:

He spent $3.50 for every gallon, and he made 2 gallons, so the total cost is 2 x $3.50 = $7.00.

The cost of making lemonade is subtracted from the revenue to find the profit:

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $21.00 - $7.00 = $14.00.

So, the net profit is $14.00.
