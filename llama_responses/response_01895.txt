Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Natalia rode 40 kilometers.
On Tuesday, she rode 50 kilometers.
On Wednesday, she rode 50% fewer kilometers than the day before, so on Wednesday, she rode 40 kilometers (50% of 50 is 25).

The sum of the kilometers from Monday and Wednesday is 40 + 25 = 65.

On Thursday, she rode the same amount of kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Wednesday. So, on Thursday, she rode 65 kilometers.

The total kilometers Natalia rode in total is 40 + 50 + 50 + 40 + 25 + 65 = 185.
