Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Jan can handle 20 claims. Since John can handle 30% more claims than Jan, that means John can handle 20 + 30 = 50 claims.

We know that Missy can handle 15 more claims than John, so we can set up an equation to represent the number of claims Missy can handle: Missy can handle John's claims + 15.

We know that John can handle 50 claims, so we can set up the equation as follows:

Missy can handle 50 - 15 = x

To solve for x, we subtract 15 from 50:

x = 50 - 15 = 35

Answer: 35
