Let's break this problem down step by step.

Gloria wants to buy a $129,000 mountain cabin, but she only has $150 in cash. This means she needs to raise $128,850 ($129,000 - $150) to buy the cabin.

Gloria intends to raise the remaining amount by selling her mature trees for lumber. She has 20 cypress trees, 600 pine trees, and 24 maple trees.

For the cypress trees, she will get $100 each, so she will get a total of 20 x $100 = $2,000.

For the pine trees, she will get $200 each, so she will get a total of 600 x $200 = $120,000.

For the maple trees, she will get $300 each, so she will get a total of 24 x $300 = $7,200.

In total, Gloria will get $2,000 + $120,000 + $7,200 = $129,200.

Since she needs to raise $128,850 to buy the cabin, she will have $129,200 - $128,850 = $350 left after paying for the cabin.
