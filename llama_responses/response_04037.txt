Let's break it down step by step.

Susan has 21 cats and Bob has 3 cats. If Susan gives 4 cats to Robert, then Susan will be left with 21 - 4 = 17 cats. Bob has 3 cats, so Bob has 3 cats. To find out how many more cats Susan has than Bob, we need to subtract the number of cats Bob has from the number of cats Susan has. So, 17 - 3 = 14. So, Susan has 14 more cats than Bob.
