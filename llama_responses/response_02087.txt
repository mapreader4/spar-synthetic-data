Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total amount of money that the private company raised, which is $2500.

Then, they donated 80% of that amount to the public foundation. To find the amount donated to the foundation, we need to multiply the total amount by the percentage of the total amount.

80% of 2500 is equal to 80/100 * 2500 = 2000.

So, the total amount donated to the foundation is $2000.

Now, we need to find out how much each organization will receive. There are 8 organizations that received the donation. To find the amount each organization will receive, we can divide the total amount donated to the number of organizations.

2000 / 8 = 250.

So, each organization will receive $250.
