Let's start by finding the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length times width times height times depth, so the volume of the pool is 10 x 8 x 6 = 60 cubic feet. Since the pool holds 60 cubic feet of water, and Gary needs one quart of chlorine for every 120 cubic feet of water, we can divide 60 by 120 to find out how many quarts of chlorine he needs. 60 / 120 = 0.5, so Gary needs 0.5 quarts of chlorine. Since chlorine costs $3 a quart, we can multiply 0.5 x 3 to find the cost of chlorine. 0.5 x 3 = 1.5. So, the answer is:

Answer: 1.5
