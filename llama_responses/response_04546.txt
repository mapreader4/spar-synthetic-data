Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many pieces of wood Gerald has left after making 24 tables.

For each table, Gerald uses 12 pieces of wood. So, to make 24 tables, he will use 24 * 12 = 288 pieces of wood.

Now, to make chairs, Gerald uses 8 pieces of wood. So, if he makes x chairs, he will use 8 * x pieces of wood.

We want to find out how many chairs he can make.

Let's set up an equation to represent this.

Let x be the number of chairs Gerald can make.

We know that Gerald has 672 - 288 = 384 pieces of wood left over.

We can write an equation to represent this:

8x = 384

We can solve for x.

8x = 384 / 8 = 48

So, Gerald can make 48 chairs.
