Let's break it down step by step.

Matt spends 80 minutes washing the outside of his car. This means that the outside of his car is 80 minutes.

He also spends 1/4 of that amount of time cleaning the inside of his car. 1/4 of 80 minutes is 20 minutes.

To find the total time spent cleaning his car, we add the time spent cleaning the outside and the time spent cleaning the inside. 80 minutes + 20 minutes is 100 minutes.

Answer: 100
