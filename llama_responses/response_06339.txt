Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Sofia and her mother buy 10 kgs of oranges.

2. Then, they add 5 more kgs to the initial quantity because their neighbor wants some supplies.

So, the total quantity of oranges they buy initially is 10 kgs + 5 kgs = 15 kgs.

3. For the next two weeks, they need to buy twice as many oranges each week. This means they need to buy 15 kgs * 2 = 30 kgs of oranges for each week.

4. Since they need to buy for two weeks, they need to buy 30 kgs * 2 = 60 kgs of oranges in total for the next two weeks.

5. To find the total quantity of oranges they would have bought after three weeks, we add the initial quantity to the quantity needed for the next two weeks:

Initial quantity: 15 kgs
Quantity for next two weeks: 60 kgs

Total quantity: 15 kgs + 60 kgs = 75 kgs

Answer: 75
