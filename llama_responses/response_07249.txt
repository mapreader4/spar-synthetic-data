Let's break it down step by step:

Let's first find the total number of words Vinnie wrote.

Vinnie wrote 450 words on Saturday.
Vinnie wrote 650 words on Sunday.

To find the total number of words Vinnie wrote, we add the two numbers: 450 + 650 = 1100.

Since the limit is 1000 words, Vinnie has exceeded the limit by 100 words.

Answer: 100
