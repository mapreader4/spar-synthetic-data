Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of the backpacks without the monogramming. Since the backpacks are 20% off of $20.00, we need to find 20% of $20.00.

To find 20% of $20.00, we can multiply $20.00 by 0.20.

$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

So, the cost of the backpacks without the monogramming is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Now, we need to add the cost of monogramming each backpack, which is $12.00 each.

$16.00 + $12.00 = $28.00

So, the total cost of the backpacks is $28.00.
