Let's break this down step by step.

Mars can be seen until 12:10 AM. This means that 12:10 AM is the time when Mars disappears from the sky.

Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes after 12:10 AM. To find this time, we add 2 hours and 41 minutes to 12:10 AM:

12:10 AM + 2 hours = 2:10 AM
2:10 AM + 41 minutes = 2:51 AM

So, Jupiter appears at 2:51 AM.

Uranus appears 3 hours and 16 minutes after Jupiter. To find this time, we add 3 hours and 16 minutes to 2:51 AM:

2:51 AM + 3 hours = 5:51 AM
5:51 AM + 16 minutes = 6:07 AM

So, Uranus appears at 6:07 AM.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes after 6:00 AM Uranus appears. We can subtract 6:00 AM from 6:07 AM to get:

6:07 AM - 6:00 AM = 7 minutes
