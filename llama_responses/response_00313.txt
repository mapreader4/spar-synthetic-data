Let's say the number of toys Hash has is x.

We know that Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. This means that the number of toys Hash has is 1/2 as many toys as Bill has, so the number of toys Hash has is 1/2 x.

We know that Bill has 60 toys, so the number of toys Hash has is 1/2 of 60, which is 30.

So, the total number of toys the boys have is Hash's number of toys, which is 30 + 30, which is 60.
