Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The 3 cars that take 40 minutes each to repair will take a total of 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to repair.
2. The remaining 2 cars will take 50% longer each to repair, so they will take 40 * 1.5 = 60 minutes each to repair. The total time to repair the remaining cars is 60 * 2 = 120 minutes.
3. The total time to repair all the cars is 120 + 120 = 240 minutes.
4. John makes $20 per hour, so the total money he makes is 240 / 60 = 4 hours.
5. Since John repairs cars for 5 hours, the total money he makes is 4 * 20 = 80.

Answer: 80
