Let's break this down step by step.

First, 90% of people RSVPed, which means 0.9 * 200 = 180 people RSVPed. Then, 80% of those people who RSVPed actually showed up, which is 0.8 * 180 = 144 people. Then, 10 people who showed up didn't get a gift, which is 200 - 144 = 56 people. So, Jack needs to send thank you cards to 56 people.
