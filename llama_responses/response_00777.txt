Let's break this down step by step.

Mara rode the bumper car two times, so she spent 2 * 2 = 4 dollars. Riley rode the space shuttle four times, so he spent 4 * 4 = 16 dollars. They both rode the Ferris wheel three times, so they spent 3 * 5 = 15 dollars. 

So, in total, they spent 4 + 16 + 15 = 35 dollars. 

Answer: 35
