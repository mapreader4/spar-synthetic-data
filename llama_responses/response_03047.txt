Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The ticket cost is $10.
* The auditorium has 20 rows and each row has 10 seats.
* 3/4 of the seats were sold.

First, let's find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 20 rows and each row has 10 seats, the total number of seats is 20 * 10 = 200 seats.

Now, we know that 3/4 of the seats were sold. To find the number of sold seats, we can multiply the total number of seats by 3/4:

200 * 3/4 = 150

Now, we need to multiply the number of sold seats by the ticket cost to find the total amount of money earned from the play:

150 * $10 = $1500

Answer: 1500
