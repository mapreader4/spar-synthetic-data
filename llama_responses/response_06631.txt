Let's break it down step by step:

Let's start with the 20% of people who receive the stimulus. There are 1000 people in the city, and 20% of that is 0.2 * 1000 = 200 people. They each receive $2000.

The government gets back 5 times the amount of money that the 200 people get, so they get 5 * 2000 = 10,000. This is the revenue. 

The cost to give out the 2000 to the 200 people is the cost, so the cost is also 2000. 

The government's profit is the revenue minus the cost. 10,000 - 2000 = 8000. 

Answer: 8000.
