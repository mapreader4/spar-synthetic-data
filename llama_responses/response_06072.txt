Let's break it down step by step.

Sarah uses 1 ounce of shampoo, so she uses 1 ounce of shampoo daily.

Sarah uses conditioner, and she uses half as much conditioner as shampoo, so she uses 0.5 ounces of conditioner daily.

To find the total volume of shampoo and conditioner used in two weeks, we multiply the daily usage by 2.

1 ounce of shampoo * 2 = 2 ounces of shampoo
0.5 ounces of conditioner * 2 = 1 ounce of conditioner

The total volume of shampoo and conditioner used is 2 ounces of shampoo + 1 ounce of conditioner = 3 ounces.
