Let's break down the total cost of the rental into two parts: the weekday cost and the weekend cost.

The cost for the 3 weekdays (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) is 3 x $420 = $1,260.

The cost for the 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) is 2 x $540 = $1,080.

The total cost for the 5 people is the sum of these two costs: $1,260 + $1,080 = $2,340.

To split the cost evenly among 5 people, we need to divide the total cost by 5: $2,340 รท 5 = $464.

Answer: 464
