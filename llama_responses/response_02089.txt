Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie, and we know the total weight of the pie is 1200 grams. To find out how much Sophia ate, we can multiply the fraction 1/6 by the total weight of the pie:

1/6 * 1200 = 200

So Sophia ate 200 grams of pie.
