Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Sam is twice as old as Sue, so Sam's age is x. Kendra is 3 times as old as Sam, so Kendra's age is 3x. We know Kendra's current age is 18, so 3x = 18. This means x = 18/3 = 6. Since Sam is twice as old as Sue, Sue's age is also 6.

Now, let's find their total age in 3 years. In 3 years, Sam will be 6 + 3 = 9, and Sue will be 6 + 3 = 9 as well. So, their total age in 3 years will be 9 + 9 = 18. 

Answer: 18
