Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, I'll calculate the total number of grams of birdseed Leah has:

3 boxes of birdseed (new) = 3 x 225 grams = 675 grams
5 boxes of birdseed (already in pantry) = 5 x 225 grams = 1125 grams
Total birdseed = 675 grams + 1125 grams = 1800 grams

Next, I'll calculate the total number of grams of birdseed consumed by the parrot and cockatiel per week:

Parrot eats 100 grams/week
Cockatiel eats 50 grams/week
Total birdseed consumed per week = 100 grams + 50 grams = 150 grams

Now, I'll divide the total birdseed Leah has by the total birdseed consumed per week to find out how many weeks the birdseed will last:

1800 grams (total birdseed) รท 150 grams (total birdseed consumed per week) = 12 weeks

Answer: 12
