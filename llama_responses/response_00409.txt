Let’s break it down step by step.

Let’s start by finding out how many cars he has sold so far.

For the first 3 days, he sold 5 cars each day, so that is 3 * 5 = 15 cars.

For the next 4 days, he sold 3 cars each day, so that is 4 * 3 = 12 cars.

So, in total, he has sold 15 + 12 = 27 cars.

Since he needs 50 cars in total, he needs 50 - 27 = 23 more cars to sell for the remaining days.

Answer: 23
