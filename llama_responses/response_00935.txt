Let's start by identifying the total amount of flour Jim has:

Jim has 200g of flour in the cupboard and 100g on the kitchen counter, so he has a total of 200 + 100 = 300g of flour. He also has 100g in the pantry, so the total amount of flour is 300 + 100 = 400g.

Since one loaf of bread requires 200g of flour, we can divide the total amount of flour by 200g to find the number of loaves Jim can bake:

400g รท 200g = 2

So, Jim can bake 2 loaves of bread.
