Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's identify the information given in the problem: Jamie got the cat down from a 6-foot tree by climbing 12 rungs of his ladder. This means that the distance he had to climb is equal to the height of the tree, which is 6 feet.

The current tree is 20 feet tall, so Jamie needs to climb a distance of 20 - 6 = 14 feet to get the cat down from the tree. Since each rung of the ladder is 1 foot, Jamie has to climb 14 rungs to get the cat down from the tree.

Answer: 14
