To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the information given in the statement. The statement is "Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house." This means that the size of Kennedy's house is 4 times the size of Benedict's house. We can represent this as an equation:

Kennedy's house = 4 * Benedict's house

The problem asks us to find the size of Benedict's house. If we know the size of Kennedy's house, we can solve for Benedict's house.

We are given that Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet. We can substitute this value into the equation:

Kennedy's house = 4 * Benedict's house
10000 = 4 * Benedict's house

To solve for Benedict's house, we can divide both sides by 4:

Benedict's house = 10000 / 4
Benedict's house = 2500

Answer: 2500
