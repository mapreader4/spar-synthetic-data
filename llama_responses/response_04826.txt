Let's break down the information given:

Tyson scored 3 points 15 times, so that is 3 x 15 = 45 points.
Tyson scored 2 points 12 times, so that is 2 x 12 = 24 points.
In total, he scored 45 + 24 = 69 points.
We know that the total points is 75, so we need to find the number of times he scored one point that will make the total 75. Let's call that number x.
The equation is 69 + x = 75.
Subtract 69 from both sides of the equation to get x = 6.
Answer: 6
