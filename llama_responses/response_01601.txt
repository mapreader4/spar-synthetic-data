Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of students is x.

The number of short students is 2/5 of the total number of students. So, we can set up an equation:

2x/5 = 90

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

2x = 450

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 225

So, the total number of students with average height is 225.
