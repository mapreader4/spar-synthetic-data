Let's start by analyzing the given information. We know that 1 ounce of Dawn liquid soap can make 200,000 bubbles. We also know that Dr. Bronner's liquid soap can make twice as many bubbles as Dawn liquid soap, so we can say that Dr. Bronner's liquid soap can make 400,000 bubbles per ounce.

Now, we want to find out how many bubbles can be made from a half-ounce of a mixture of Dawn and Dr. Bronner's liquid soaps. Since we have a half-ounce of the mixture, we can use the information about the number of bubbles that can be made by Dr. Bronner's liquid soap, which is 200,000 bubbles per ounce. We can divide 200,000 by 0.5 to find that Dr. Bronner's liquid soap in this mixture can make 400,000 / 0.5 = 400,000 bubbles.

Now, we can find out how many bubbles Dawn liquid soap can make in this mixture. Since Dawn liquid soap can make 200,000 bubbles per ounce, and we have a half-ounce of the mixture, we can multiply 200,000 by 0.5 to find that Dawn liquid soap can make 100,000 bubbles in this mixture.

Now we can add the number of bubbles that Dawn liquid soap and Dr. Bronner's liquid soap can make together. We have 100,000 bubbles from Dawn liquid soap and 400,000 bubbles from Dr. Bronner's liquid soap. We can add these numbers together to find that the total number of bubbles that can be made from the mixture is 500,000.

So, the answer is: Answer: 500,000.
