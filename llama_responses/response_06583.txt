Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the barbell. If the barbell costs 1/10 as much as the rack, then we know that the cost of the barbell is 2500 / 10 = 250.

The cost of the rack is given as 2500, so we know that the total cost of the rack and the barbell is 2500 + 250 = 2750.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 2750
