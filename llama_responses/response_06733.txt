Let's break this problem down step by step.

Tommy has a flag that is 5 feet wide and 4 feet tall. That means the area of the flag is 5 x 4 = 20 square feet. He wants to paint both sides, so he needs to paint 20 square feet. A quart of paint is good for 4 square feet, so Tommy will need 5 quarts of paint to paint the flag. 5 quarts of paint will cost 5 x $2 = $10. Answer: $10.
