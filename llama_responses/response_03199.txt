Let's break this down step by step.

Horatio writes a sonnet for his lady fair, and each sonnet is 14 lines long. He writes 7 sonnets before his lady fair leaves him. So, the number of sonnets written before she leaves is 7.

To find the total number of sonnets written by Horatio, we need to add the 7 sonnets he wrote before his lady fair left him to the remaining sonnets he writes after she leaves him.

Let's assume he writes more sonnets after she leaves him. Let's call this number x. Then, the total number of sonnets written by Horatio is 7 + x.

The total number of lines written by Horatio is 14 lines per sonnet, so the total number of lines is 7 x 14 = 98. Since each sonnet is 14 lines long, the total number of sonnets is 98 / 14 = 7.

So, the total number of sonnets written by Horatio is 7 + 7 = 14.

Answer: 14
