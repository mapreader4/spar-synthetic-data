Let's break it down step by step.

Joanne makes $16.00 per hour at her main job, and she works 8 hours a day. So, her total earnings from her main job in a day is:

16.00 x 8 = 128.00

She also has a part-time job where she makes $13.50 per hour, and she works 2 hours a day. So, her total earnings from her part-time job in a day is:

13.50 x 2 = 27.00

She works 5 days a week. So, her total earnings in a week is:

128.00 + 27.00 = 155.00

Answer: 155
