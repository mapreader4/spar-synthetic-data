Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of boxes Marissa ties is x.

Marissa uses 0.7 feet of ribbon to tie each box, so the total amount of ribbon used will be 0.7x.

The total amount of ribbon used is equal to the total number of boxes times the amount of ribbon used per box, which is 0.7.

We know that Marissa has 4.5 feet of ribbon, so the total amount of ribbon used is 0.7x = 4.5.

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.7:

0.7x = 4.5

x = 4.5 / 0.7

x = 6
