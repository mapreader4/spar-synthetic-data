Let the number of infections during the first wave be x.

Let the number of infections during the second wave be 4x.

The total number of infections during the second wave is 2 weeks.

The number of infections during the first wave is 300.

The number of infections during the second wave is 4x. So, the number of infections during the second wave is 4 * 300, which is 1200.

So, the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks is 1200.
