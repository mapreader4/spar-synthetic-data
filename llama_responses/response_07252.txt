Let's break this down step by step.

Jim bought 10 gallons of gas at 2.00/gallon in North Carolina. That will cost 10 x 2.00 = 20.00 dollars.

Then, he bought another 10 gallons of gas in Virginia, where he paid 1.00 more per gallon. So, the cost of that 10 gallons will be 10 x (2.00 + 1.00) = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 dollars.

In total, Jim spent 20.00 + 30.00 = 50.00 dollars on gas.
