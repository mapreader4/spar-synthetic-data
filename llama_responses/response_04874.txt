Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of green macaroons Fran ate. Fran ate 15 green macaroons. Then, Fran ate twice as many red macaroons as green macaroons, which means Fran ate 15 x 2 = 30 red macaroons.

Fran started with 40 green macaroons, and ate 15 green macaroons. So, the number of green macaroons remaining is 40 - 15 = 25.

Fran also started with 50 red macaroons, and ate 30 red macaroons. So, the number of red macaroons remaining is 50 - 30 = 20.

The answer is: Answer: 20.
