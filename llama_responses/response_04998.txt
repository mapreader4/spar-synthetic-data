Let's break this down step by step.

Tabitha started with 1 color in her hair when she was 15 years old. Each year, she adds a new color. So, after one year, she has 2 colors, after 2 years she has 3 colors, and so on.

Since she will have 8 colors in 3 years, that means she will have 8 colors in the year 15 + 3 = 18.

Since she started with 1 color at 15 years old, and she will have 8 colors at 18 years old, we need to figure out how many colors she has now.

Let's count the number of colors she has now:

15 years old: 1 color
16 years old: 2 colors
17 years old: 3 colors
18 years old: 4 colors

She has 4 colors now.

So, the current age of Tabitha is 17 years old.

Answer: 17
