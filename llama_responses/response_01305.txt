Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's let the number of bats be x.

We know that Randy has 1 more baseball glove than 7 times the number of bats he has. So, let's write that as an equation: x + 7x = 29.

We can solve this equation for x. We can subtract 7x from both sides of the equation to get 0, like so:

x + 7x - 7x = 29 - 7x = 0.

This simplifies to x = 29.

So, Randy has 29 - 7 = 22 bats. So, he has 22 bats.
