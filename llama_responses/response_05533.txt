Let's break it down step by step.

The developer bought 4 acres of land for $1,863. The total cost is:

4 x 1,863 = 7,352

He then splits the land into 9 lots. To find the price per lot, we need to divide the total cost by the number of lots:

7,352 รท 9 = 816.44

So, the developer should sell each lot for at least 816.44 to break even.
