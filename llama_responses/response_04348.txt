Let's break it down step by step:

1. John bought 30 ducks for $10 each, so the total cost is 30 x $10 = $300.
2. Each duck weighs 4 pounds, so the total weight of the ducks is 30 x 4 = 120 pounds.
3. John sells the ducks for $5 per pound, so the total revenue is 120 pounds x $5 = $600.
4. To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the revenue: $600 (revenue) - $300 (cost) = $300.

Answer: 300
