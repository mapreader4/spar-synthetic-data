Let's think step by step.

Let's say the number of students in Grade 6 is x.

The total number of students in all three grades is 100.

The number of students in Grade 4 is 30. The number of students in Grade 5 is 35.

So, the number of students in Grade 6 is the remaining number of students. We can set up an equation:

30 + 35 + x = 100

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to get:

35 + x = 70

So, x = 70.

Answer: 70
