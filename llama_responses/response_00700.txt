Let's break down the information given:

1. Two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock, so a single brown sock costs 25 cents.

2. Two white socks cost 45 cents, which is 20 cents more than a single brown sock.

3. So, the difference between the cost of two white socks and a single brown sock is 25 cents. If the two white socks cost 45 cents, then the cost of a single brown sock is 45 - 25 = 20 cents.

4. Now, we need to find the cost of 15 brown socks. If a single brown sock costs 20 cents, then 15 brown socks will cost 15 x 20 = 300 cents.

Answer: 300
