To find the total length of the hem, we need to multiply the length of each stitch by the number of stitches per minute, and the number of stitches, which is 24, and then multiply that by the total length of the hem, which is 3 feet. This is because the hem is 3 feet long, and each stitch is 1/4 of an inch. 

The length of each stitch is 1/4 inch, so the number of stitches in one foot is 12. So, the total number of stitches in 3 feet is 3 x 12 = 36. 

Now we can find the time it takes Jenna to hem her dress by dividing the total number of stitches by the number of stitches per minute. 36 stitches / 24 stitches per minute = 1.5 minutes.
