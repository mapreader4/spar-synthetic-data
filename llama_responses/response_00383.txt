Let's break it down step by step:

Anna starts with 60 cupcakes.

She gives away 4/5 of the cupcakes to her classmates, which is 24 cupcakes.

Now, she has 60 - 24 = 36 cupcakes left.

Then, she eats 1/5 of the remaining cupcakes, which is 36 * 1/5 = 7 cupcakes.

So, she has 36 - 7 = 29 cupcakes left.

Answer: 29
