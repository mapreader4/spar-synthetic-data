Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of biscuits baked in the morning: 40 biscuits.

Next, let's identify the number of biscuits baked in the afternoon: 20 biscuits.

Now, let's subtract the number of biscuits baked in the afternoon from the total number of biscuits baked in the morning: 40 - 20 = 20.

Since the question asks for the difference in the number of biscuits baked, we can conclude that Yanna baked 20 biscuits more biscuits than butter cookies.
