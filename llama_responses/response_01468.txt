Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the distance that Troy walks to school and back. We know that Troy's home is 75 meters away from school, so the distance Troy walks to school and back is 2 x 75 = 150 meters.

Step 2: Find the distance that Emily walks to school and back. We know that Emily's home is 98 meters away from school, so the distance Emily walks to school and back is 2 x 98 = 196 meters.

Step 3: Find the difference between the two distances. We know that Troy walks 150 meters and Emily walks 196 meters. We want to find how much farther Emily walks in five days. So, we subtract 150 - 196 = 46 meters.

Answer: 46
