Let's break it down step by step:

1. The chair is the first item. Let's say the price of the chair is x. So, John buys the chair for x dollars.
2. The table is 3 times the price of the chair, so the price of the table is 3x.
3. The couch is 5 times the price of the table, so the price of the couch is 5(3x).
4. John paid $380 for all these items. This means that 3x + 5(3x) + x = 380.
5. Simplify the equation: 3x + 15x + x = 380.
6. Add x to both sides of the equation: 3x + 15x + x + x = 380 + x.
7. Subtract x from both sides: 3x + 15x = 380.
8. Subtract 380 from both sides: 3x = 380 - 380.
9. 3x = 0.
