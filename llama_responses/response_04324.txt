Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total amount of money Carmela has. She has 7 dollars and each of her 4 cousins has 2 dollars, so the total amount of money her cousins have is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars. The total amount of money Carmela and her cousins have is 7 + 8 = 15 dollars.

Now, to make it so that Carmela and her cousins have the same amount of money, we need to find a way to give each of her cousins some amount of money from Carmela's 15 dollars. Let's say we give each of her cousins x dollars. Then, the amount of money Carmela will have left is 15 - 4x.

We know that Carmela and her cousins will have the same amount of money, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

Carmela's money = cousins' money

We can write this as:

15 - 4x = x

To solve for x, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation to get:

15 = 4x + x

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

0 = x

So, x = 0. This means that Carmela will have 0 dollars left after giving each of her cousins some amount of money. But we know that she has 15 dollars, so she cannot give 0 dollars to her cousins.

Let's try again. Let's say we give each of her cousins y dollars. Then, the amount of money Carmela will have left is 15 - 4y.

We can write this as:

15 - 4y = y

To solve for y, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation to get:

15 = 5y

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

0 = y

So, y = 3. This means that Carmela will have 3 dollars left after giving each of her cousins 3 dollars.
