Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the time it takes for the runner to run the first 10 miles. Since the runner can run 10 miles in 1 hour, the time it takes to run 10 miles is 1 hour.

The total distance left to run is 26 - 10 = 16 miles. The runner runs the remaining distance at 80% of his speed. So, the time it takes to run the remaining distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 16 / 0.8 = 20 hours

So, the total time it takes to complete the marathon is the sum of the time it takes to run the first 10 miles and the time it takes to run the remaining distance:

Time = 1 hour + 20 hours = 21 hours

Answer: 21
