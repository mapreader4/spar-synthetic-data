Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume that the total profit is $60000, and company B gets 40% of that profit.

We can represent the total profit as 60000.

Since company B gets 40% of the total profit, we can set up an equation to solve for the profit that company A gets:

Let x be the profit that company A gets.

The equation would be:

0.4x = 60000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 60000 / 0.4

x = 150000

So, company A gets $150,000.
