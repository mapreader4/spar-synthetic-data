Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. We know that Al is 25 pounds heavier than Ben.
2. We know that Ben is 16 pounds lighter than Carl.
3. We know that Ed weighs 146 pounds and is 38 pounds lighter than Al.
4. We need to find the weight of Carl.

From the information provided, we can set up an equation to represent the weight of Carl.

Al - 25 = Ben
Ben - 16 = Carl

We can subtract 25 from both sides of the equation to get:

Al - 25 - 25 = Ben - 16
0 = Carl

Now we can solve for Carl.

0 = Carl - 16

Carl = 25 + 16
Carl = 41

Answer: 41
