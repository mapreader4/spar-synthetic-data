Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the original price is $350. The sale price is $140.

To find the percentage off, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price.

350 - 140 = 210

To find the percentage off, we need to divide the difference by the original price.

210 รท 350 = 0.6

So, Asia got 60% off at the sale.
