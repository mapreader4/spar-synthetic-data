Let's break it down step by step.

There were 15 games in total.

Yolanda scored 345 points over the entire season.

There were 15 games over the season.

Yolanda averaged 4 free throws (worth one point), and 5 two-point baskets per game.

To find the average number of three-point baskets she made per game, we need to subtract the number of free throws and two-point baskets from the total points.

The number of three-point baskets she made is the total points minus the free throws and two-point baskets.

Yolanda scored 345 points over the entire season.

Subtract 4 points (free throws) from 345 points.

Subtract 5 * 2 = 10 points (two-point baskets).

Subtract 345 - 14 = 331 points (free throws and two-point baskets).

The number of three-point baskets she made per game is 331 divided by 15.

331 / 15 = 22.2.

Answer: 22.2
