Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the values of the bills Samuel has:

* $5 bills: 5
* $10 bills: 1
* $20 bills: 4

Now, let's find the total value of the $10 bills: $10.

Samuel has 1 $10-bill, which is $10.

Next, let's find the total value of the $20 bills: $20 * 4 = $80.

Now, let's add the values of the $10 bills and the $20 bills to find the total value of all the bills: $10 + $80 = $90.

Samuel has a total of $90 in his wallet.

Answer: 90
