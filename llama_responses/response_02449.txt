Let's break it down step by step.

Yanna bought 10 shirts at $5 each, so the total cost of the shirts is 10 x 5 = $50.

She also bought 3 pairs of sandals at $3 each, so the total cost of the sandals is 3 x 3 = $9.

The total cost of the shirts and sandals is 50 + 9 = $59.

Yanna gave a $100 bill, so she got back a $100 - $59 = $41.00.
