Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of bike clamps given to customers. Since the store gives 2 bike clamps for every bike sold, we need to multiply the total number of bikes sold by 2.

The store sells 19 bikes in the morning and 27 bikes in the afternoon. To find the total number of bikes sold, we add the two numbers together: 19 + 27 = 46.

Now, we multiply the total number of bikes sold by 2 to find the total number of bike clamps given to customers: 46 * 2 = 92.

Answer: 92
