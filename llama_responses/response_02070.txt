To find the total cost of the expired yogurt, we need to calculate the total cost of the yogurt before the refund. The total cost is the number of packs times the cost of each pack. 80 packs of yogurt, each at 12 dollars, will be 80 x 12 = 960. 40% of the 80 packs were expired. 0.4 * 80 = 32 packs. The cost of the expired yogurt is 32 packs * 12 = 384. The amount Bob was refunded is 384 dollars.
