Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how much money Marco has. Marco has $24. Then, he gives Mary half of his money. Half of 24 is 12. So, Mary now has 15 + 12 = 27.

Then, Mary spends $5. So, Mary has 27 - 5 = 22.

Now, we need to find out how much more Mary has than Marco. Since Marco has 24 and Mary has 22, Mary has 2 more than Marco.
