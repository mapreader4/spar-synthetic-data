Let's think step by step.

Let's first find the total number of plants Carter has now. Carter has 9 plants and he has 3 seed packets. So, the total number of plants is 9.

Now, Carter wants to have a total of 12 plants in his backyard. To find the number of seed packets needed, we subtract the number of plants Carter has from the total number of plants he wants.

So, the number of seed packets needed is:

12 - 9 = 3

Answer: 3
