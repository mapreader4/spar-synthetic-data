Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. John writes 3 stories every week, which is 3 x 50 = 150 pages.
2. Each year, he writes a novel that is 1200 pages, which is 1200 / 150 = 8 novels.
3. Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, which means that 2 pages = 1 sheet.
4. To write 150 pages, John needs 150 / 2 = 75 sheets.
5. To write 8 novels, John needs 8 x 75 = 600 sheets.
6. In total, John needs 600 + 75 = 675 sheets.

Answer: 675
