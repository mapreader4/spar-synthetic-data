Let's start by calculating the cost of buying 8 pints of paint individually.

Cost of 8 pints = 8 pints x $8.00 per pint = $64.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a gallon of paint.

Cost of a gallon = $55.00

To find out how much money Christine will save by buying the gallon of paint instead of 8 pints, we'll subtract the cost of the gallon from the cost of buying 8 pints.

Savings = Cost of 8 pints - Cost of a gallon
= $64.00 - $55.00
= $9.00

So, Christine will save $9.00 by buying the gallon of paint instead of 8 pints.
