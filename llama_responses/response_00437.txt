Let's break this problem down step by step:

Let's first find the number of chickens sold. Let's call the number of chickens sold x.

Since each chicken costs $1.50, and he makes a profit of $65, we can set up the equation as follows:

1.50x + 2x = 65

We can subtract 1.50 from both sides to get:

x = 65 - 1.50 = 63.50

Now, we need to find out how many 2 pounds of feed each chicken will need. Each chicken will need 2 pounds of feed, so we can multiply the number of chickens by 2:

2x = 63.50 / 1.50 = 42

So, Lao sold 42 chickens.
