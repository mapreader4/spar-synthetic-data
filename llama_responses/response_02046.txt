Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of coins each bank teller has.

Each bank teller has 10 rolls of coins. Each roll has 25 coins. So, each bank teller has 10 x 25 = 250 coins.

Now, let's find the total number of coins for four bank tellers.

4 bank tellers have 4 x 250 = 1000 coins.

Answer: 1000
