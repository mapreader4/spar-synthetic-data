Let's start by using the information that each pair of pants cost the same price, and that the total cost of the 2 pairs of pants is $62.

Let's say the price of 1 pair of pants is x.

Then, the cost of 2 pairs of pants is 2x.

Since the total cost of 2 pairs of pants is $62, we can set up an equation:

2x = 62

To find the price of 1 pair of pants, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 62 / 2
x = 31

So, the price of 1 pair of pants is $31.
