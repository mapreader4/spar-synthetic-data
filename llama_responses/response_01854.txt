Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of bushels of corn picked, which is 2.

Each bushel of corn has 80 ears, and each ear weighs.5 pounds. So, the total weight of corn picked in 2 bushels would be 2 * 80 *.5 = 160 pounds.

Now, we need to convert the weight from pounds to cobs. There are 16 cobs in a bushel, so the total number of cobs picked would be 160 /.5 * 16 = 20.

Answer: 20
