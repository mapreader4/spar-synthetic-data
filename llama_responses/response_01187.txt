Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate how much money Brian has left. Brian has $50 and has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas, so he has spent $15. So, Brian has $50 - $15 = $35 left.

Brian needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way, so he will have to pay $7.00 in total for his subway fare. So, he has $35 left after paying for the subway fare.

Now, he can buy apples. A bag of dozen apples costs $14. So, he can buy 3 bags of apples with the $35 he has left.
