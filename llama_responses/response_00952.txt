Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first identify the given information: the fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon in the first week. Then, he sold three times as much in the second week.

To find the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we need to multiply the amount sold in the first week by 2 (since there are two weeks) and then add the result to the amount sold in the second week.

50 kg x 3 = 150 kg

The amount sold in the second week is 150 kg. To find the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we add the amount sold in the first week (50 kg) to the amount sold in the second week (150 kg):

50 kg + 150 kg = 200 kg

Answer: 200
