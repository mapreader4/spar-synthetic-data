Let's break this down step by step.

1. The cost of 1 kilogram of apples is $5.
2. The discount on each kilogram of apples is 40%, which means we need to subtract 40% of 5 from 5 to find the discounted price.
3. 40% of 5 is 2, so the discounted price of 1 kilogram of apples is 5 - 2 = 3.
4. Since Hannah is buying 10 kilograms of apples, we need to multiply the discounted price of 1 kilogram by 10 to find the total cost.
5. 3 * 10 = 30.

Answer: 30
