Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total time Tom runs in a day: 1.5 hours.

Next, we need to multiply the total time by the speed to find the total distance: 1.5 hours * 8 mph = 12 miles.

Since Tom runs for 7 days a week, we multiply the total distance by 7: 12 miles * 7 = 84 miles.

Answer: 84
