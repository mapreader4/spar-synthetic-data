Let's break this down step by step!

The Chicago Cubs scored 2 home runs in the third inning, which is 2.
They scored 1 home run in the fifth inning, which is 2 + 1 = 3.
They scored 2 more home runs in the eighth inning, which is 3 + 2 = 5.

So, the Chicago Cubs scored a total of 5 home runs.

The Cardinals scored 1 home run in the second inning, which is 1.
They scored 1 home run in the fifth inning, which is 1 + 1 = 2.

So, the Cardinals scored a total of 2 home runs.

To find the difference, subtract the number of home runs the Cardinals scored from the number of home runs the Cubs scored:

5 (Cubs) - 2 (Cardinals) = 3
