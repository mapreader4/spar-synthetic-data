Let's break it down step by step:

1. Hearty bought 3 packages of blue and 5 packages of red. So, we know there are 3 + 5 = 8 packages in total.
2. Each package contains 40 beads, so we multiply the number of packages by the number of beads per package to get the total number of beads.
3. 8 packages * 40 beads/package = 8 * 40 = 320 beads.

Answer: 320
