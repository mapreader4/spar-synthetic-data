Let's break this down step by step.

Paula wants to ride the go-karts 1 time, which requires 4 tickets.

Paula wants to ride the bumper cars 4 times, which requires 5 tickets per ride, so the total number of tickets needed for bumper cars is 5 * 4 = 20.

The total number of tickets Paula needs is the sum of the tickets for go-karts and bumper cars: 4 + 20 = 24.

Answer: 24
