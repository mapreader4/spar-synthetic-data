Let's break this problem down step by step.

In the first hour, Dan makes a t-shirt every 12 minutes. This means that in the first hour, he makes a total of 60/12 = 5 t-shirts.

In the second hour, Dan makes a t-shirt every 6 minutes. This means that in the second hour, he makes a total of 60/6 = 10 t-shirts.

In total, Dan makes 5 + 10 = 15 t-shirts over the course of the two hours.

Answer: 15
