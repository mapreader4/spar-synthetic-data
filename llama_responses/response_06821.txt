Let's break down Benjamin's walking routine step by step:

* He walks to work and back home five days a week, which is a total of 12 miles per day (6 miles to work + 6 miles back home). So, he walks 12 miles x 5 days = 60 miles for work and home.
* He walks his dog twice a day every day, which is a total of 4 miles per day (2 miles x 2 times). So, he walks 4 miles x 7 days = 28 miles for dog walking.
* He walks to his best friend's house once a week, which is 1 mile.
* He walks to the convenience store twice a week, which is 3 miles x 2 times = 6 miles.

Now, let's add up all the miles Benjamin walks in a week:

60 miles (work and home) + 28 miles (dog walking) + 1 mile (best friend's house) + 6 miles (convenience store) = 95 miles

Answer: 95
