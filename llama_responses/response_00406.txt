Let the total time to make popcorn and fries be 10 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 1 hour and 60 minutes long. So, the total time to watch the movies is 1 hour and 30 minutes + 1 hour and 60 minutes = 2 hours. The total time is 2 hours.
