Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of pieces of candy that Tabitha caught, which is 22.

Then, we know that Stan caught 13 pieces of candy.  We are also told that Julie caught half the amount of candy that Tabitha caught, so Julie caught 22 / 2 = 11 pieces of candy.

Finally, we are told that Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan, so Carlos caught 13 * 2 = 26 pieces of candy.

To find the total number of pieces of candy that the friends caught, we add up the number of pieces each of them caught: 22 + 11 + 26 = 59.

Answer: 59
