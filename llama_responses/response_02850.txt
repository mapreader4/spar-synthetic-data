Let's start by identifying the income of Mr. John, which is $2000.

Since Mr. John spends 5% of his income on public transport, we can find the amount he spends on transport by multiplying his income by 0.05 (5% as a decimal).

0.05 x 2000 = 100

So, Mr. John spends $100 on transport. To find out how much he has left, we subtract this amount from his income.

2000 - 100 = 1900

Answer: 1900
