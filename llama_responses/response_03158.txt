Let's break it down step by step.

Rex wants to take 40 hour-long lessons, and he wants to have two-hour sessions twice a week. So, in a week, he will take 2 * 2 = 4 hours of lessons. To find out how many weeks it will take Rex to take 40 hours, we can divide 40 hours by the number of hours he takes in a week. 40 / 4 = 10. This means Rex will take 10 weeks to reach his goal.
