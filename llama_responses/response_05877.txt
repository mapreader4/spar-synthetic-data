Let's start by calculating the total cost of the expenses.

The total cost of the lemons is $10, the cost of sugar is $5, and the cost of cups is $3.  So, the total cost of the expenses is $10 + $5 + $3 = $18.

Now, the lemonade is sold at $4 per cup, and they sell a total of 21 cups.  So, the total revenue is 21 * $4 = $84.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the expenses from the revenue.  Profit = Revenue - Expenses.  So, Profit = $84 - $18 = $66.

Answer: 66
