Let's break this down step by step.

Susy started with 100 social media followers. She gained 40 new followers in the first week, so she now has 100 + 40 = 140 followers. In the second week, she gained half of 40, which is 20. So, she now has 140 + 20 = 160 followers. In the third week, she gained half of 20, which is 10. So, she now has 160 + 10 = 170 followers.

Sarah started with 50 social media followers. She gained 90 new followers in the first week, so she now has 50 + 90 = 140 followers. In the second week, she gained a third of 90, which is 30. So, she now has 140 + 30 = 170 followers. In the third week, she gained a third of 30, which is 10. So, she now has 170 + 10 = 180 followers.

Now, let's compare the total number of followers for both girls. Susy has 170 followers, while Sarah has 180 followers. Therefore, Sarah has the most total followers.

Answer: 180
