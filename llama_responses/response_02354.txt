Let's start by using the given information to find the number of books borrowed on the first day. We know that 5 people borrow 2 books each, so the total number of books borrowed on the first day is 5 * 2 = 10. Then, 20 more books are borrowed on the second day, so the total number of books borrowed on the second day is 20. So, the total number of books borrowed is 10 + 20 = 30. The number of books remaining on the shelf after the second day is 100 - 30 = 70. So, the answer is: Answer: 70.
