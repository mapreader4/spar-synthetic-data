Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given that Pete walks on his hands one quarter the speed that Tracy can do cartwheels. Let's say Tracy can do cartwheels at x miles per hour. Then, Pete can walk on his hands at 1/4x miles per hour.

Since Pete walks three times faster than Susan walks forwards, and Tracy does one-handed cartwheels twice as fast as Susan walks forwards, we know that Pete walks 3x times faster than Susan walks forwards. We can set up an equation for this:

Pete's speed = 3 * Susan's speed

Since Pete walks on his hands 1/4x speed, and Susan walks on her feet at x speed, we can set up another equation:

Pete's hand speed = 1/4x
Susan's speed = x

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get:

Pete's speed = 3 * (1/4x)
Pete's speed = 3/4x

Since Pete walks backwards, his speed is 3/4x. However, the question asks for the speed in miles per hour, not the speed on his hands. We know that Pete walks on his hands 2 miles per hour. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

Pete's speed on hands = 2
3/4x = 2
x = 8/3

So, Pete walks backwards at 8/3 miles per hour.
