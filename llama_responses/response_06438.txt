Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say that the woodworker has made 40 legs in total. We know that each table has 4 legs, and each chair has 4 legs. 

If they have used 6 chairs, that means they have used 6 x 4 = 24 legs for the chairs. 

So, they have used 24 legs for the chairs. 

Now, to find the number of tables, we can subtract the number of legs used for the chairs from the total number of legs made. 

40 - 24 = 16

Answer: 16
