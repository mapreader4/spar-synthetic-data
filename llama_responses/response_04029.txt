Let's think step by step.

Let's first calculate how much money the school needs to buy 100 pencils.

Each pencil costs $1.80, so the school needs 100 pencils will cost 100 x 1.80 = 180 dollars.

The school will sell each pop for $1.50, so the total money from the pops will be 100 x 1.50 = 150 dollars.

The school needs 180 dollars to buy 100 pencils, but it only gets 150 dollars from the pops. So, it needs 180 - 150 = 30 more dollars.

Since it costs 90 cents to make each pop, it will take 30 / 0.90 = 33.33 pops to get 30 dollars.

So, the school must sell 33 pops to make up the remaining 30 dollars.
