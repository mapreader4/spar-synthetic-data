Let's start by letting d be the number of dresses Ana has. Lisa has 18 more dresses than Ana, so Lisa has d + 18 dresses. The number of dresses they combined is 48. So we can write an equation: d + 18 + d = 48. We can solve for d by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation: d + 18 + d = 48 - 18 = d. d = 30. So, Ana has 30 dresses.
