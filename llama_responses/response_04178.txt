Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. John takes 1 year to get acclimated back to school life.
2. He then spends 2 years learning the basics of his field.
3. He spends 75% more time on research than he did learning the basics, so let's calculate the time spent on research: 2 years (basics) * 1.75 = 3.5 years.
4. He spends half as long on writing his dissertation as his acclimation period, which is 1 year. So, he spends 1/2 * 1 = 0.5 years on writing his dissertation.

Adding up all the time, we get: 1 + 2 + 3.5 + 0.5 = 6.5 years.
