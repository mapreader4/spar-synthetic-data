Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of money Mike needs to buy the phone. The cost of the phone is $1300. Since Mike already has 40% of the amount he needs, we need to find 100% of the amount he needs.

100% - 40% = 100% - 40% = 60%

So, Mike needs 60% of the amount he needs.

To find the amount of money Mike needs, we multiply 60% by the cost of the phone.

60% * 1300 = 0.6 * 1300 = 780

So, Mike needs 780 more dollars to buy the phone.
