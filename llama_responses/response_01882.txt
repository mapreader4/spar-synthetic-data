Let's start by letting x be the initial number of bananas on the tree. We know that Raj has eaten 70 bananas and has twice as many remaining in his basket. So, if we let x be the initial number of bananas on the tree, we can set up the equation:

x - 70 = 2 * (x - 70)

We can solve for x by adding 70 to both sides of the equation, which gives us:

x - 70 + 70 = 2 * x - 70 + 70

Then, we can subtract 70 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 140

So, there were 140 bananas on the tree initially.
