Let's break this problem down step by step.

Julie has already saved $1500. She plans to earn more money by mowing 20 lawns, delivering 600 newspapers, and walking 24 dogs.

For mowing 20 lawns, she will earn 20 x $20 = $400.

For delivering 600 newspapers, she will earn 600 x $0.40 = $240.

For walking 24 dogs, she will earn 24 x $15 = $360.

In total, Julie will earn $400 + $240 + $360 = $1000.

Adding this to the $1500 she already has, Julie will have a total of $1500 + $1000 = $2500.

Since the mountain bike costs $2345, Julie will have $2500 - $2345 = $155 left after purchasing the bike.

Answer: 155
