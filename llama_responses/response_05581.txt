Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's find the total number of students who wear vision assistance. 25% of the students wear glasses, which is 25/100 of the total students. 40% of the students wear contact lenses, which is 40/100 of the total students. 

To find the total number of students who wear vision assistance, we add the number of students who wear glasses and the number of students who wear contact lenses. 25/100 + 40/100 = 65/100. 

Now, to find the number of students who do not wear any vision assistance, we subtract the total number of students who wear vision assistance from the total number of students. 100 - 65 = 35.

Answer: 35
