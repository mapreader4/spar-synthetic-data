Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: "John has five more roommates than twice as many as Bob." 

Let's say the number of Bob's roommates is x. 

We know that John has five more roommates than twice the number of Bob's roommates, so the number of John's roommates is 2x.

We are given that Bob has 10 roommates. 

So, we can write the equation as 2x = 10.

We can solve for x, the number of Bob's roommates, by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

x = 10 / 2 = 5

So, John has 5 roommates.
