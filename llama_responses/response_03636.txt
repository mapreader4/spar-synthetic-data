To solve this problem, I will break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the apartment: The cost of the apartment is $1,250 per month.  Since Janet wants to rent the apartment for 2 months, the total cost would be 2 x $1,250 = $2,500.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Janet needs to pay in advance: The landlord requires 2 months' rent in advance, which is 2 x $1,250 = $2,500.  This means Janet needs to pay $2,500 upfront.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Janet needs for the deposit: The landlord requires a deposit of $500.  This is a one-time payment.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Janet needs in total: To rent the apartment, Janet needs to pay $2,500 for the 2 months' rent and $500 for the deposit.  To find the total amount Janet needs, I will add the two amounts together: $2,500 + $500 = $3,000.
