Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what we know:

* 1 lemon provides 4 tablespoons of lemon juice.
* Jose needs 12 tablespoons of lemon juice to make a dozen (12) cupcakes.
* To make 3 dozen (3 x 12 = 36) cupcakes, Jose needs 3 times as much lemon juice as it takes to make a dozen (1 dozen = 12) cupcakes.

Let's calculate the number of lemons needed:

12 tablespoons of lemon juice needed for 1 dozen cupcakes = 1 lemon
12 tablespoons of lemon juice needed for 2 dozen cupcakes = 2 lemons
12 tablespoons of lemon juice needed for 3 dozen cupcakes = 3 lemons

Jose needs 3 times as much lemon juice as it takes to make 3 dozen cupcakes. So, he needs 3 x 1 = 3 lemons.

Answer: 3
