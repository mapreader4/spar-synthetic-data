To find the total time Marla spends on the errand, we can add up the time spent on each part of the errand.

Marla spends 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, so that is 20 minutes.
She then spends 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, which is 70 minutes.
Finally, she spends the same amount of time driving home, which is 70 minutes.

To find the total time, we add up the times:

20 + 70 + 70 = 160

Answer: 160
