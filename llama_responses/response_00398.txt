Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of going to the pool: 2.50 per person. Since 10 people are going, the total cost would be 2.50 * 10 = 25.

The total amount of money the girl has is 30. We need to subtract the cost of going to the pool from the total amount of money the girl has. So, we subtract 25 from 30. The answer is 5.

Answer: 5
