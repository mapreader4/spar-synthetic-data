Let's start by using the information given to us. We know that Grandpa had 36 tomatoes initially. Then, we know that he had 100 more tomatoes when he came back. So, we can find the difference between the two numbers. To do this, we subtract 36 from 100. This gives us:

100 - 36 = 64

So, 64 tomatoes grew in his absence.

Answer: 64
