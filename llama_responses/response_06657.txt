Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many 12-sided dice Mark has. Mark has a bag of 10 dice and 60% of them are 12 sided. To find this out, we can multiply 10 x 0.6 = 6.

Mark has 6 12-sided dice.

Next, let's find out how many 12-sided dice James has. James has a bag of 8 dice and 75% of them are 12 sided. To find this out, we can multiply 8 x 0.75 = 6.

James has 6 12-sided dice.

Now, we need to find out how many 12-sided dice the boys need in total. They need a total of 14 dice. Since Mark has 6 and James has 6, they already have 12 in total. So, they need 14 - 12 = 2 more 12-sided dice.
