Let's start by converting the height of the hare to feet. We know that there are 12 inches in a foot, so the hare is 14 inches / 12 = 1.17 feet tall.

Now, we know that the camel is 24 times taller than the hare, so we need to multiply the height of the hare by 24. 1.17 feet * 24 = 28.08 feet. So, the camel is 28.08 feet tall.
