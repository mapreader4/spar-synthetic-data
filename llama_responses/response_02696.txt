Let's start by identifying the variables:

* Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda.
* Amanda read a number of books, which we'll call x.
* Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, which is x / 2.
* Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read, which is 7x.
* Candice read 18 books.

We can write an equation to represent the information:

Candice read 3x = 18

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = 18 / 3
x = 6

Since Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read, which is 7x, we can substitute x for x:

Patricia read 7x = 7 * 6 = 42

Answer: 42
