Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton.
* Zara is 64 inches tall.
* Brixton is Zara's height.

So, Brixton is 64 + 8 = 72 inches tall.

Now, to find the average height of the four people, we add up the heights and divide by 4.

(64 + 64 + 72) / 4 = 200 / 4 = 50

Answer: 50
