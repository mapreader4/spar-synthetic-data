Let's start by letting the number of dogs be x. Since the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs, we can set up an equation: x - 20% * x = 160/2. To solve for x, we can first convert the percentage to a decimal: 20% = 0.2, so the equation becomes x - 0.2x = 80. To solve for x, we can add 0.2x to both sides of the equation and get x = 80/0.2 = 400. So, the number of dogs is 400. Since there are twice as many frogs as dogs, the number of frogs is 800. Finally, the total number of animals in the compound is the sum of the number of dogs and frogs: 400 + 800 = 1200.
