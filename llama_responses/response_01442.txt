Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many cards Jame can tear in total.

Jame can tear 30 cards at a time, and he tears cards 3 times a week. So, the total number of cards he tears in a week is:

30 cards/week * 3 weeks = 90 cards

Now, Jame buys 18 decks of cards. Each deck has 55 cards, so the total number of cards he has is:

55 cards/deck * 18 decks = 990 cards

Since Jame can tear 90 cards in a week, and he has 990 cards, we can divide the total number of cards by the number of cards he can tear in a week to find out how many weeks he can go:

990 cards / 90 cards/week = 11 weeks

So, Jame can go 11 weeks.
