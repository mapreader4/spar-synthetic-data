Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the pots: 3 pots for $20 each. The total cost of the pots is 3 x $20 = $60.

The total cost of the items Katerina purchased is $100. The cost of the pans is not mentioned, but we know that the cost of the pots is $60. So, we need to find the cost of 2 pans.

Let's say the cost of 1 pan is x. Then, the cost of 2 pans will be 2x. The total cost of the items is $100, so we can set up the equation:

60 + 2x = 100

To solve for x, we subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 40

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 40 / 2

x = 20

So, the cost of 1 pan is $20, and the cost of 2 pans is 2 x 20 = $40.
