Let's break this problem down step by step.

Kelly has 8 students and each student needs 3 pieces of construction paper. So, the total number of construction paper needed is 8 x 3 = 24.

She buys 6 bottles of glue, but then drops half of them down the storm drain, which means she has 3 bottles of glue left.

Kelly buys 5 more pieces of construction paper, which adds to the initial 24 pieces she had. So, the new total number of construction paper is 24 + 5 = 29.

The question asks how many supplies are left, but it's not clear what type of supplies are being referred to. If we assume that the supplies include the construction paper and glue, then we can say that Kelly has 29 pieces of construction paper and 3 bottles of glue left.
