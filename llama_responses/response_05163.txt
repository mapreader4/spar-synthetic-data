Let's start by identifying the amount of food eaten by the guinea pigs.

The first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food.

The second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, so it eats 2 x 2 = 4 cups of food.

The third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one, which means it eats 4 + 3 = 7 cups of food.

In total, the guinea pigs eat 2 + 4 + 7 = 13 cups of food.

Answer: 13
