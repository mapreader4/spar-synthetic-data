Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the first 40 questions, where John got 90% correct. 90% of 40 is 36.

Next, let's look at the next 40 questions, where John gets 95% correct. 95% of 40 is 38.

Now, let's add the number of correct answers from both parts. 36 + 38 = 74.

So, John got a total of 74 correct answers.

Answer: 74
