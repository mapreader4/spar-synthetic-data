Let us say the number of books Katy read in July was y. Then, the number of books she read in August will be y - 3. The total number of books Katy read during the summer is the sum of the books she read in June and August. The number of books she read in June is y, and the number of books she read in August is y - 3. The total number of books Katy read during the summer is y + (y - 3). The equation is y + (y - 3) = 8 + 2y - 3. We can solve this equation by adding 8 to both sides. The equation is 2y + y - 5 = 11. If we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, we get y + y = 11 + 5. The value of y is 4. So, the number of books Katy read during the summer is 8 + 2 * 4 - 3 = 11. Answer: 11.
