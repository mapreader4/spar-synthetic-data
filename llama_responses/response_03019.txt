Let's break it down step by step.

Janelle starts with 26 green marbles.

She buys 6 bags of blue marbles, with 10 marbles in each bag. So, she gets 6 x 10 = 60 blue marbles.

She gives away 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles. That's a total of 14 marbles.

So, Janelle is left with 26 - 14 = 12 green marbles and 60 - 14 = 46 blue marbles.

So, Janelle has 12 green marbles and 46 blue marbles.
