Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be the width of the lake. Since the boat travels the whole width of the lake at a speed of 10 MPH in 30 minutes, we can set up the equation:

Distance = Speed x Time

Let's convert the time from minutes to hours:

30 minutes = 0.5 hours

Now, substitute this into the equation:

Distance = 10 x 0.5

Distance = 5

So, the boat travels 5 miles to travel the whole width of the lake.

Now, let's think about the boat's speed as it travels across the length of the lake. It takes 2 hours to travel this distance, and we know that the speed is 10 MPH. So, we can set up the equation:

Distance = Speed x Time

Let's substitute the distance and time into the equation:

Distance = 10 x 2

Distance = 20

So, the boat travels 20 miles to travel across the length of the lake.

Now, we know that the lake is a square, so we can find the area by multiplying the length and width:

Area = Length x Width

Area = 20 x 5

Area = 100

Answer: 100
