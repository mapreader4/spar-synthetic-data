Let's break this down step by step:

1. John danced for 3 hours initially.
2. Then he took a 1-hour break.
3. After the break, John danced for another 5 hours.
4. James danced the whole time John was dancing and resting, which is 3 + 1 = 4 hours.
5. Then James danced another 1/3 of 4 hours, which is 4 * (1/3) = 4/3 = 1.33 hours.
6. So, James danced for 4 + 1.33 = 5.33 hours.

John danced for 3 + 5 = 8 hours.  So, their combined dancing time without including John's break time is 8 hours.

Answer: 8
