Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find the distance she takes to school. It takes her 150 steps. Since she goes back and forth, she takes 150 steps for the round trip.

So, she takes 150 steps going to school, and 150 steps going back. That means she takes 300 steps in total.

Since she does this for 5 days, she takes 300 steps in total for each day, and 300 * 5 = 1500 steps in total in 5 days.

Answer: 1500
