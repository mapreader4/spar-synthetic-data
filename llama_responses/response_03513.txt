Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: The original cost of fuel is $200.
Step 2: The fuel capacity is doubled, so the new capacity is now 2 x the original capacity, which is 2 x 200 = 400.
Step 3: The fuel price increased by 20%, so the new price is 200 + 0.2 x 200 = 200 + 40 = 240.
Step 4: To fill the new tank, James needs 400 units of fuel, and the cost is 240 per unit. So, the total cost is 400 x 240 = 96,000.
