Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many ounces of dog food the puppy needs in total. For the first 60 days, it needs 2 ounces per day, so for 60 days, it needs:

60 days x 2 ounces/day = 120 ounces

After the first 60 days, it needs 4 ounces per day, and it will need to eat this special food for another 300 days (1 year - 60 days). So, it needs:

300 days x 4 ounces/day = 1200 ounces

In total, the puppy needs:

120 ounces + 1200 ounces = 1320 ounces

Now, we need to convert this total amount of ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total ounces by 16:

1320 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 82.5 pounds

Since the special dog food is only sold in 5-pound bags, we can divide the total pounds needed by 5:

82.5 pounds / 5 pounds/bag = 16.5 bags

Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the family needs to buy:
