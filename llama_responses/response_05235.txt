Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total revenue Mr. Banks earned from his 8 investments. Since he received $500 from each investment, he earned a total of 8 x $500 = $4000.

Next, let's find the total revenue Ms. Elizabeth earned from her 5 investments. Since she received $900 from each investment, she earned a total of 5 x $900 = $4500.

To find the difference in revenue between Ms. Elizabeth and Mr. Banks, we need to subtract the total revenue Mr. Banks earned from his investments from the total revenue Ms. Elizabeth earned from her investments.

$4500 - $4000 = $1000

So, the answer is:

Answer: 1000
