Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the school buys the $40 software package. It covers 5 devices. Since the school has 50 devices, it would need to buy 10 packages to cover all the devices, which would cost 10 x $40 = $400.

Now, let's say the school buys the $60 software package. It covers 10 devices. Since the school has 50 devices, it would only need to buy 5 packages to cover all the devices, which would cost 5 x $60 = $300.

So, the school would save $400 - $300 = $100 by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package.
