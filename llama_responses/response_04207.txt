Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the amount of money Mitzel had in her allowance initially. Since she spent 35% of her allowance, that means she spent 35% of her allowance on something. To find the amount of money she had in her allowance, we can set up a proportion.

Let x be the amount of money Mitzel had in her allowance. Since she spent 35% of her allowance, we can set up the proportion as follows:

35/100 = x / 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the proportion by 100 to eliminate the fraction:

x = (35/100) * 100

x = 35

So, Mitzel had 35 dollars in her allowance. Now, we can find the amount of money she has left by subtracting the amount she spent from the total amount she had:

35 - 14 = 21

Mitzel has 21 dollars left in her allowance.
