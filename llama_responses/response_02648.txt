Let's start by identifying the ages of the three siblings.

Let's say the ages of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle are x, y, and z, respectively.

We know that the ratio of their ages is 4:3:7. This means that the ratio of x to y is 4:3, and the ratio of y to z is 7.

We can write this as a proportion:

x:y = 4:3
y:z = 7

We can simplify this proportion to get:

x = 4k and y = 3k and z = 7k, for some integer k.

We know that the total age of the three siblings is 126. We can set up an equation using the sum of the three ages:

x + y + z = 126

Substituting the expressions for x, y, and z, we get:

4k + 3k + 7k = 126

Combine like terms:

11k = 126

Divide both sides by 11:

k = 11

Now we know that k = 11. We can substitute back into the expressions for x, y, and z:

x = 4k = 4(11) = 44
y = 3k = 3(11) = 33
z = 7k = 7(11) = 77

The age difference between Halima and Beckham is the difference between y and x:

y - x = 33 - 44 = -11

So, the age difference between Halima and Beckham is 11 years.
