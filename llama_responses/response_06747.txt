Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance of the daily commute:

The distance of the commute is 21 miles one way, so the total distance for a round trip is 2 x 21 = 42 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of gas consumed per day:

The car gets 30 miles/gallon, so the amount of gas consumed per day is 42 miles / 30 miles/gallon = 1.4 gallons.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of gas consumed per week:

The carpool commutes 5 days a week, so the total amount of gas consumed per week is 5 x 1.4 = 7 gallons.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of gas consumed per month:

The carpool commutes 4 weeks a month, so the total amount of gas consumed per month is 7 gallons x 4 = 28 gallons.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the gas consumed per person:

The cost of gas is $2.50/gallon, so the total cost of the gas consumed is 28 gallons x $2.50/gallon = $70.

Step 6: Calculate the cost per person:

The cost of the gas is split equally among the 5 people in the carpool, so the cost per person is $70 / 5 = $14.
