Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

We know that Mandy is 3 years old. We also know that her brother is 4 times as old as she is, so her brother is 3 x 4 = 12 years old.

We also know that Mandy's sister is 5 years younger than her brother, which means that her age is 12 - 5 = 7.

So, the age difference between Mandy and her sister is 7 - 3 = 4.

Answer: 4
