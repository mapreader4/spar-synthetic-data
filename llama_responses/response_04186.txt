Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first calculate the total value of items inside the loot boxes.

The average value of items inside each loot box is $3.5, so the total value of items in 40 loot boxes will be:

3.5 x 40 = 140

John spends $40 on loot boxes, so the total amount he spent is $40.

To find the average amount he lost, we need to subtract the total value of items inside the loot boxes from the total amount he spent.

140 - 40 = 100

So, the answer is:

Answer: 100
