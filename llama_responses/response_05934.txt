Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of students in each class:

* Ms. Cole's fourth-level math class: x
* Ms. Cole's sixth-level math class: 40
* Ms. Cole's seventh-level math class: 2x

Since there are four times as many students in the sixth-level math class as in the fourth-level math class, we can set up the equation:

x = 40 / 4

To solve for x, we can divide 40 by 4:

x = 40 / 4
x = 10

So, Ms. Cole's fourth-level math class has 10 students.

Now, the number of students in the seventh-level math class is twice that of the fourth-level math class:

2x = 2 * 10
2x = 20

So, Ms. Cole's seventh-level math class has 20 students.

To find the total number of math students Ms. Cole teaches, we add the number of students in all three classes:

10 (fourth-level) + 40 (sixth-level) + 20 (seventh-level) = 70

Answer: 70
