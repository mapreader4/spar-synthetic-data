Let's break this problem down step by step.

Harold makes $2500.00 a month from his job.

His rent is $700.00, so we subtract that from his income:

$2500.00 - $700.00 = $1800.00

He has a car payment of $300.00, and his utilities cost 1/2 the amount of his car payment, so we calculate that as follows:

$300.00 / 2 = $150.00

So, his utilities cost $150.00. Now, we subtract that from his remaining income:

$1800.00 - $150.00 = $1650.00

He spends $50.00 on groceries, so we subtract that from his remaining income:

$1650.00 - $50.00 = $1600.00

He wants to put half of the remaining money into a retirement account, so we take half of $1600.00:

$1600.00 / 2 = $800.00

So, the money left over for Harold is:

$1600.00 - $800.00 = $800.00

Answer: $800.00
