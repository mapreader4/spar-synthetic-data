Let's start by letting x be Jude's current age.

Since Heath will be 3 times as old as Jude in 5 years, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Heath's current age + 5 = 3 * Jude's current age

We know Heath's current age is 16, so we can substitute that in for Heath's current age.

16 + 5 = 3 * x

Now, we can solve for Jude's current age:

x = (16 + 5) / 3

x = 7

So, Jude is 7 years old today.
