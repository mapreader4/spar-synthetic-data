Let's break this down step by step.

Mike gets 100 dollars a week.  He decides to spend half of that at an arcade.  So he will spend 100 / 2 = 50 dollars at the arcade.

He spends 10 dollars at the arcade on food, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 dollars left.

He can play for 1 hour for 8 dollars, so he can play 40 / 8 = 5 hours.

So, he can play for 5 hours.

Answer: 5
