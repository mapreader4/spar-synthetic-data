Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that Melina is 3 times as old as Alma, so if Melina is 60, Alma must be 20.

Next, we know that the sum of their ages is twice the total number of points Alma scored in a test. Let's represent the total number of points Alma scored as x.

We know that Alma's age is 20 and Melina's age is 60. So, the sum of their ages is 20 + 60 = 80.

We know that this sum is equal to twice the total number of points Alma scored in the test. So, we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, Alma scored 40 points in the test.

Answer: 40
