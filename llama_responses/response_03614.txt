Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Robin walks from his house to the city center, which is 500 meters. So, he walks 500 meters.

Step 2: He realizes he forgot his bag and returns to his house, which means he walks back the 200 meters he initially walked, so he walks 200 meters back.

Step 3: Then, he goes back to the city center, which is 500 meters away from his house. So, he walks 500 meters again.

In total, Robin walks 500 + 200 + 500 = 1200 meters.

Answer: 1200
