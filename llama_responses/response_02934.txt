Let's break it down step by step:

Mary has 8 screws initially. She needs 2 more, so she needs a total of 8 + 2 = 10 screws.

She has to split the 10 screws into 4 sections. To do this, we can divide 10 by 4, which gives us:

10 รท 4 = 2.5

Since you can't divide screws into fractions, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, each pile will have:

2 screws.

Answer: 2
