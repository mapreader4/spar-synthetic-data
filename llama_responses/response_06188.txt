Let's break down Dino's income and expenses step by step:

1. Dino works 20 hours a month making $10 an hour, so his income from this job is:

20 hours x $10 per hour = $200

2. Dino works 30 hours a month making $20 an hour, so his income from this job is:

30 hours x $20 per hour = $600

3. Dino works 5 hours a month making $40 an hour, so his income from this job is:

5 hours x $40 per hour = $200

4. Total income: $200 + $600 + $200 = $1000

5. Dino pays $500 in expenses, so his total expenses are:

$500

6. To find out how much money Dino has left at the end of the month, we subtract his expenses from his total income:

$1000 - $500 = $500

Answer: 500
