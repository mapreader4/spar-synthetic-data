Let's start by using the information given in the problem to set up an equation. We know that James owns $40 more than Ali. So, we can set up the equation as:

James' amount = Ali's amount + 40.

Let's say Ali's amount is x. Then, James' amount is x + 40.

The total amount owned by James and Ali together is $250. So, we can set up the equation as:

x + (x + 40) = 250.

We can combine the like terms on the left side of the equation:

x + x + 40 = 250.

We can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation to get:

x + x = 210.

Subtract 210 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 210 - 210.

x = 0.

So, the answer is: Answer: 0.
