Let's start by identifying the total number of fish at the reception. There are 2 fish in the fishbowl, and 3 fish at the one table that has 3 fish. So, there are 2 + 3 = 5 fish at the centerpieces. Since there are 32 tables, and each table has the same number of fish, we can divide 5 fish by 32 to find the total number of fish at the reception. 5 / 32 = 0.15625. But since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 0. So, there are 0 fish at the reception.
