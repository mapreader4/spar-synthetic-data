Let's start by identifying the total amount of money used by Mrs. Brown to pay her utility bills. The problem states that she used 3 $50 bills and 2 $10 bills. To find the total amount, we need to add the values of the bills:

3 $50 bills = 3 x 50 = 150
2 $10 bills = 2 x 10 = 20

Adding these values together, we get:
150 + 20 = 170

So, the total amount Mrs. Brown paid for her utility bills is $170.
