Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Archie started with x marbles.

He loses 60% of them, so he loses 0.6x.

Then, he loses half of the remaining marbles, which is 0.5(0.4x). So, the number of marbles left is 0.4x.

Since he has 20 left, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

0.4x = 20

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 20 / 0.4
x = 50

So, Archie started with 50 marbles.
