Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of hiring the first employee who works for $20 an hour.

Cost of hiring the first employee = 20 * 40 = 800 dollars per week

Step 2: Calculate the cost of hiring the second employee, including the government subsidy.

Cost of hiring the second employee = 22 * 40 + 6 * 40 = 868 dollars per week

Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between the two employees.

Difference in cost = 868 - 800 = 68 dollars per week

Answer: 68
