Let's break this down step by step.

1. Frank's detergent is double concentrated, so it can wash 80 loads of laundry with one bottle.
2. The cost of one bottle is $25.00, so the cost per load is $25.00 / 80 = $0.3125 per load.
3. If he buys 2 bottles, the cost is $20.00 per bottle, so the total cost is 2 x $20.00 = $40.00.
4. The total cost for 80 loads of laundry is 80 x $0.3125 = $25.00.
5. To find the cost per load, we subtract the total cost of the detergent from the total cost of the detergent: $40.00 - $25.00 = $15.00.
6. The cost per load is $15.00 / 80 = $0.1875.
