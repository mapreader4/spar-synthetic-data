Let's start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Samuel swept the porch and cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from it. So, the number of dust particles that were on the porch before Samuel swept is 9/10 of the total dust particles. The total number of dust particles is given as 331. So, to find the number of dust particles before Samuel swept, we need to multiply 331 by 9/10:

331 * 9/10 = 299.1

So, the answer is: Answer: 299.
