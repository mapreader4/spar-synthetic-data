Let's break down the drink into its components. The drink has 2 parts Coke and 1 part Sprite, so the total volume of the Coke is 2/3 of the total volume of the drink. Since the total volume of the drink is 6 ounces, we can set up an equation to solve for the volume of Coke. Let's say x is the volume of Coke, then the equation would be:

2x = 6

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us:

x = 6/2
x = 3

So, the volume of Coke is 3 ounces.
