Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Rocky is selling jewelry at $30 each, and he increases the price by $10 each, so the new price of jewelry is $40 each.

The price of paintings is $100 each, and he increases it by 20%, which is 20% of $100, which is $20. So, the new price of paintings is $120 each.

A buyer buys 2 pieces of jewelry at $40 each and 5 paintings at $120 each. The total cost of jewelry is 2 x $40 = $80. The total cost of paintings is 5 x $120 = $600. The total amount the buyer has to pay is $80 + $600 = $680.

Answer: 680
