Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the total cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $10 = $30.
2. There's a 10% discount on the total cost for people who purchase 3 or more pairs at once. So, the discount is 10% of $30, which is $3.
3. So, the total cost of 3 pairs of shorts with the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.
4. If Stacy were to buy the shorts individually at different times, the total cost would be 3 x $10 = $30.
5. To find the difference between the total cost with the discount and the total cost without the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost with the discount: $30 - $3 = $27.
6. The difference is $3.
