Let's break down the information given:

* The boat capsized, so the sheep and cows went into the water.
* The problem states that 3 sheep drowned, and 2 times the number of cows that drowned is 3, so the number of cows that drowned is 6.
* The problem states that all of the dogs made it to shore, so the number of dogs that made it to the shore is 14.

So, the total number of animals that made it to the shore is the sum of the number of sheep, cows, and dogs: 20 + 6 + 14 = 40.
