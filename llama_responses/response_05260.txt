Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's calculate Celia's total weekly food budget for the month:

$100 per week × 4 weeks = $400

Next, let's calculate her total monthly expenses:

$1500 (rent) + $30 (video streaming services) + $50 (cell phone usage) = $1580

Now, let's add her weekly food budget to her monthly expenses:

$400 (weekly food budget) + $1580 (monthly expenses) = $1980

Celia wants to set aside 10% of her total spending for the month. To find 10% of $1980, we can multiply $1980 by 0.10:

$1980 × 0.10 = $198

Answer: 198
