Let's start by letting x be the number of students who ordered burgers. Since the number of students who ordered burgers was 30, and the number of students who ordered hot dogs was twice the number of students who ordered burgers, we can set up the equation 30 = 2x. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us x = 15. This means that 15 students ordered burgers.
