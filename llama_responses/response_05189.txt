Let's break this down step by step.

Mary ran the first leg and took twice as long as Susan. Let's call Susan's time "x". Then Mary's time would be 2x.

Susan ran the second leg and took 10 seconds longer than Jen. Jen's time is given as 30 seconds, so Susan's time would be 30 + 10 = 40 seconds. Since Susan's time is x, we can set up an equation:

x + 10 = 40

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

x = 30

So Susan's time is 30 seconds. Mary's time is twice that, which is:

2x = 2(30) = 60

Jen's time is 30 seconds, and Tiffany's time is 7 seconds less than Mary's, so:

Tiffany's time = 60 - 7 = 53

Now we have the times for each leg:

Mary: 60
Susan: 30
Jen: 30
Tiffany: 53

To find the total time, we add up the times:

60 + 30 + 30 + 53 = 173

Answer: 173
