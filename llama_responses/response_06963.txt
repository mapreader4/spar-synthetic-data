Let's break it down step by step.

Leila bought apples for 5€, which means she spent 5€. She bought sugar for 3€, which is another 3€. She bought carrots for 17€, which is another 17€. In total, she spent 5 + 3 + 17 = 25€. She paid with a 50€ bill, which is 50€. So, the change is 50 - 25 = 25€. So, the saleswoman returns 25€ to Leila.
