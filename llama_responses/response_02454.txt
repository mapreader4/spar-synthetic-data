Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of students wearing striped shirts is x.

The number of students wearing checkered shirts is 2/3 of the total number of students, which is 81.

The number of students wearing shorts is x + 19.

The number of students wearing striped shirts is the difference between the total number of students and the number of students wearing shorts, which is 81 - (x + 19).

The problem statement says that 19 more students are wearing checkered shirts than striped shirts. So, the number of students wearing striped shirts is x - (x + 19).

The number of students wearing striped shirts is x - (x + 19) = 19.

x - (x + 19) = 19

x - x = 38

x = 38 + x

So, the number of students wearing striped shirts is 38.

Answer: 38
