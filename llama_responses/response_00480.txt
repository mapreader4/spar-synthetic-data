Let's break this down step by step.

Kirt's monthly salary is $6000. If his salary increases by 30% after a year, we can calculate the new salary by multiplying his original salary by 1.3 (1 + 0.3).

$6000 * 1.3 = $7800

So, Kirt's new salary is $7800.

After 3 years, Kirt will have worked for 36 months. If his salary is $7800 per month, his total earnings would be:

$7800 * 36 = $280800

Answer: 280800
