Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Will was 4 years old 3 years ago. This means that Will is 7 years old now.

Diane is twice as old as Will, so Diane is 14 years old.

Now, we are asked to find the sum of their ages in 5 years.

To do this, we need to add 5 years to their current ages. For Will, this will be 7 + 5 = 12. For Diane, this will be 14 + 5 = 19.

So, the sum of their ages in 5 years will be 12 + 19 = 31.

Answer: 31
