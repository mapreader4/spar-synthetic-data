Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that the total amount spent is $2050. We know that the cost of a keyboard is unknown, but we can represent this as a variable. Let's call it "k".

We know that the cost of a printer is also unknown, and we can represent this as another variable, which we can call "p".

We know that the total cost of the 15 keyboards and 25 printers is $2050. We can set up an equation to represent this information:

15k + 25p = 2050

We want to find the cost of a printer, so we can solve for "p". We can do this by subtracting the cost of the keyboards from the total cost:

p = 2050 - 15 * 20

First, let's multiply the cost of the keyboards by 15:

15 * 20 = 300

Now, let's subtract the result from the total cost:

2050 - 300 = 1750

So, the cost of a printer is 1750.
