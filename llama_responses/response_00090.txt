Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many days are in each month.

December has 31 days.
January has 31 days.
February has 28 days.

Total number of days in the 3 months = 31 + 31 + 28 = 90 days.

Now, let's find out how many cups Herman needs for each day.

For each day, Herman feeds the birds 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon, so that's a total of 1 cup per day.

For all 90 days, Herman will need 1 cup x 90 = 90 cups of food.

Answer: 90
