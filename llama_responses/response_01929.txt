Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. Lori owns 15 times as many beanie babies as Sydney. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information.

Let x be the number of beanie babies Sydney has. Then, we can write the equation as 15x = 300.

Now, we can solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15.

x = 300 / 15

x = 20

So, Sydney has 20 beanie babies. Since Lori owns 15 times as many beanie babies as Sydney, Lori has 15 x 20 beanie babies.

Answer: 300
