Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many phones were produced this year. Since a quarter of this year's production is sold, we can find this year's production by multiplying the quarter by 4.

This year's production is 4/4 of this year's production.

We know last year's production was 5000 phones, so this year's production is 5000 * 4 = 20000 phones.

Now, let's find how many phones are left in the factory. We can find this by subtracting the sold phones from the total production.

20000 - 1/4 * 20000 = 16000.

Answer: 16000
