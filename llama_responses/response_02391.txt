Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Lucas makes 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each of his students on Monday. So, if all of his students come to class, he will make 4 * 37 = 148 pieces of chocolate candy.

However, 3 of his students will not be coming to class, so we need to subtract those students from the total number of students. 37 (since 40 - 3 = 37) will be the number of students coming to class.

So, Lucas will make 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each of the 37 students coming to class. To find the total number of chocolate candies, we multiply 4 by 37, which is equal to 148.

Answer: 148
