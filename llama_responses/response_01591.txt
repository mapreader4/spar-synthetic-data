Let's first find the total number of balloons, which is 3414 + 1762 = 5176.

Now, we need to divide this by the number of schools, which is 10.

5176 รท 10 = 517.6

We can't divide the total number of balloons evenly among 10 schools, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, that would be 517.

So, each school will receive 517 balloons.
