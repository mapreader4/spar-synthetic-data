Let's break it down step by step:

Martha's cat catches 3 rats.
Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times as many animals as Martha's cat.
Let's calculate the number of animals caught by Cara's cat. If Martha's cat catches 3 rats, and Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times that, then we can write an equation to solve for the number of animals caught by Cara's cat:

Let x be the number of animals caught by Cara's cat. Then, we know that Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times as many animals as Martha's cat, which is 3, so we can write:

x = 3 - (5 * 3) = 0

x = 3 - 15 = -12

So, Cara's cat catches -12 animals.

Answer: -12
