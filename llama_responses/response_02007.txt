Let's start by using the information given: Merry has 10 lambs, and her brother has 3 more lambs than her. Let's let x be the number of lambs her brother has. Then, we can set up the equation:

10 + x = x + 3

We can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 3

So, her brother has 3 lambs. Now, we can add the number of lambs Merry has to the number of lambs her brother has to find the total number of lambs. That would be:

10 + 3 = 13

Answer: 13
