Let's break it down step by step:

1. Owen initially has 21 turtles.
2. Johanna has 5 fewer turtles than Owen, so she has 21 - 5 = 16 turtles.
3. After 1 month, Owen has twice as many turtles as before, which is 2 x 21 = 42.
4. Johanna loses half of her turtles and donates the rest to Owen, which is 16 / 2 = 8.
5. So, Owen now has 42 - 8 = 34 turtles.

Answer: 34
