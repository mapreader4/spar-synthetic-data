Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the meal after the coupon. The total cost of the meal is $67 and there is a $4 coupon. So, the total cost of the meal after the coupon is:

$67 - $4 = $63

Next, we need to divide the cost of the meal by the number of people. There are 3 people: Sarah, Mary, and Tuan. So, we divide the cost of the meal by 3:

$63 รท 3 = $21

So, each person needs to contribute $21 to the bill.
