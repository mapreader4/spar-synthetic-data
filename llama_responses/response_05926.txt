Let's start by converting the amount of euros to pounds. We know that 11 euros is equal to 11 x 2 = 22 pounds. So, Jack has 22 pounds.

Then, we can convert the amount of pounds to yen. We know that 1 pound is equal to 1000 yen. So, 22 pounds is equal to 22 x 1000 = 22000 yen.

So, the total amount of yen that Jack has is 22000 yen.
