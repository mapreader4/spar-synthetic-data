Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the distance between each buoy is x meters. Since the first buoy is at the beach, the distance from the beach to the first buoy is 0 meters.

Since the swimmer reaches the third buoy, they have swum out 72 meters. This means the distance between the first and the third buoy is 72 meters.

The distance between the buoys is the same, so the distance between each buoy is also 72 meters.

Since the fourth buoy is the fourth buoy, the distance from the beach to the fourth buoy is 3 times the distance between each buoy. So, the distance from the beach to the fourth buoy is 3 x 72 meters, which is 216 meters.

Answer: 216
