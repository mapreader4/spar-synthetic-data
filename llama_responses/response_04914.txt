Let's break down the tasks and their corresponding times:

1. Finish homework: 30 minutes
2. Clean room: Half as long as homework, so 30/2 = 15 minutes
3. Walk the dog: 5 minutes more than homework, so 30 + 5 = 35 minutes
4. Take out the trash: 1/6 of the time it takes to do the homework, so 30/6 = 5 minutes

Add up the times for all the tasks:

30 + 15 + 35 + 5 = 85 minutes

Janice needs 2 hours (120 minutes) to watch the movie. She needs to finish these tasks before leaving, so let's subtract the total time for the tasks from the total time available:

120 - 85 = 35 minutes

So, Janice has 35 minutes left before the movie starts.

Answer: 35
