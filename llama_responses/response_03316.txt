Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many candies Shelly's friend had. Since Shelly's friend brought twice as much candy as she originally had, and she brought half of that, she must have brought 20 candies. 20 candies were already in the bowl, so the total number of candies is 20 + 20 = 40.

Then, Shelly and her friend eat 10 candies. This means that Shelly's friend has 40 - 10 = 30 candies left.

So, the answer is: Answer: 30.
