Let's break down the problem step by step.

Palmer started with 100 photos in her album.

In the first week, she took 50 new pictures, so her total number of photos becomes:
100 + 50 = 150

In the second week, she took twice as many pictures as in the first week, which is 2 x 50 = 100. So, her total number of photos becomes:
150 + 100 = 250

In the third and fourth weeks, she took a total of 80 new photos. So, her total number of photos becomes:
250 + 80 = 330

Now, let's add the 330 photos she took in Bali to her original 100 photos. Her new total number of photos is:
330 + 100 = 430

Answer: 430
