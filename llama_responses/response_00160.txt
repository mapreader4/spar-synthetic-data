Let's break it down step by step.

John splits the cost of the party with 3 other people. So, we can divide the cost of everything by 4 people.

Cost of burgers: 100 pounds * $3 per pound = $300
Cost of condiments and propane: $80
Cost of alcohol: $200

Total cost: $300 + $80 + $200 = $480

Answer: 480
