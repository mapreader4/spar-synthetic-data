Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The area of each slab of concrete is 100 feet by 100 feet, which is 10,000 square feet.
2. The thickness of the slab is.5 feet, which is 0.5 feet, so the volume of the slab is 10,000 square feet * 0.5 feet, which is 5,000 cubic feet.
3. The density of the concrete is 150 pounds per cubic foot, so the weight of the slab is 5,000 cubic feet * 150 pounds per cubic foot, which is 750,000 pounds.
4. The cost of the concrete is $0.02 per pound, so the cost of the slab is 750,000 pounds * $0.02 per pound, which is $15,000.

Answer: 15000
