Let's break down the cost of the items that Mary and Rose bought.

Mary bought 2 pairs of sunglasses for $50 each, so that is $100. She also bought a pair of jeans for $100. So, she spent $100 for the jeans and $100 for the sunglasses. So, she spent $200 in total.

Rose bought a pair of shoes for $150 and two decks of basketball cards. The cost of the shoes is $150. So, the cost of the shoes is already accounted for. The cost of the two decks of basketball cards is unknown. Let's call it x. The total amount spent by Rose is $150 for the shoes and $x for the cards. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

The total amount spent by Mary and Rose is $200. We know that the cost of the jeans and the sunglasses is $200. So, the cost of the shoes and the cards must be $200 - $200. We can set up the equation as:

$150 + x = $200 - $200

To solve for x, we need to subtract $200 from both sides of the equation. This will give us:

$150 - $200 = $50

So, x = $50. The cost of one deck of basketball cards is $50.
