To find the total time Jane spends waiting for her nail polish to dry, we need to add up the time it takes for each coat of polish to dry.

The base coat takes 2 minutes to dry. The two color coats take 3 minutes each to dry, so that is 2 + 3 = 5 minutes. The clear top coat takes 5 minutes to dry.

Adding these up, we get 2 + 5 + 5 = 12 minutes.

Answer: 12
