Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding out how many liters of water Ivy drinks in 1 day. Ivy drinks 2.5 liters of water each day, so in 1 day, she drinks 2.5 liters of water. Since the problem is asking about 4 days, we need to multiply the daily amount of water by 4 to find the total amount of water needed for 4 days.

2.5 liters * 4 = 10 liters

So, Ivy should buy 10 liters of water for her 4 days consumption.
