Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know that Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20.

Let's say Jayden's number is x. Then, Mickey's number is x + 20.

We also know that Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number. So, Coraline's number is x + 40.

We know that Coraline's number is 80.

We can set up an equation to represent this information:

x + 40 = 80

We can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 40

Now we know that Jayden's number is 40.

We can now find Mickey's number by adding 20 to Jayden's number:

Mickey's number = Jayden's number + 20
= 40 + 20
= 60

So, the total of the numbers they have is:

Jayden's number + Mickey's number
= 40 + 60
= 100

Answer: 100
