Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the ratio of oil to peanuts. The ratio is 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts. Let's denote the number of ounces of oil used as x.

The total number of ounces of peanuts is 20. The ratio is 2:8, so we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of oil used.

We can set up the equation as 20 = 8x. We can then solve for x by dividing both sides by 8.

20 รท 8 = x
x = 2.5

So, Sonja used 2.5 ounces of oil.
