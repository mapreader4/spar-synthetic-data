Let's break it down step by step.

Draymond earned 12 points.
Kelly earned 2 times as Draymond, so Kelly earned 2 * 12 = 24 points.
Durant earned 2 times the points as Kelly, so Durant earned 2 * 9 = 18 points.
Klay earned half the points as Draymond, so Klay earned (1/2) * 12 = 6 points.

In total, the Golden State Team had 12 + 24 + 18 + 6 = 60 points.
