Let's start by using the information given. Tilly needs to make a profit of $300, and she sells each bag for $10. So, to find the cost of each bag, we can set up an equation:

Let's say the cost of each bag is x. Then, we know that Tilly makes a profit of $300 by selling 100 bags at $10 each. So, we can set up the equation:

100 x 10 = 300 + x

To solve for the cost of each bag, we can subtract $300 from both sides of the equation:

100 x 10 = 300 - 300
100 x 10 = 0

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 0

So, Tilly bought each bag for $0.
