To find the total amount of money Stan pays the magician, we need to multiply the number of hours the magician works by the hourly rate.

The magician works 3 hours every day for 2 weeks, which is 3 * 14 = 42 hours in total.  Since the hourly rate is $60, we multiply 42 hours by $60 to get the total amount: 42 * 60 = 2520.

Answer: 2520
