Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that the price of the TV is $1700. The tax is 15% of the value-added tax. We need to find 15% of the value-added tax.

To find 15% of the value-added tax, we need to find 15% of the value-added tax. To do this, we can multiply the value-added tax by 15. Let's assume the value-added tax is x. Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

15% of the value-added tax = 15 * x

Next, we know that the value-added tax is equal to the value-added tax. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

15 * x = 15 * (value-added tax)

Since we know the value-added tax is the total tax, which is the total tax. So, we can replace the value-added tax with the total tax.

15 * x = 15 * 0

We can now solve for x, the value-added tax. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15.

x = 0

So, the value-added tax is 0. Since we know the value-added tax is the total tax, we can conclude that the value-added tax is 0.

So, the price of the television when calculating 15% of the value-added tax is $0.
