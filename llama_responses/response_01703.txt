Let's break it down step by step.

Coach A bought 10 basketballs for $29 each, so the total amount coach A spent on basketballs is 10 x $29 = $290.

Coach B bought 14 baseballs for $2.50 each, so the total amount coach B spent on baseballs is 14 x $2.50 = $35. Coach B also bought a baseball bat for $18.

To find the total amount coach B spent, we add the cost of the baseballs and the baseball bat: $35 + $18 = $53.

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount coach A spent and the amount coach B spent. To do this, we subtract the amount coach B spent from the amount coach A spent: $290 - $53 = $237.

So, coach A spent $237 more than coach B.
