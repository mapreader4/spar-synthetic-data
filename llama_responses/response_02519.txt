Let's think step by step.

Lee has 15 dollars initially. He wants to buy a 90 dollar pair of sneakers, so he needs 90 - 15 = 75 more dollars.

He plans to sell his action figures to make the rest. He sells 10 action figures and has 25 dollars left after buying the sneakers. 

Let's call the amount he charges per action figure x.

The equation is 75 = 10x + 25. We can solve for x.

75 = 10x + 25

Subtract 25 from both sides of the equation to get:

75 - 25 = 10x

50 = 10x

Now, divide both sides by 10 to get:

5 = x

Answer: 5
