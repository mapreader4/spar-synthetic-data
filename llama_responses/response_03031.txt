Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of fish that Jerk Tuna has. According to the problem, Jerk Tuna has one hundred forty-four fish.

Now, Tall Tuna has twice as many fish as Jerk Tuna. So, we can multiply the number of fish that Jerk Tuna has by 2 to find the number of fish that Tall Tuna has. One hundred forty-four times two is two hundred eighty-eight.

So, the number of fish that Tall Tuna has is two hundred eighty-eight.
