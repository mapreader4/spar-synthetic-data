Let's start by finding out how much money Sophie has left after buying the initial 2 shirts and the pair of trousers.

The cost of the 2 shirts is 2 x 18.50 = 37.00
The cost of the pair of trousers is 63.00
The total cost of these items is 37.00 + 63.00 = 100.00
Sophie has 260.00 - 100.00 = 160.00 left.

She wants to buy 4 more items with the remaining budget, so we need to divide 160.00 by 4.

160.00 / 4 = 40.00

So each item would cost 40.00.
