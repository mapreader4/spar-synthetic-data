Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill introduces 12 spiders, which each eat 7 bugs. So, the initial 12 spiders will eat 12 * 7 = 84 bugs.
2. After the spiders eat the bugs, the total bug population will be 400 - 84 = 316.
3. Then, Bill sprays the garden, which reduces the bug population to 80% of what it was previously, which is 316. To find 80% of 316, we multiply 316 by 0.8, which is 251.2.
4. So, there are 251.2 bugs left.

Answer: 251.2
