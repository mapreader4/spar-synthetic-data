Let's break down the information given:

1. Roger has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined.
2. Roger's retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience.
3. Peter said that when he came to the company, his daughter was 7 years old, and now she is 19 years old. This means Peter has been working for 12 years (19 - 7 = 12).
4. Tom has twice as many years of experience as Robert.
5. Robert has 4 years of experience less than Peter, but 2 more years of experience than Mike.
6. Since Peter has been working for 12 years, Robert has 12 - 4 = 8 years of experience.
7. Since Robert has 2 more years of experience than Mike, Mike has 8 - 2 = 6 years of experience.

Now, let's find the total experience of the four coworkers:

Peter: 12 years
Robert: 8 years
Tom: 2 * 8 = 16 years (since Tom has twice as many years of experience as Robert)
Mike: 6 years

Total experience of the four coworkers: 12 + 8 + 16 + 6 = 42 years

Since Roger has the same amount of experience as the four coworkers combined, Roger has 42 years of experience.

To find out how many more years Roger has to work before he retires, we subtract his current experience from the total experience needed for retirement:

50 (years needed for retirement) - 42 (current experience) = 8 years

Answer: 8
