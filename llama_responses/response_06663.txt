Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the speed of the horse and the speed of the bullet when they are moving in the same direction.

The speed of the horse is 20 feet per second.

The speed of the bullet is 400 feet per second.

Since they are moving in the same direction, we can add their speeds together to find the combined speed:

20 feet per second (horse) + 400 feet per second (bullet) = 420 feet per second

Now, let's find the speed of the bullet when it's fired in the opposite direction of the horse's movement.

The horse is running at 20 feet per second, so the bullet would be moving in the opposite direction at 20 feet per second.

The bullet is fired at a speed of 400 feet per second, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, we subtract the horse's speed from the bullet's speed:

400 feet per second - 20 feet per second = 380 feet per second

So, the bullet is moving at a speed of 380 feet per second when fired in the opposite direction of the horse's movement.

To find the difference in speed, we subtract the slower speed from the faster speed:

420 feet per second (same direction) - 380 feet per second (opposite direction) = 40 feet per second

Answer: 40
