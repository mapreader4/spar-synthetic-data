Let's break down the information given. We know that 4 tires and 1 battery together cost $224. We can say that the cost of 4 tires is $x. Then, the cost of 1 battery is $224 - x. Since we know that 4 tires cost $x, we can set up the equation 4x = 224. Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 4. 4x = 224 / 4 = 56. So, the cost of 1 battery is $56.
