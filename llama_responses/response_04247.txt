Let's start by finding the total number of seconds of video footage Patricia has.

The total number of seconds is:

130 + 145 + 85 + 60 + 180 = 500

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can divide the total number of seconds by 60 to find the total number of minutes:

500 รท 60 = 8.33

Since the problem is asking for the average number of minutes each player gets, we can divide the total number of minutes by the number of players, which is 4:

8.33 รท 4 = 2.083

So, on average, each player gets 2.083 minutes of video footage.
