Let's break this problem down step by step.

Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each, so she made a total of 40 x $0.8 = $32. She sold 30 cupcakes for $2 each, so she made a total of 30 x $2 = $60. 

Total money made by selling cookies and cupcakes = $32 + $60 = $92.

She spent $6.5 on 2 sets of measuring spoons. So, she spent $6.5.

To find the money she has left, we subtract the money she spent from the total money she made:

$92 - $6.5 = $85.5

Answer: 85.5
