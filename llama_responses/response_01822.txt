Let's break this down step by step.

On the first day, the ship travels 100 miles north.

On the second day, it travels three times the distance of the first day, which is 100 miles. So, it travels 3 x 100 = 300 miles.

On the third day, it travels 110 miles more than the distance it covered on the second day, which is 300 miles. So, it travels 300 + 110 = 410 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the distances traveled each day:

100 + 300 + 410 = 810

Answer: 810
