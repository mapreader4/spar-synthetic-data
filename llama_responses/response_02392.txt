Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the computer parts is $800.
2. John sells the computers for 1.4 times the value of the components, so the selling price is $800 x 1.4 = $1120.
3. He makes a profit of $1120 - $800 = $320 per computer.
4. He builds 60 computers a month, so his total profit from building and selling the computers is 60 x $320 = $19200.
5. He has to pay $5000 a month in rent and another $3000 in non-rent extra expenses, so his total monthly expenses are $5000 + $3000 = $8000.
6. To find his monthly profit, we subtract his total expenses from his total revenue: $19200 - $8000 = $11200.

Answer: 11200
