Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of the chocolates. Romeos buys 5 bars of chocolate at $5 each, so the total cost of the chocolates is 5 x 5 = 25 dollars.

Then, Romeo uses packaging material that costs him 2 dollars for each bar of chocolate. So, the total cost of the packaging material is 5 x 2 = 10 dollars.

The total amount of money Romeo makes is the total revenue he gets from selling the chocolates minus the cost of the packaging material. So, the total revenue is 90 - 10 = 80 dollars.

So, Romeo makes a profit of 80 dollars.
