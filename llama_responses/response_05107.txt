Let's start by letting x be the original borrowed amount.

The total amount borrowed is the sum of the original amount and the interest. We know that the total amount is $1500, so we can set up an equation:

x + 0.12x = 1500

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.12x from both sides of the equation:

x + 0.12x - 0.12x = 1500 - 0.12x
x = 1500

To isolate x, we can subtract 0.12x from both sides of the equation again:

x - 0.12x = 1500 - 0.12x
x = 1500 / 0.88
x = 1687.5

Answer: 1687
