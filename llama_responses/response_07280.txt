Let's break this problem down step by step!

We know that there are 4 brown stripes.

We also know that there are three times as many gold stripes as brown stripes, so the number of gold stripes is 4 x 3 = 12.

We know that there are five times as many blue stripes as gold stripes, so the number of blue stripes is 12 x 5 = 60.

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 60
