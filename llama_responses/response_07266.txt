Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that the jar of grape candy has 5 more pieces than the jar of banana candy. Let's call the number of pieces in the banana jar x.

The jar of grape candy has 5 more pieces than the jar of banana candy, so we can write an equation to represent this:

x + 5 = number of pieces in grape jar

We know that the jar of peanut butter candy has 4 times as much candy as the jar of grape candy. So, we can write another equation to represent this:

number of pieces in peanut butter jar = 4 × (x + 5)

We can now substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate the variable x:

number of pieces in peanut butter jar = 4 × (x + 5) = 4x + 20

Now, we know that the banana jar has 43 pieces. We can substitute this into the equation:

43 = 4x + 20

Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to get:

43 - 20 = 4x

Subtract 43 - 20 from both sides of the equation to get:

23 = 4x

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 23 ÷ 4

x = 5.75

The jar of peanut butter candy has 4 times as much candy as the jar of grape candy, so we can multiply 5.75 by 4 to get the number of pieces in the peanut butter jar:

5.75 × 4 = 23

Answer: 23
