Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Deborah is mailing 2 letters internationally.
* She is paying $4.60 to mail 4 letters.
* Standard postage is $1.08 per letter.

We can start by using the information about the standard postage. We know that 4 letters will cost 4 x $1.08 = $4.32. Since Deborah is paying $4.60 to mail 4 letters, that means the $4.60 must be the total cost of the international shipping, which is the additional charge.

To find the additional charge per letter, we can subtract the cost of the standard postage from the total cost:

$4.60 (total cost) - $4.32 (standard postage) = $0.28

Since Deborah is mailing 2 letters internationally, the additional charge per letter is:

$0.28 รท 2 = $0.14
