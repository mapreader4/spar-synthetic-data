Let's start by using the information given to set up an equation.

Let's say the cost of one pair of jeans for James is x.

Then, we know that the total cost of the items is $110, and that includes the cost of one pair of jeans, which is x, and the cost of the shoes for James, which is $30. We can set up an equation to represent the total cost:

x + 2x + 30 = 110

We can solve for x by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

x + 2x = 80

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1 to get:

x = 80 / 2

x = 40

So, the cost of one pair of jeans is $40.
