Let's break it down step by step.

James spends 3 hours vacuuming. That is the first part of his chores.

He also spends 3 times as long on the rest of his chores. "As long" means as long as, so we can say that he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours on the rest of his chores.

So, he spends a total of 3 + 9 = 12 hours on his chores.
