To find the number of hours Davida worked on Weeks 3 and 4, I will first find the total hours she worked in Weeks 3 and 4. Davida worked 48 hours each of Weeks 3 and 4, so she worked a total of 48 + 48 = 96 hours in those two weeks. To find the number of hours she worked in Weeks 1 and 2, I will subtract the total hours she worked in Weeks 1 and 2 from the total hours she worked in Weeks 3 and 4. Davida worked 35 hours in each of Weeks 1 and 2, so she worked a total of 35 + 35 = 70 hours in those two weeks. To find the difference, I will subtract the hours worked in Weeks 1 and 2 from the hours worked in Weeks 3 and 4, so 96 - 70 = 26. 

Answer: 26
