Let's break it down step by step.

If Irene works for 40 hours a week and gets an extra $20 for every hour of overtime, her regular income is 40 x 20 = $800.

For the overtime, she worked 50 hours, and she gets an extra $20 for every hour. So, the overtime income is 10 hours x $20 = $200.

Her total income is her regular income plus her overtime income. So, the total income is 800 + 200 = $1000.

Answer: 1000
