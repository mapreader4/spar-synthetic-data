To find my current age, I'll first find the age of my dog now, and then subtract 2 years to find my age at the time of my dog's birth.

My dog is 4 years old now. So, 2 years ago, my dog was 2 years old. If I was 15 years old when my dog was 0 years old, I must be 15 - 2 = 13 years old now.

Answer: 13
