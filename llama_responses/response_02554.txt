Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the total cost of the small apples. There are 6 small apples, and each costs $1.5, so the total cost of the small apples is 6 x 1.5 = 9 dollars.

Next, let's find the total cost of the medium apples. There are 6 medium apples, and each costs $2, so the total cost of the medium apples is 6 x 2 = 12 dollars.

Finally, let's find the total cost of the big apples. There are 8 big apples, and each costs $3, so the total cost of the big apples is 8 x 3 = 24 dollars.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the apples:

9 + 12 + 24 = 45

So, Donny will have to pay 45 dollars for all of the apples.
