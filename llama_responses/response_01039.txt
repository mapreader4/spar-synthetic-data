Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of apartments is 120.

We know that 85% of the apartments have at least 1 resident, so we can write that as an equation:

85% of 120 = x

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 100:

x = 0.85 * 120 = 102

So, 102 apartments have at least 1 resident.

Now, we know that 60% of the apartments have at least 2 residents. We can set up an equation for this:

60% of 120 = y

We can solve for y by multiplying both sides by 100:

y = 0.6 * 120 = 72

So, 72 apartments have at least 2 residents.

Now, we want to find the number of apartments that have only 1 resident. We know that the total number of apartments is 120, and we know that 102 have at least 1 resident, and 72 have at least 2 residents. So, to find the number of apartments that have only 1 resident, we subtract the number of apartments that have at least 1 resident from the total number of apartments, and then subtract the number of apartments that have at least 2 residents:

120 - 102 - 72 = 6

So, 6 apartments have only 1 resident.

Answer: 6
