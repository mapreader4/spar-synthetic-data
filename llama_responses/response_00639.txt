Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the number of dogs.

15 families own 2 dogs, so that is 30 dogs.

Then, 20 families own 1 dog, so that is 20 dogs.

Now, let's find the number of cats.

20 families own 2 cats each, so that is 40 cats.

To find the total number of dogs and cats, we add the number of dogs and cats: 30 + 40 = 70.

So, the total number of dogs and cats in the community is 70.
