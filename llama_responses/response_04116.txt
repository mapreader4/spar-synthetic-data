Let's break it down step by step.

1. Pierre gets 3 scoops, and each scoop is $2, so the cost of his treat is 3 * 2 = 6 dollars.
2. His mom gets 4 scoops, and each scoop is $2, so the cost of her treat is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.
3. To find the total bill, we add the cost of Pierre's treat to the cost of his mom's treat, so the total bill is 6 + 8 = 14 dollars.
