To solve this problem, we will use the formula to find the circumference of the circle. The formula is:

Circumference = 2 * pi * r, where r is the radius of the circle.

Given the radius is 14 feet, we can plug this value into the formula:

Circumference = 2 * pi * 14

We know that pi is approximately 3.14159, so:

Circumference = 2 * 3.14159 * 14

Circumference = 25.13274

Now, we need to find the number of 6-inch pencils that can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is 28 inches, we can divide the circumference by 6 inches:

28 inches / 6 = 4.6

So, 4.6 is the number of 6-inch pencils that can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle.
