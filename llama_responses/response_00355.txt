Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. There are 10 rows in the grid. 4 rows are colored red, so that leaves 10 - 4 = 6 rows left to be colored green.

2. Each row has 15 squares. 2 rows are colored blue, so that leaves 15 - 2 * 2 = 12 squares left to be colored green.

3. The remaining 12 squares will be colored green.

So, the total number of squares colored green is 12.

Answer: 12
