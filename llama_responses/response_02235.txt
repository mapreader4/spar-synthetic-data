Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the morning. Robbie eats 3 cups of rice in the morning, which is 3 * 10 = 30 grams of fat.

Then, he eats 2 cups of rice in the afternoon, which is 2 * 10 = 20 grams of fat.

Finally, he eats 5 cups of rice in the evening, which is 5 * 10 = 50 grams of fat.

To find the total amount of fat in a week, we add the fat from the morning, afternoon, and evening: 30 + 20 + 50 = 100 grams of fat.

Answer: 100
