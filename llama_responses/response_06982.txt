Let's start by dividing the amount of money Kelly has by the cost of one pound of mangoes. The cost of one pound of mangoes is $0.60. So, we can set up an equation to represent this.

Let's call the number of pounds Kelly can buy x. Then, we can set up the equation:

0.60x = 12

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.60:

x = 12 / 0.60
x = 20

So, Kelly can buy 20 pounds of mangoes with 12 dollars.
