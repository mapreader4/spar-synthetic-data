Let's break this problem down step by step.

Mr. Alonzo harvested 245.5 kg of tomatoes. He sold 125.5 kg to Mrs. Maxwell and 78 kg to Mr. Wilson. Let's find the total amount of tomatoes sold: 125.5 kg + 78 kg = 203.5 kg.

To find the amount of tomatoes not sold, we subtract the total sold from the total amount harvested: 245.5 kg - 203.5 kg = 42 kg.

Answer: 42
