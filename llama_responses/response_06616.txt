Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of students in section Diligence before the transfer is x.

Since there are an equal number of students in both sections, the number of students in section Industry before the transfer is also x.

The total number of students in both sections combined is 50.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 50

This is a simple equation with one variable. To solve for x, we can add -x to both sides of the equation:

x + x - x = 50 - x

This simplifies to:

2x = 50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 50/2

x = 25

So, there were 25 students in section Diligence before the transfer.
