Let's break this down step by step.

Let's assume Divya is currently 5 years old. In 5 years, Nacho will be three times older than Divya.

If Divya is 5 years old, then in 5 years, Divya will be 10 years old.

Nacho will be three times older than Divya, so Nacho will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

To find the sum of their ages now, we need to add the current age of Divya (5) to the age of Nacho (13).

Answer: 5 + 13 = 18
