Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of craters in each helmet.

Dan's skateboarding helmet has 10 more craters than Daniel's ski helmet. So, let's assume Dan's helmet has x craters. Then, we can write an equation to represent this:

x + 10 = Dan's craters

We know that Daniel's helmet has fewer craters than Dan's helmet. So, let's say Daniel's helmet has y craters. Then, we can write another equation to represent this:

y < x

We are given that Rin's snorkel helmet has 15 craters more than the total number of craters in Dan's and Daniel's helmets. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

y = x + 10

We know that Rin's helmet has 75 craters. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

75 = x + 10

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 65

So, the number of craters in Dan's helmet is 65.

Answer: 65
