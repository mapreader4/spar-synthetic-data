Let's start by identifying the number of each type of animal John has.  We know that John has 15 snakes.  He has twice as many monkeys as he does snakes, so he has 15 * 2 = 30 monkeys.  He has 5 fewer lions than he does monkeys, so he has 30 - 5 = 25 monkeys.  John has 8 more pandas than he does lions, so he has 8 + 25 = 33 pandas.  John has 1/3 as many dogs as he does pandas, so he has 1/3 * 33 = 11 dogs.  Now, let's add up all the animals John has: 15 + 30 + 25 + 33 + 11 = 89.  John has 89 animals.  So, the answer is: Answer: 89.
