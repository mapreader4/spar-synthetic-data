To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate the area of the wall.

The area of the wall is 10 feet tall and 15 feet long, which is 10 * 15 = 150 square feet. Each tile is 1 inch square, which means each tile covers 1 square inches. So, to find the number of tiles needed, we need to divide the total area in square inches by the area of each tile.

The area in square inches is 150 square feet * 12 inches * 12 inches = 1800 square inches. To find the number of tiles, we divide 1800 square inches by the area of each tile, which is 1 square inches. The answer is 1800 / 1 = 1800 tiles.

Answer: 1800
