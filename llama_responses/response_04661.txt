Let's calculate the cost of the doorknobs/pulls Amanda is replacing. The cost of the doorknobs/pulls is the total cost of the 18 cabinet knobs plus the 8 drawer pulls.

The cost of the 18 cabinet knobs is 18 x 2.50 = 36.00. The cost of the 8 drawer pulls is 8 x 4.00 = 32.00. The total cost of the doorknobs/pulls is the sum of these two costs. So, the total cost is 36.00 + 32.00 = 68.00.

Answer: 68.
