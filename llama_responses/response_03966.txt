Let's break this down step by step:

Let's start by identifying the total number of pieces of clothing in Luther's latest line. According to the problem, this is given as 13.

Next, we know that half of these 13 pieces are made with cashmere. To find the number of pieces made with cashmere, we can multiply the total number of pieces by 0.5:

13 * 0.5 = 6.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we can round down to the nearest whole number, which is 6.

Therefore, 6 pieces of clothing use a blend of cashmere and silk.

Answer: 6
