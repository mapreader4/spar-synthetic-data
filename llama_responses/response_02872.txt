Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, Giorgio wants to make 2 cookies per student, and there are 40 students. So, the total number of cookies Giorgio needs to make is 2 x 40 = 80.

Now, 10% of the students want oatmeal raisin cookies. To find 10% of 40, I will multiply 10 by 40. 10 x 40 = 400. Since Giorgio wants oatmeal raisin cookies, and 10% of the students want them, Giorgio will make 400 oatmeal raisin cookies.

Answer: 400
