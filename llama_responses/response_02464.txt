Let's break this problem down step by step.

The recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of soap for every 1 cup of water. Since there are 8 ounces in a cup of water, 1 cup of water is equivalent to 8 ounces. 

So, for every 8 ounces of water, we need 3 tablespoons of soap. 

The container can hold 40 ounces of liquid, and we want to know how many cups of water we can make. To find this, we can divide 40 ounces by 8 ounces per cup, which gives us 5 cups. 

Since we need 3 tablespoons of soap for every cup of water, for 5 cups, we need 3 * 5 = 15 tablespoons of soap. 

However, we are not adding the soap itself towards the capacity of the container, so we subtract 3 tablespoons from the total, which is the amount of soap needed for the soap itself. 

So, the answer is: Answer: 12
