Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. It says that Stu has 9 books. It also says that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu. 

So, we can set up an equation to represent the number of books Albert has. We know that Stu has 9 books, and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu. So, we can write the equation: 

Albert's books = 4 x Stu's books

We know that Stu has 9 books, so we can substitute 9 for Stu's books in the equation: 

Albert's books = 4 x 9

To solve for Albert's books, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4: 

Albert's books = 4 x 9

Albert's books = 36

So, Albert has 36 books.

To find the total number of books Stu and Albert have in total, we can add the number of books they each have: 

Stu has 9 books, and Albert has 36 books. So, the total number of books they have in total is: 

Stu's books + Albert's books = 9 + 36

Stu's books + Albert's books = 45

Answer: 45
