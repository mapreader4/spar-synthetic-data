Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first level has 90 parking spaces.
2. The second level has 8 more parking spaces than the first level, so it has 90 + 8 = 98 parking spaces.
3. The third level has 12 more parking spaces than the second level, so it has 98 + 12 = 110 parking spaces.
4. The fourth level has 9 fewer parking spaces than the third level, so it has 110 - 9 = 101 parking spaces.

Now, we need to find the total number of parking spaces available. We can do this by adding up the parking spaces on each level:

90 + 98 + 110 + 101 = 399

Since 100 cars are already parked, we need to subtract that from the total number of parking spaces:

399 - 100 = 299

Answer: 299
