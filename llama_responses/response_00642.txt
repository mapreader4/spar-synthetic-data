To find the total distance Tony needs to drive, we can add the distances together:

10 + 15 + 5 = 30

So, Tony needs to drive 30 miles in total.

To find the distance he will have driven when he is halfway through, we can divide the total distance by 2:

30 / 2 = 15

So, Tony will have driven 15 miles when he is halfway through his errands.
