Let's break it down step by step.

Brittany got a 78 on her first test, so her total score is 78.

Her average is the total score divided by the number of tests. Since she took 2 tests, her average is the total score divided by 2.

The total score is 78, and the number of tests is 2, so the average is 78 / 2 = 39.

Answer: 39
