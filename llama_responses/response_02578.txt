Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

Harper has 15 rubber bands.
His brother has 6 fewer rubber bands than he has.

Let's write an equation to represent this information:

H's rubber bands = 15
Brother's rubber bands = H's rubber bands - 6

To solve for the number of rubber bands they have together, we can add the two numbers:

H's rubber bands + Brother's rubber bands = H's rubber bands + (H's rubber bands - 6)
= 15 + (15 - 6)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Answer: 24
