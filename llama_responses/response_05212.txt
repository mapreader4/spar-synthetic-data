Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Mohamed is currently 2 * 30 years old. This means Mohamed is 60 years old. We are asked to find the age of Kody, who was 4 years ago half as old as Mohamed. 

We know Mohamed was 60 years old 4 years ago, which means Kody was 30 years old 4 years ago. To find Kody's current age, we need to add 4 years to his age 4 years ago. Kody's current age is 30 + 4 = 34. 

Answer: 34
