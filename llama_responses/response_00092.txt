Let's think step by step.

Let's calculate the amount of money Sally makes in a year. She makes $6 per day, so in a year, she will make 365 * $6 = $2190.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Bob makes in a year. He makes $4 per day, so in a year, he will make 365 * $4 = $1460.

Now, they both decide to save half of what they've earned. To find half of the amount, we need to divide each of their earnings by 2.

Sally's half of the earnings will be 2190 / 2 = $1055.

Bob's half of the earnings will be 1460 / 2 = $730.

So, Sally and Bob will have 1055 + 730 = $1785 together.
