Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: "Kristine has 7 more CDs than Dawn. If Dawn has 10 CDs, how many CDs do they have together?"

Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Kristine has 7 more CDs than Dawn. This means that Kristine has 7 + 10 = 17 CDs.
2. Since Dawn has 10 CDs, we know that Dawn has 10 CDs.
3. To find the total number of CDs they have together, we add the number of CDs that Kristine has (17) to the number of CDs Dawn has (10): 17 + 10 = 27.

Answer: 27
