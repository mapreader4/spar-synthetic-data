Let's break this down step by step:

Gerald has 54 farthings, and each farthing is equal to 1/6 of a pfennig. So, Gerald has 54 * (1/6) pfennigs, which is equal to 9 pfennigs.

Gerald wants to buy a pie that costs 2 pfennigs. To find out how many pfennigs Gerald will have left, we need to subtract the cost of the pie from the total number of pfennigs Gerald has:

9 - 2 = 7

Answer: 7
