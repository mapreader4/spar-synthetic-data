Let's start by calculating Tona's deliveries. Since Tona made 3/4 times as many deliveries as Oula, and Oula made 96 deliveries, we can write an equation to represent the number of deliveries made by Tona:

Tona's deliveries = (3/4) * 96

To evaluate this expression, we can multiply 3 by 96:

Tona's deliveries = 72

Now, to find the difference in pay between Oula and Tona, we subtract Tona's deliveries from Oula's deliveries:

Oula's deliveries - Tona's deliveries = 96 - 72

Oula's deliveries - Tona's deliveries = 24

Answer: 24
