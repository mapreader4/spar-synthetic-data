Let's start by finding the total number of paper cranes Alice needs to fold. Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes herself, so she folds 500 cranes. Then, her friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes, which is 100 cranes. So, the total number of paper cranes Alice needs to fold is 1000 - 500 - 100 = 400 cranes.

Answer: 400
