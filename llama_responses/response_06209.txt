Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, Gilbert had 3 basil bushes, 1 parsley plant, and 2 mint plants.

The basil plant dropped seeds and made an extra basil plant, so now Gilbert has 4 basil plants.

The rabbit ate all the mint, so Gilbert lost 2 mint plants.

So, Gilbert had 3 basil plants, 1 parsley plant, and 0 mint plants. This is a total of 4 plants.

Answer: 4
