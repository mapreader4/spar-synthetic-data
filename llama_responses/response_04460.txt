Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate the cost of the weight plates: 200 pounds * $1.2 per pound = $240.

The total cost of the weight plates is $240.

The cost of a 200-pound weight vest is $700. But with a $100 discount, the actual cost is $600.

The difference between the original cost and the discounted cost is $700 - $600 = $100.

So, James saves $100 with his vest.
