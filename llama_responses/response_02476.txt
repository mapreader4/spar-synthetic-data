To find the total money the Super Clean Car Wash Company will make in 5 days, we need to multiply the number of cars cleaned per day by the number of days. In this case, 80 cars are cleaned per day, and we want to know how much money will be made in 5 days.

The number of cars cleaned per day is 80, and the number of days is 5, so we multiply these two numbers together to get:

80 * 5 = 400

The Super Clean Car Wash Company will make 400 cars in 5 days.
