Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cupcakes that are gluten-free.

The problem states that half of the total number of cupcakes are gluten-free. Since there are 80 cupcakes in total, we can find the number of gluten-free cupcakes by multiplying the total number of cupcakes by half.

80 / 2 = 40 gluten-free cupcakes.

Now, we know that half of the gluten-free cupcakes are also vegan, so we can find the number of non-vegan cupcakes that are also gluten-free by taking the total number of vegan cupcakes and subtracting the number of gluten-free cupcakes.

There are 24 vegan cupcakes. 24 - 40 = 16 non-vegan cupcakes that also contain gluten.

Answer: 16
