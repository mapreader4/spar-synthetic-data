Let's start by adding the values of the bills together.

The value of the 2 $100 bills is 2 x 100 = 200.
The value of the 5 $50 bills is 5 x 50 = 250.
The value of the 10 $10 bills is 10 x 10 = 100.

To find the total value of all the bills, we add these together:

200 + 250 + 100 = 550.

Answer: 550
