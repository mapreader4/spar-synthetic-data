Let's break it down step by step.

Suzanne is running a 5-kilometer race. Her parents have pledged to donate $10 for her first kilometer and double the donation for every successive kilometer.

For the first kilometer, her parents will donate $10.
For the second kilometer, they will donate 2 * $10 = $20.
For the third kilometer, they will donate 2 * $20 = $40.
For the fourth kilometer, they will donate 2 * $40 = $80.
For the fifth kilometer, they will donate 2 * $80 = $160.

So, in total, her parents will donate 10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = $210.
