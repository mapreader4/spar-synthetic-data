Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the box with 50 contacts for $25 costs x dollars per contact. Then, the total cost of the box is 50x. Similarly, the box with 99 contacts for $33 costs y dollars per contact. Then, the total cost of the box is 99y.

We know that Adrian chooses the box that costs less per contact. So, we can say that 50x is less than 33y. This means that 50x < 33y.

We can solve this inequality by dividing both sides by y:

50x < 33y

x/y < 33

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides by y:

x = 50y/33

x = 50/33

x = 1.51
