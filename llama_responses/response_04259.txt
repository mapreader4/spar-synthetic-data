Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of sweets the eldest child got: 8.

Then, we know that the youngest child got half as many sweets as the eldest, so the youngest child got half of 8, which is 4.

The total number of sweets given out is 8 + 4 = 12. Since the total number of sweets in the box is 27, we know that the total number of sweets given out is 27 - 12 = 15.

The second child got 15 - 8 = 7 sweets.
