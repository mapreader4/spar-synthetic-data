Let's break it down step by step.

The business sold 25 raffle tickets, each of which costs $2.00. So, the total amount of money they received from the ticket sales is 25 x 2.00 = $50.00.

They also received 2 $15 donations and a $20 donation. The total amount of money they received from the donations is $35.

Adding the total amount of money from ticket sales and donations, we get:

$50.00 + $35.00 = $85.00.

So, the total amount of money raised is $85.00.

Answer: 85
