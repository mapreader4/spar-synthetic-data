Let's break down the cost for each plan:

T-Mobile:
For the first 2 lines, the cost is $50.
For the additional 3 lines, the cost is $16 x 3 = $48.
Total cost with T-Mobile is $50 + $48 = $98.

M-Mobile:
For the first 2 lines, the cost is $45.
For the additional 3 lines, the cost is $14 x 3 = $42.
Total cost with M-Mobile is $45 + $42 = $87.

The difference in cost between the two plans is $98 - $87 = $11.
