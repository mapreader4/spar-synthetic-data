Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the time it takes for Danny to travel 200 miles with the 24 square foot sail.

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 50 MPH = 50 miles per hour

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 200 miles / 50 MPH

Time = 4 hours

Now, let's find the time it takes for Danny to travel 200 miles with the 12 square foot sail.

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 20 MPH = 20 miles per hour

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 200 miles / 20 MPH

Time = 10 hours

The difference in time is:

4 hours - 10 hours = 6 hours

So, the 24 square foot sail is 6 hours faster than the 12 square foot sail.
