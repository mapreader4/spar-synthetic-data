Let's break it down step by step.

Tracy's dogs eat 1.5 cups of food per meal, and they eat 3 meals a day. So, in total, they eat 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 cups of food per day.

Since there are 2 dogs, we multiply 4.5 by 2 to get the total amount of cups of food they eat in a day. 4.5 * 2 = 9.

So, the total amount of cups of food that the 2 dogs eat in a day is 9.
