Let's break this problem down step by step.

Francine drives 140km to work each day. This means that for 1 day, she drives a distance of 140km. To find the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks, we need to multiply the distance she drives each day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week, and she does not go to work 3 days every week).

So, the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks is:

140km/day * 7 = 980km

So, the total distance Francine drives to work for 4 weeks is 980km.

Answer: 980
