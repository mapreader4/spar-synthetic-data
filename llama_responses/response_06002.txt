Let's break this down step by step.

Kathryn's rent is $1200, which is half of her monthly expenses. So, her total monthly expenses are:

$1200 x 2 = $2400

Her salary is $5000 per month, so her total income is $5000.

To find out how much money remains after her expenses, we subtract her expenses from her income:

$5000 - $2400 = $2600

So, Kathryn has $2600 remaining after her expenses.

Answer: 2600
