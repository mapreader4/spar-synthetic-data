Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that:

1. Atticus has 4 marbles.
2. Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, so Jensen has 4 x 2 = 8 marbles.
3. The sum of the number of marbles Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is 60.

We can set up an equation to represent the problem:

Atticus + Jensen + Cruz = 60

We know Atticus has 4 marbles, so we can substitute that into the equation:

4 + 8 + Cruz = 60

To solve for Cruz, we can subtract 4 and 8 from both sides of the equation:

Cruz = 60 - 4 - 8
Cruz = 48

Answer: 48
