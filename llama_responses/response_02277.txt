Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: Davante has twice as many friends as there are days in the week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he has 7 * 2 = 14 friends.

Then, 3 of his friends are girls. This means that the remaining friends are boys. To find the number of boy friends, we subtract 3 from 14: 14 - 3 = 11.

Answer: 11
