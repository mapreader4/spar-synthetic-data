To find the time it takes for the train to reach the destination, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Since the distance is not given, we can assume it is 50 miles. So, we can plug in the values into the formula:

Time = 50 miles / 50 mph = 1 hour

If the speed is 100 mph, the time it takes to reach the destination would be:

Time = 50 miles / 100 mph = 0.5 hours

Answer: 0.5
