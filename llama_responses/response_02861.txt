Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying what we know:

* The Giants have played 20 games and won 12 of them.
* They need to win 2/3 of their games over the season to make the playoffs.
* There are 10 games left.

We can start by converting the fraction 2/3 to a decimal to get the total number of games they need to win:

2/3 = 0.67 (as a decimal)

Since they have already played 20 games, they have won 12 games, so they have 20 - 12 = 8 games remaining to play.

Now, to find out how many more games they need to win, we can multiply the decimal 0.67 by the total number of games left:

0.67 * 8 = 5.36

Since we can't win a fraction of a game, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, the Giants need to win at least 6 games to make the playoffs.

Answer: 6
