Let's break this down step by step.

1. Jack started with $100.
2. He bought 4 bottles of water, each costing $2, so he spent 4 x $2 = $8.
3. Then, his mother asked him to buy twice as many bottles as he bought. So, he bought 2 x 4 = 8 bottles of water.
4. Each bottle of water costs $2, so he spent 8 x $2 = $16 for the 8 bottles.
5. Then, he bought half a pound of cheese and 1 pound of cheese costs $10.
6. So, he spent 0.5 x $10 = $5 on the cheese.

Now, let's add up the money he spent on the water and cheese: $8 + $16 + $5 = $29.
7. He started with $100, so he has $100 - $29 = $71 remaining.
