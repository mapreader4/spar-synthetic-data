Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many 3 egg omelettes and 4 egg omelettes Theo needs to make in total.

For the 3 egg omelettes, he needs to make 5 + 3 = 8 omelettes in the first 2 hours, and no more after that. So, he needs to make a total of 8 omelettes.

For the 4 egg omelettes, he needs to make 7 + 8 = 15 omelettes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for each type of omelette:

For the 3 egg omelettes, he needs to make 8 omelettes, so he needs 8 x 3 = 24 eggs.

For the 4 egg omelettes, he needs to make 15 omelettes, so he needs 15 x 4 = 60 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs needed, we add the number of eggs needed for each type of omelette: 24 + 60 = 84 eggs.

Answer: 84
