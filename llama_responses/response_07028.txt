Let's break it down step by step.

1. 40% of the people have an envelope taped underneath their chairs. So, 40% of 100 people is 0.4 x 100 = 40 people.
2. 20% of these people will have "You Won" in their envelope. So, 20% of 40 people is 0.2 x 40 = 8 people.
3. So, 8 people will have "You Won" in their envelope.
