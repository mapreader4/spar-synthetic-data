Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total cost of the grocery is $16. We know that the 2-pound chicken is not part of the total cost, as we are trying to find out how much Mary and her two friends should pay for the chicken.

2. The 3 pounds of beef cost $4 per pound, so the total cost of the beef is 3 x $4 = $12.

3. The liter of oil costs $1, so the total cost of the oil is $1.

4. The total cost of the beef and oil is $12 + $1 = $13.

5. Since the total cost of the grocery is $16, the cost of the 2-pound chicken is $16 - $13 = $3.

6. Since Mary and her two friends agreed to evenly pay for the cost of the 2-pound chicken, they should each pay $3 / 3 = $1.
