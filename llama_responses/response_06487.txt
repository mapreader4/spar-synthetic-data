Let's think step by step.

Let's start by letting x be the number of marbles Zack had initially. If he gave his three friends 20 marbles each and kept 5 for himself, then the total number of marbles he gave away is 3 x 20 = 60. This is because 3 x 20 is the total number of marbles he gave away, and 5 is the number he kept for himself.

So, the total number of marbles Zack had initially is 60 + 5 = 65. 

Answer: 65
