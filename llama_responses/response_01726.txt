Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that 2/3 of the population are females, which is the same as 2/3 * 300 = 200 students. We are not given the number of total males, but we can find it by subtracting the number of females from the total number of students. 

Let's subtract 200 from 300 to get the number of males. 300 - 200 = 100.

So, there are 100 male students.
