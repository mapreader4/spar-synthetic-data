Let's break it down step by step:

James has 500 dollars initially.

The first two parking tickets cost 150 dollars each, so the total cost is 2 x 150 = 300 dollars.

The third ticket costs 1/3 as much as one of the first two, so it costs 1/3 x 150 = 50 dollars.

The roommate agrees to pay half the cost of the last ticket, which is 50 dollars, so he pays 1/2 x 50 = 25 dollars.

So, James has 500 - 300 - 25 = 175 dollars left.
