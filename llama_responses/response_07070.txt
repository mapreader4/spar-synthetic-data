Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of pieces of bread needed for one regular sandwich. We know that 2 pieces of bread are needed for one regular sandwich.

Next, we know that 3 pieces of bread are needed for a double meat sandwich. So, for a double meat sandwich, 3 pieces of bread are needed.

Now, let's figure out how many pieces of bread are needed for 14 regular sandwiches. Since each regular sandwich requires 2 pieces of bread, we can multiply 14 by 2 to get the total number of pieces of bread needed for the regular sandwiches: 14 * 2 = 28.

Finally, we know that 12 double meat sandwiches require 3 pieces of bread each. So, for 12 double meat sandwiches, we can multiply 12 by 3 to get the total number of pieces of bread needed: 12 * 3 = 36.

To find the total number of pieces of bread needed for 14 regular sandwiches and 12 double meat sandwiches, we add the number of pieces of bread needed for each: 28 + 36 = 64.

Answer: 64
