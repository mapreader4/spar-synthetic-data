Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, there are 50 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 16 more passengers get on the bus, so the total number of passengers becomes:

50 + 16 = 66

At the other stops, 22 passengers get off the bus, leaving the remaining:

66 - 22 = 44 passengers on the bus.

Then, 5 passengers get on the bus, so the total number of passengers becomes:

44 + 5 = 49

So, the answer is:

Answer: 49
