Let's break this down step by step:

Let's first find out how much Janet spends on clarinet lessons in a year.

She spends $40/hour for 3 hours per week, so for a year of 52 weeks, that is:

40 x 3 x 52 = $1,040

Next, let's find out how much she spends on piano lessons. She spends $28/hour for 5 hours per week, so for a year of 52 weeks, that is:

28 x 5 x 52 = $1,440

Now, let's find out how much more she spends on piano lessons than clarinet lessons:

$1,440 - $1,040 = $400

So, Janet spends $400 more on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year.
