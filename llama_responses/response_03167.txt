Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Alexia inflates 20 balls, and Ermias inflates 5 more balls than Alexia. This means Ermias inflates 20 + 5 = 25 balls.

Step 2: To inflate 20 balls, Alexia takes 20 minutes. To inflate 25 balls, Ermias takes 20 + 5 = 25 minutes. 

Step 3: The total time to inflate all the soccer balls is the sum of the time taken by Alexia and Ermias. 

Answer: 20 + 25 = 45
