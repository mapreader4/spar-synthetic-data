Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Charles runs at 6 MPH when he's got music on, which means that for every hour, he covers 6 miles.
2. Since the album is 40 minutes long, we need to convert the time to minutes to find the number of times he'll need to listen to the album to cover 6 miles. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows: 40 minutes = 40/60 = 2/3 hours.
3. Since he runs 6 miles in 1 hour, he'll run 6/1 = 6 miles in 1/3 hours. So, in 2/3 hours, he'll run 6*2/3 = 4 miles. Since he needs to run 6 miles, he'll need to listen to the album 6/4 = 1.5 times.
4. Since he'll need to listen to the album 1.5 times, and the album is 40 minutes long, he'll need 1.5 * 40 = 60 minutes to listen to the entire album.

Answer: 60
