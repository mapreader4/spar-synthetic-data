Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Joyce's new property is 10 times larger than her previous property.
* Her previous property was 2 acres.
* Her new land has a 1-acre pond where she cannot grow vegetables.

To find the total area of her new property, we can multiply the size of her previous property by 10:

2 acres (previous property) x 10 = 20 acres

However, we need to subtract the area of the pond from the total area to find the area suitable for growing vegetables:

20 acres (total area) - 1 acre (pond) = 19 acres

So, Joyce now owns 19 acres of land that are suitable for growing vegetables.

Answer: 19
