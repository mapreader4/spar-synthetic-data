Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the length of the straight part of the river is x.

Since the length of the river is 80 miles, and the length of the straight part is 3 times shorter, we can set up an equation.

x + 3x = 80

We can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 80 / 4
x = 20

So, the length of the straight part of the river is 20 miles.

Answer: 20
