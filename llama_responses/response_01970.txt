Let's start by finding the total number of slices of pizza. Since there is 1 box of pizza that is cut into 16 slices, the total number of slices is 16.

Then, we know that three-fourths of the pizza was eaten. So, we can set up an equation: 16 x 3/4 =?.

To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 4 to get 16 * 3 = 48. So, the number of slices of pizza eaten is 48.

Now, to find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices. So, 16 - 48 = 8.

Answer: 8
