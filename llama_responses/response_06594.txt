To find the number of paper plates Max needs, I will subtract the number of paper plates he already has from the total number of paper plates he needs. The total number of paper plates Max needs is 65, and he already has 22 green paper plates and 24 blue paper plates. So, to find the number of paper plates he needs, I will subtract 22 + 24 from 65. 22 + 24 is 46. So, Max needs 65 - 46 more paper plates. Answer: 19
