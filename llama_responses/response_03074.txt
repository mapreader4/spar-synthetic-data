Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, Carter has 20 green M&Ms and 20 red M&Ms.

He eats 12 of the green M&Ms, leaving 8 green M&Ms.

His sister eats half of the red M&Ms, which is 10, leaving 10 red M&Ms. Then, she adds 14 yellow M&Ms.

Now, there are 8 green M&Ms, 10 red M&Ms, and 14 yellow M&Ms. In total, there are 8 + 10 + 14 = 32 M&Ms.

Out of these 32 M&Ms, 8 are green, so the probability of picking a green M&M is:

8 / 32 = 1/4 or 25%.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 25
