Let's break this problem down step by step.

Winston starts with 10 gallons of gas in his car's gas tank.

He uses 6 gallons of gas to drive to the store.

So, he has 10 - 6 = 4 gallons of gas left in the tank.

Then, he uses 2 gallons of gas to drive to the doctor's office.

So, he has 4 - 2 = 2 gallons of gas left in the tank.

The tank can hold up to 12 gallons of gas. To fill the tank, he needs 12 - 2 = 10 gallons of gas.
