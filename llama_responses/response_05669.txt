Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jett bought the cow for $600.

2. He spent $20 every day to buy food for the cow. So, after 40 days, he spent a total of $20 * 40 = $800 on food.

3. He used $500 to vaccinate and deworm the cow.

4. After selling the cow for $2500, he got $2500.

5. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the cow and the cost of food and vaccinations from the selling price.

Cost of cow: $600
Cost of food: $800
Cost of vaccinations and deworming: $500
Total cost: $600 + $800 + $500 = $1400

Profit = Selling price - Total cost
= $2500 - $1400
= $1100

Answer: 1100
