Let's break it down step by step:

1. The size of the drawing is 9 by 13, which means the area of the drawing is 9 x 13 = 117 square units.
2. The cost of the black and white drawing is $160.
3. The cost of the color drawing is 50% more expensive than the black and white drawing, so the cost of the color drawing is 1.5 times the cost of the black and white drawing, which is 1.5 x 160 = 240.
4. The total cost of the drawing is the sum of the cost of the black and white drawing and the cost of the color drawing, which is 160 + 240 = 400.

Answer: 400
