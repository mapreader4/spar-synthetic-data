Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total height of the stairs John climbs up.

The total height is 9 flights * 10 feet, which is 90 feet.

Each step is 18 inches.  To convert feet to inches, we multiply by 12, so each step is 216 inches.

So, John climbs 90 feet * 12 = 1080 inches.

Answer: 1080
