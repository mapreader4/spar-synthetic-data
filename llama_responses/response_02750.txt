Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Zoe babysat Zachary 1/5 the number of times she babysat Chloe. Let's say the number of times she babysat Chloe is x. Then, the number of times she babysat Zachary would be x/5.

We know that the number of times she babysat Zachary was 1/3 the number of times she babysat Julie. So, we can set up the equation:

x/5 = 1/3 * Julie

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 15 * 1/3 * Julie

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

x = 5 * Julie

So, the number of times she babysat Zachary is 5 times the number of times she babysat Julie.

We know that Zoe earned $600 babysitting Zachary. We can set up the equation:

5 * Julie * x = 600

To solve for Julie, we can divide both sides by 5:

Julie * x = 600 / 5

Julie * x = 120

Now, we know that Julie is 3 times the number of times Zoe babysat Zachary. So, we can set up the equation:

Julie = 3 * x

To solve for Julie, we can divide both sides by 3:

Julie = 120 / 3

Julie = 40

So, the number of times she babysat Julie is 40.

Now, we can find the total number of times she babysat:

Total times babysat = Julie + Zachary + Chloe
= 40 + 5 * 40 + x
= 40 + 200 + x

We know that the total amount of money she made was $8,000. We can set up the equation:

40 + 200 + x = 8000

To solve for x, we can subtract 40 and 200 from both sides:

x = 8000 - 240

x = 7760

So, Zoe earned $7760 from pool cleaning.
