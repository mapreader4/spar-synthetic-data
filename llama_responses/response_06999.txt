Let's break this down step by step.

James starts by eating a quarter pound of asparagus and a quarter pound of broccoli per day, so in a week, he eats 7 x (1/4 + 1/4) = 1.5 pounds of asparagus and 7 x (1/4 + 1/4) = 1.5 pounds of broccoli.

After 2 weeks, he doubles that amount and adds 3 pounds of kale per week.  So, he eats 2 x (1.5 + 1.5) = 3 pounds of asparagus and 2 x (1.5 + 1.5) = 3 pounds of broccoli.  Then, he adds 3 pounds of kale per week.  So, the total amount of vegetables he eats in a week is 3 + 3 = 6 pounds.
