Let's break this problem down step by step.

Anna started with $10.00. She spent money on 3 packs of chewing gum for $1.00 each. So she spent 3 x 1.00 = $3.00. She then spent money on 5 chocolate bars at $1 each, so she spent 5 x 1.00 = $5.00. Finally, she spent money on 2 large candy canes for $0.50 each, so she spent 2 x 0.50 = $1.00. In total, she spent $3.00 + $5.00 + $1.00 = $9.00. So, Anna had $10.00 - $9.00 = $1.00 left.
