Let's break it down step by step.

1. The regular medium pizza price is $18. To take full advantage of the promotion, we need to buy one regular large pizza, which will cost $18, and then 3 medium pizzas for $5 each.

2. The total cost of the regular large pizza is $18.
3. The total cost of the 3 medium pizzas is 3 x $5 = $15.
4. The total cost of the promotion is the cost of the large pizza plus the cost of the 3 medium pizzas: $18 + $15 = $33.

5. So, the total savings is the original price minus the promotion price: $18 - $33 = $15.
