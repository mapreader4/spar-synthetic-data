Let's start by identifying the variables in the problem:

* The number of clusters of oats in each spoonful is 4.
* The number of spoonfuls of cereal in each bowl is 25.
* The number of clusters of oats in each box is 500.

We can start by identifying the unknown variable: the number of bowlfuls of cereal in each box. Let's call this variable "x".

Since there are 25 spoonfuls of cereal in each bowl, and each spoonful has 4 clusters of oats, we can find the number of clusters of oats in each bowl by multiplying the number of spoonfuls by the number of clusters per spoonful: 25 * 4 = 100 clusters.

Now, we know that each box has 500 clusters of oats. Since each cluster of oats is a group of 4 clusters, we can divide 500 by 4 to find the number of clusters in each cluster: 500 รท 4 = 125 clusters.

Now, we can find the number of bowlfuls of cereal in each box by dividing the number of clusters of oats in each cluster by the number of clusters per bowlful: 125 รท 25 = 5.

So, the number of bowlfuls of cereal in each box is 5.

Answer: 5
