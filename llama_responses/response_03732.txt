To find the number of minutes David spent reading, we can subtract the total time spent on his homework and the time he spent reading from the total time he had. He had 60 minutes in total. He spent 15 minutes on his math homework and 18 minutes on his spelling homework, so the total time spent on homework is 15 + 18 = 33. So, he spent 60 - 33 = 27 minutes reading.
