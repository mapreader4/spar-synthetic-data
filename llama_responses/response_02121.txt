Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* A jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does.
* A jar of peanut butter costs $3.
* A batch of cookies requires half a jar of almond butter.

Let's use the information to create an equation to solve the problem.

Let's say the cost of almond butter is x.

Since a jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does, we can set up an equation:

x = 3 * 3

x = 9

Since a jar of peanut butter costs $3, we know that x is equal to $9.

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to make a batch of almond butter cookies. Since a batch requires half a jar of almond butter, we can multiply the cost of almond butter by 0.5:

9 * 0.5 = 4.5

It costs $4.50 to make a batch of almond butter cookies instead of peanut butter cookies.
