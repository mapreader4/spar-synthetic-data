Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find the number of students who got in for each instrument:

- Flute: 80% of 20 = 0.8 * 20 = 16
- Clarinet: Half of 30 = 30 / 2 = 15
- Trumpet: 1/3 of 60 = 60 / 3 = 20
- Piano: 1/10th of 20 = 20 / 10 = 2

Now, let's add up the number of students who got in for each instrument:

16 + 15 + 20 + 2 = 51

Answer: 51
