To find the number of pages Joanna needs to read to finish the book, we need to subtract the number of pages she has read from the total number of pages.

The total number of pages Joanna has read is 16 * 3 + 16 * 6.5 = 48 + 102 = 150 pages.

The total number of pages in the book is 248. So, we subtract 150 from 248 to find the number of pages she needs to read:

248 - 150 = 98

Answer: 98
