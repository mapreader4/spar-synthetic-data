Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Yasmin's current age is x. Xavier is twice as old as Yasmin, so Xavier's current age is 2x.

We are told that Xavier will be 30 years old in six years. So, Xavier's age in six years is 2x + 6.

We are asked to find the total of their ages now. So, Yasmin's current age is x and Xavier's current age is 2x. Their total age is x + 2x.

We know that Xavier will be 30 in six years, so we can set up an equation to represent this. We can set the equation to be 2x + 6 = 30, which can be solved for x.

2x + 6 = 30

Subtract 6 from both sides to get 2x = 24.

So, Yasmin is 24 years old. Xavier is twice as old as Yasmin, so Xavier is 2 * 24 = 48 years old.

The total of their ages is 24 + 48 = 72. 

Answer: 72
