Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The tank originally had 6000 liters of water.
2. 2000 liters evaporated, so we subtract that from the total amount of water: 6000 - 2000 = 4000 liters.
3. Then, 3500 liters were drained by Bob, so we subtract that from the remaining water: 4000 - 3500 = 500 liters.
4. The tank is now empty for 30 minutes, and every 10 minutes 350 liters of rain are added to the tank. We need to calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 30 minutes: 30 minutes / 10 = 3.
5. So, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount of rain added in each interval: 3 * 350 = 1050 liters.
6. We add the total amount of rain to the remaining water in the tank: 500 + 1050 = 1550 liters.

Answer: 1550
