Let's break this down step by step.

The top bed can hold 4 rows of 25 seeds each, so the total number of seeds that can be planted in the top bed is 4 x 25 = 100. The medium bed can hold 3 rows of 20 seeds each, so the total number of seeds that can be planted in the medium bed is 3 x 20 = 60. The total number of seeds that can be planted in both the top and medium beds is 100 + 60 = 160.

So, the total number of seeds that can be planted in all four beds of the raised bed garden is 160.
