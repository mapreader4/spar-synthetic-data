Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's let Jake's snake be x inches long. Then, Jenny's snake is 12 inches shorter than Jake's snake, so Jenny's snake is x - 12 inches long.

We know that the combined length of the two snakes is 70 inches. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

x + (x - 12) = 70

To solve for x, we can add 12 to both sides of the equation to get:

x + x - 12 + 12 = 70 + 12

This simplifies to:

2x = 82

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 82 / 2

x = 41

So, Jake's snake is 41 inches long.
