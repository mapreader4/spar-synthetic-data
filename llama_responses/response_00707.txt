Let's break this down step by step:

1. Melanie tears the 2 slices of bread into smaller pieces.
2. She tears each slice in half, so that's 2 pieces per slice.
3. She tears each of those halves in half, so that's 4 pieces per slice.
4. Since there are 2 slices of bread, she tears 2 x 4 = 8 pieces of bread in total.

So, Melanie is going to put 8 bread pieces into the blender.
