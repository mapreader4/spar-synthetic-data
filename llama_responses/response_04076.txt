Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of goldfish that need to eat special food. 20% of the goldfish need to eat special food. To find this number, we multiply the total number of goldfish by 0.20. So, we multiply 50 * 0.20, which gives us 10.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to feed these fish. Each goldfish eats 1.5 ounces of food per day. The special food costs $3 per ounce. So, to feed one goldfish, it will cost 1.5 * 3 = 4.5 dollars. To feed 10 goldfish, it will cost 10 * 4.5 = 45 dollars.

So, the answer is: Answer: 45
