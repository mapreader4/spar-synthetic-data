Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Justin's current age is x.

Since Angelina is 4 years older than Justin, then Angelina's current age is x + 4.

In 5 years, Angelina's age will be 40. So, 40 = x + 4 + 5.

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get x + 4 = 35.

So, Justin's current age is 35.

Answer: 35
