Let's start by identifying the given information. We know that Mohammad has 80 bags of chips, and one quarter of the bags are Doritos. To find the number of bags of Doritos, we can multiply the total number of bags by one quarter:

80 * 1/4 = 20

So, Mohammad has 20 bags of Doritos. To find the number of bags of Doritos in each pile, we can divide the total number of bags by 4:

20 รท 4 = 5
