Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of beakers without copper ions that were tested is x.

We know that 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found. This means that the 45 drops are used to test the beakers that have copper ions, leaving no copper ions behind.

Since each beaker requires 3 drops to turn the liquid blue, the number of beakers tested with copper ions is 45 / 3 = 15.

Since there are 22 beakers in total, and 8 of them have copper ions, the number of beakers without copper ions is 22 - 8 = 14.

So, 14 beakers without copper ions were tested.

Answer: 14
