Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Andy harvests all the tomatoes from 18 plants that have 7 tomatoes each. So, the total number of tomatoes is 18 * 7 = 126.

Step 2: Andy dries half of the tomatoes. Half of 126 is 126 / 2 = 63.

Step 3: Andy turns a third of the remainder into marinara sauce. A third of 63 is 63 / 3 = 21.

Step 4: So, the number of tomatoes left is 126 - 63 - 21 = 42.

Answer: 42
