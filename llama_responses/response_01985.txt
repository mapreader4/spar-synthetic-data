Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many seconds it takes to fill the basin. If the basin can hold 260 gallons of water and the waterfall flows at 24 gallons per second, then the number of seconds it takes to fill the basin can be calculated as follows:

Let x be the number of seconds it takes to fill the basin. The total amount of water that flows out of the waterfall in x seconds is 24x. The total amount of water that goes into the basin in x seconds is 4x. So, the equation is:

24x = 260

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 24:

x = 260 / 24

x = 10.83

So it takes 10.83 seconds to fill the basin.

Answer: 10.83
