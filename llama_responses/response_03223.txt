Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that the ratio of roosters to hens is 2 to 1, and we are given the total number of chickens, which is 9,000. To find the number of roosters, we can set up a proportion:

Roosters : Hens = 2 : 1

We can represent this proportion as a fraction: 2/1. To find the number of roosters, we can multiply both sides of the fraction by the total number of chickens:

(2/1) * 9000 = 2 * 9000 = 18000

Answer: 18000
