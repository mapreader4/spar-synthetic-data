Let's break this down step by step.

First, Maggie sells 4 magazines to her parents. 4 x $5.00 is 20.00.

Then, she sells 1 magazine to her grandfather. 1 x $5.00 is 5.00.

Then, she sells 2 magazines to the next-door neighbor. 2 x $5.00 is 10.00.

And then, she sells twice that amount to another neighbor. 2 x 10.00 is 20.00.

So, Maggie earns a total of 20.00 + 5.00 + 10.00 + 20.00, which is 45.00.
