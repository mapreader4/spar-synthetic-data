Let's start by identifying the total amount of metal roofing that Mr. Caiden needs, which is 300 feet.

Mr. Caiden already gets 250 feet for free, so he needs to buy the remaining amount of metal roofing. To find this out, we can subtract the amount he gets for free from the total amount needed: 300 - 250 = 50.

Since each foot of metal roofing costs $8, Mr. Caiden needs to pay 50 * 8 = 400 dollars for the remaining metal roofing.

Answer: 400
