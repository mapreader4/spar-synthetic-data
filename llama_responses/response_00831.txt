Let's start by identifying the number of popsicle sticks each person has.

Sam has thrice as many as Sid, and Sid has twice as many as Steve. This means that Sam has 2 * 12 = 24 popsicle sticks and Sid has 2 * 12 = 24 popsicle sticks.

To find the total number of popsicle sticks, we add the number of popsicle sticks each person has: 24 + 24 = 48.

So, they can use 48 popsicle sticks for their Art class activity.
