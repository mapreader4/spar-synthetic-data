Let's break it down step by step:

There are 4 tables that seat 6 people each, so that is 4 x 6 = 24 people. There are 16 tables that seat 4 people each, so that is 16 x 4 = 64 people. There are 8 round tables that seat 10 people each, so that is 8 x 10 = 80 people.

Adding all these up, the total capacity is 24 + 64 + 80 = 168 people. Answer: 168
