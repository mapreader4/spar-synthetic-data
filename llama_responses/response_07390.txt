Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given: "Today is my birthday and I'm three times older than I was six years ago." This tells us that the person is referring to their age in relation to their birthday.

Let's use the information that the person is three times older than they were six years ago to solve for the person's current age.

Let's say the person's age in six years ago was x. Then, the person's current age is 3x.

We are told that the person is three times older than they were six years ago. So, we can set up an equation: 3x = x + 6.

Now, we can solve for the person's current age by subtracting six from both sides of the equation: 3x = x - 6.

x - 6 = 3x - 6 = 0.

x = 18.

Answer: 18
