Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of football players: 13.

If 10 football players quit, then we subtract 10 from the total number of football players. So, we get:

13 - 10 = 3

So, there are 3 football players left.

Now, let's look at the cheerleaders. There are initially 16 cheerleaders. If 4 cheerleaders quit, then we subtract 4 from the total number of cheerleaders. So, we get:

16 - 4 = 12

So, there are 12 cheerleaders left.

Answer: 3 football players, 12 cheerleaders.
