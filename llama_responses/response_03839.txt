Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given to us. We know that Quentavious has 5 nickels, and he gets 2 nickels and leaves with 3 nickels. We need to find the number of nickels he has left with.

Let's use the information that he leaves with 3 nickels. Since he started with 5 nickels and left with 3, we can find the number of nickels he has left with by subtracting the number of nickels he left with from the number of nickels he started with. So, we get:

5 - 3 = 2

Answer: 2
