Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, there are 2400 pollywogs in the pond.

Every day, 50 pollywogs mature into toads and leave the pond. This means that the number of pollywogs in the pond decreases by 50 each day.

For the first 20 days, Melvin catches 10 pollywogs per day and releases them into the stream. This means that the number of pollywogs in the pond decreases by 50 - 10 = 40 pollywogs per day for the first 20 days.

So, after 20 days, the number of pollywogs in the pond is 2400 - (20 x 40) = 2000.

After the first 20 days, there are no more pollywogs being caught by Melvin, so the number of pollywogs in the pond decreases by 50 per day.

It will take 40 more days for the remaining 2000 pollywogs to disappear from the pond, since 2000 / 50 = 40.

Adding the 20 days when Melvin was catching pollywogs to the 40 days it takes for the remaining pollywogs to disappear, we get a total of 20 + 40 = 60 days.

Answer: 60
