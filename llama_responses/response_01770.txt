Let's break down the total word count of 5000 into the different parts. The total word count of the introduction is 450 words. The conclusion will be 3 times the length of the introduction, so the word count for the conclusion will be 3 x 450 = 1350 words. The 4 body sections will be the same length, so each body section will be 5000 - 450 - 1350 = 1250 words. So, the word count for each section is 1250.
