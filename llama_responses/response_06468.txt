Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Alan bought a $2000 phone online.
* John bought it 2% more expensive in a local store.

To find the amount John spent, we need to find the difference between the two prices. We know the price of the phone online is $2000. To find the price of the phone in the local store, we need to multiply the 2% increase by the original price. So, we do 2% of $2000 is 0.04. So, the price in the local store is $2000 + 0.04 * 2000 = $2000 + $80 = $2080.

So, John spent $2080 on his phone.
