Let's think step by step.

Enrico sold a 30-kilogram rooster, so that's 30 x $0.50 = $15.00.
He also sold a 40-kilogram rooster, so that's 40 x $0.50 = $20.00.

To find the total amount of money Enrico earned, we need to add these two amounts together. 15.00 + 20.00 = 35.00.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 35
