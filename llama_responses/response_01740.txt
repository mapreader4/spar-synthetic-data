Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Dwayne makes $1,500 in a year. We know that Brady will make $450 more than Dwayne. So, we can subtract $1,500 and $450 to get Brady's annual income, which is $1,050.

So, Dwayne makes $1,500 and Brady makes $1,050. To find their combined income, we add their incomes together. $1,500 + $1,050 is $2,550.

Answer: 2550
