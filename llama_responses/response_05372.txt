Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of boxes: 10 boxes.

Each box has 20 packs of tissues, so the total number of packs is 10 x 20 = 200.

Each pack of tissues costs 5 cents, so the total cost of all the packs is 200 x 5 cents = 1000 cents.

Now, the total amount of money Annalise spent is the cost of all the packs, which is 1000 cents.
