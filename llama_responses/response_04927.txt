Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first tree was 1000 feet tall.
2. The next two trees were half as tall as the first tree, so they were 1000 / 2 = 500 feet tall.
3. The last tree was 200 feet taller than the first tree, so it was 1000 + 200 = 1200 feet tall.

To find the average height of the trees, we need to add the heights of all the trees and then divide by the number of trees:

1000 + 500 + 1200 = 2700

There were 3 trees, so we divide the total height by 3:

2700 / 3 = 900

Answer: 900
