Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Smith's Bakery sold more than four times the number of pies that McGee's Bakery sold. 
* McGee's Bakery sold 16 pies.

So, we can write an equation to represent the relationship between the number of pies sold by Smith's Bakery and the number of pies sold by McGee's Bakery:

Let x be the number of pies sold by Smith's Bakery.

The equation is: 6x = 4 * 16

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 6x = 4 * 16 / 4

x = 6

So, Smith's Bakery sold 6 pies.
