Let's break this down step by step.

Kendra has 4 packs of pens, which means she has a total of 4 x 3 = 12 pens. Tony has 2 packs of pens, which means he has a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pens.

Kendra and Tony decide to keep 2 pens each. So, Kendra keeps 2 pens and Tony keeps 2 pens. That leaves 12 - 2 - 2 = 8 pens remaining.

They will give the remaining pens to their friends one pen per friend. So, they will give pens to 8 friends.
