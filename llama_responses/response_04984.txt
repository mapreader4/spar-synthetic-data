Let's break this down step by step.

Let's let x be the number of years of experience Bill has.

Since 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill, so we can set up an equation.

Joan had 3x experience 5 years ago, and now she has twice as much experience as Bill, so we can set up an equation.

3x = 5x

Now we can solve for x, the number of years of experience Bill has now.

x = 5/3 * 2 = 5/3 * 2 = 10/3 = 3.33

So Bill has 3.33 years of experience now.
