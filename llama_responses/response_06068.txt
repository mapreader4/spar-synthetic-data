Let's break it down step by step.

Tabitha has 25 dollars. She gives her mom 8 dollars, so she has 25 - 8 = 17 dollars left.

She invests half of what's left in a money market. Half of 17 is 8.5. So she has 17 - 8.5 = 8.5 dollars left.

She spends some money on 5 items that cost 50 cents each. 5 x 50 cents is 250 cents. 250 cents is 2.5 dollars and 50 cents. So she has 8.5 - 2.5 = 6 dollars left.
