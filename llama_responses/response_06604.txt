Let's break this down step by step:

Let the number of women be x.

The number of cannoneers is double the number of women, so the number of cannoneers is 2x.

We are given that there are 63 cannoneers. So, we can set up an equation: 2x = 63.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us x = 31.5.

Since x is the number of women, there are 31 women.

The total number of men is twice the number of women, so the total number of men is 2x, which is 2 * 31 = 62.

To find the total number of people, we add the number of women and men: 31 + 62 = 93.

Answer: 93
