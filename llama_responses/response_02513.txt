Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of chefs and waiters. We know that there are 16 chefs and 16 waiters initially.

If 6 chefs and 3 waiters drop out, we need to subtract these numbers from the total. So, we can set up the subtraction problem as follows:

16 - 6 = 10 chefs left
16 - 3 = 13 waiters left

So, there are 10 chefs and 13 waiters left.
