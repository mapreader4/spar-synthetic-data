Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of sweaters Kim knit on each day.

* Monday: 10 sweaters
* Tuesday: 2 more than Monday, so 10 + 2 = 12 sweaters
* Wednesday and Thursday: 4 fewer than Tuesday, so 12 - 4 = 8 sweaters
* Friday: half the number of sweaters she had knit on Monday, which is 10, so 10 / 2 = 5 sweaters

Now, let's add up the total number of sweaters Kim knit:

10 + 12 + 8 + 8 + 5 = 38

Answer: 38
