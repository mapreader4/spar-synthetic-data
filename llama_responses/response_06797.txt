Let's break down the information given into smaller parts.

Barney can do 45 sit-ups in one minute.
Carrie can do twice as many sit-ups per minute as Barney can, so Carrie can do 2 * 45 = 90 sit-ups in one minute.
Jerrie can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie can do, so Jerrie can do 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups in one minute.

To find the total number of sit-ups performed, we add the number of sit-ups performed by each person. Barney does 45 sit-ups in one minute, Carrie does 2 * 45 = 90 sit-ups in two minutes, and Jerrie does 95 sit-ups in three minutes.

The total number of sit-ups performed is 45 + 90 + 95 = 230.

Answer: 230
