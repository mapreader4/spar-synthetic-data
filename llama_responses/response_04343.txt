Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate how much Janina needs to earn each day to cover her expenses.

Janina spends $30 each day for rent, and she uses $12 worth of supplies daily. So, her total daily expenses are $30 + $12 = $42.

Now, she sells each pancake for $2, so we need to find out how many pancakes she needs to sell to earn $42.

To do this, we can divide her daily expenses by the price of each pancake: $42 รท $2 = 21.

So, Janina needs to sell 21 pancakes each day to cover her expenses.
