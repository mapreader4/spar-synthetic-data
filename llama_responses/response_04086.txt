Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that the number of dishes Sandrine washed was 10 more than the number of bananas Charles cooked. Let's call the number of bananas Charles cooked x.

The information that Charles picked 50 pears means that the number of pears is 50.

Since the number of bananas Charles cooked is 3 times the number of pears he picked, we can set up an equation to represent the number of bananas Charles cooked:

x = 3 * 50

x = 150

Now, we know that the number of dishes Sandrine washed is 10 more than the number of bananas Charles cooked, so we can set up an equation to represent the number of dishes Sandrine washed:

Sandrine's dishes = x + 10

Substituting the value of x, we get:

Sandrine's dishes = 160

Answer: 160
