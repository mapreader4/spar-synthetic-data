Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of students who scored 100%. We know that 2/5 of the 80 students scored 100%, which means 2 x 16 = 32 students scored 100%.

Next, we need to find the number of students who didn't score 100%. That is, the remaining 80 - 32 = 48 students.

Now, we are told that 50% of these 48 students scored over 80%. To find the number of students who scored over 80%, we can multiply 48 by 0.5, which gives us 24 students.

Now, we need to find the number of students who failed the exam. To do this, we subtract the number of students who scored over 80% from the total number of students who didn't score 100%. That is, we subtract 24 from 48, which gives us 24.

So, the number of students who failed the exam is 24.

Answer: 24
