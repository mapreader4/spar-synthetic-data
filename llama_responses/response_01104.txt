Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of people who bought the tickets initially. We know that three-fourths of the total number of people who bought the tickets came before the start of the concert. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information: 

Let's say the total number of people who bought the tickets is x.

Since three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert, we can set up an equation:

x * 3/4 = 9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get:

x = 9 * 4/3
x = 12

So, 12 people bought the tickets before the start of the concert.

Now, let's find the number of people who came after the start of the concert. We know that five-ninths of the remaining people came few minutes after the first song. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

The total number of people who bought the tickets is 12, and five-ninths of those who bought the tickets came after the start of the concert. So, we can set up an equation:

12 - 5/9 = 1

To solve for the number of people who came after the start of the concert, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9 to get:

12 * 9/5
1 = 18

So, 18 people came after the start of the concert.

Now, let's find the number of people who did not go. We know that 12 bought the tickets before the start of the concert and 18 came after the start of the concert. So, the number of people who did not go is the difference between the total number of people who bought the tickets and the number of people who came before and after the start of the concert:

12 + 18 = 30

So, 30 people did not go.
