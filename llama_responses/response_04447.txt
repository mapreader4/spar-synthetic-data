Let's break down the time it takes Martiza to learn each type of question:

* Multiple-choice questions: 15 minutes each, so 30 questions will take 30 x 15 = 450 minutes
* Fill-in-the-blank questions: 25 minutes each, so 30 questions will take 30 x 25 = 750 minutes

Total time to learn all questions: 450 + 750 = 1200 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide 1200 by 60: 1200 รท 60 = 20

Answer: 20
