Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's first find the total number of tickets the school has. Since each roll of tickets has 100 tickets, and there are 3 groups of students, we can multiply 100 x 3 = 300 tickets.

The 4th graders bought 30% of the tickets. To find 30% of 300, we can multiply 300 x 0.3 = 90 tickets.

The 5th graders bought 50% of the remaining tickets. To find 50% of 210, we can multiply 210 x 0.5 = 105 tickets.

The 6th graders bought 100 tickets. So, the total number of tickets bought by the 6th graders is 100.

Now, let's subtract the total number of tickets bought by the 4th and 5th graders from the total number of tickets. 90 + 105 - 195 = 195.

The remaining tickets are the unsold tickets. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 105
