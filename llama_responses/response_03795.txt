Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the variables.

* Distance = Distance = 60 miles
* Time = 1 hour
* Speed = Speed

We know that Speed = Distance / Time. We can use this formula to solve for the speed.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 60 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 60 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 60 mph

So, the speed limit was 60 mph.
