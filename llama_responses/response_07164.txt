Let's break it down step by step.

There are 21 consonants in the alphabet, and 1/7 of them are missing. To find the number of missing consonants, we can multiply 21 by 1/7:

21 * 1/7 = 3

So, 3 consonants are missing.

There are 5 vowels in the alphabet, so the total number of missing keys is:

3 (consonants) + 2 (vowels) = 5

Therefore, the total number of missing keys is 3 + 2 = 5.

Answer: 5
