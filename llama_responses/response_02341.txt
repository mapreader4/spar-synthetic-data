Let's break this problem down step by step.

Bill tosses more sticks into the river than Ted, so let's first figure out how many sticks Bill tosses. Bill tosses 6 more sticks than Ted, so Bill tosses 6 sticks. Ted tosses 10 sticks into the river, so let's add 10 to the total number of sticks. Bill tosses 6 sticks, so the total number of sticks is 6 + 10 = 16. Bill tosses 10 rocks into the river, so let's add 10 to the total number of objects. Bill tosses 6 sticks and 10 rocks into the river, so the total number of objects is 16 + 10 = 26. Bill tosses 6 sticks and 10 rocks into the river, so Bill tosses a total of 26 objects into the river.
