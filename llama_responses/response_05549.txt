Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of 4 pounds of coffee beans. 1 pound of coffee beans costs $2.50, so 4 pounds will cost 4 x 2.50 = $10.

Next, we need to find the cost of 2 gallons of milk. 1 gallon of milk costs $3.50, so 2 gallons will cost 2 x 3.50 = $7.

Now, we add the cost of the coffee beans and the cost of the milk together. $10 + $7 = $17.

So, Jasmine will pay $17.
