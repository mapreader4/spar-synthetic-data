Let's break this problem down step by step.

Paul runs 1 mile in 12 minutes. So, we can find the rate at which he runs:

1 mile / 12 minutes = 5 miles per hour

Paul watches two movies, each of which is 1.5 hours long. So, the total time spent watching movies is:

2 x 1.5 hours = 3 hours

Paul runs for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes / 1 hour = 180 minutes

Paul runs for 180 minutes. Since he runs 5 miles in 12 minutes, we can find the total distance he runs:

180 minutes / 12 minutes = 15

So, Paul runs 15 times the distance he runs in 12 minutes. But we know that he runs 1 mile in 12 minutes. So, the total distance he runs is:

15 * 1 mile = 15 miles

Answer: 15
