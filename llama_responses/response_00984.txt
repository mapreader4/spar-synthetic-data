Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of koalas. We know that each koala has 5 kangaroos. So, if we multiply the number of koalas by the number of kangaroos per koala, we can find the total number of kangaroos.

The number of koalas is given as 180, so we can multiply this by the number of kangaroos per koala, which is 5:

180 * 5 = 900

So, there are 900 kangaroos.

Now, to find the total number of koalas and kangaroos, we can add the number of koalas to the number of kangaroos:

180 (koalas) + 900 (kangaroos) = 1080

Answer: 1080
