To find the total amount he paid for the tickets, we can calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the service fee.

The total cost of the tickets is 44 dollars per person. Since there are 2 people, including Sebastian and his parents, the total cost of the tickets is 44 * 2 = 88 dollars.

The service fee is an additional 18 dollars. So, the total amount Sebastian paid for the tickets is 88 + 18 = 106 dollars.
