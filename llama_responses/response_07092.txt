Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that Jon's textbooks weigh three times as much as Brandon's textbooks, so if we let x be the weight of Brandon's textbooks, then Jon's textbooks will be 3x.

We are also given the weights of Jon's textbooks as 2, 8, and 9 pounds. So, we can write the equation 2 + 8 + 9 = 19. Since this is equal to 3x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get x = 19/3 = 6.33.

However, since the problem asks for an integer answer, we round 6.33 to the nearest integer, which is 6.

Answer: 6
