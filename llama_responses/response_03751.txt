Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The monkey swings from branch to branch at an average distance of 1.2 meters per second.
* The monkey swings consistently for 30 minutes.

To find the total distance, we need to multiply the average distance per second by the time in seconds.

1. Convert the time from minutes to seconds: 30 minutes = 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds

Now, multiply the average distance per second by the time in seconds: 1.2 meters/second * 1800 seconds = 2160 meters

Answer: 2160
