Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Jean has 3 grandchildren.
* Each grandchild receives 2 cards a year.
* Each card costs $80.

To find out how much Jean gives away to her grandchildren a year, we need to multiply the number of grandchildren by the number of cards each grandchild receives and the cost of each card.

The number of grandchildren is 3, the number of cards each grandchild receives is 2, and the cost of each card is $80.

So, we can multiply these values together to find the total amount Jean gives away to her grandchildren a year:

3 (number of grandchildren) x 2 (number of cards each grandchild receives) x $80 (cost of each card) = 3 x 2 x $80 = $160

So, the answer is:

Answer: 160
