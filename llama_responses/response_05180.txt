Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the total number of kids going to soccer camp is x.

Since half of the kids are going to soccer camp, that means 1,000 kids are going to soccer camp.

Now, since 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning, that means 250 kids are going to soccer camp in the morning.

To find the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon, we can subtract the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning from the total number of kids going to soccer camp. So, we subtract 250 from 1,000, which gives us:

1,000 - 250 = 750

Answer: 750
