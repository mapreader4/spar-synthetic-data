Let's start by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. We know that angle A is 60 degrees, so the sum of the other two angles must be 120 degrees. 

Let's let the angle B be x degrees. Then, we can set up the equation: 

60 + x + x = 120

We can subtract 60 from both sides to get: 

x + x = 60

We can then divide both sides by 2 to get: 

x = 30

So, the angle B is 30 degrees. 

Answer: 30
