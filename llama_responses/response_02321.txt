Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston.

So, Pete walked 5 blocks.

Step 2: Pete rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps.

So, Pete rode the bus 20 blocks.

Step 3: Later, he came home the same way.

So, Pete came back the same way, which means he walked 5 blocks back home.

Step 4: Add the blocks Pete walked and rode, we get:

5 + 20 = 25

Answer: 25
