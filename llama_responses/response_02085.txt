Let's break this down step by step.

Tom has a Super Nintendo worth $150. The store gives him 80% of that value, so he gets 0.8 x 150 = $120. He gives $80 to the store and gets back $10 change. The game he gets is worth $30. So the total amount Tom gets back is $120 - $80 + $10 = $50. But this is the value of the game, not the NES. So the value of the NES is $30. The NES was on sale for $30.
