Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the tomatoes. Mark bought 2 pounds of tomatoes for $5 per pound, so the cost of the tomatoes is 2 x 5 = 10 dollars.

Next, we need to find the cost of the apples. Mark bought 5 pounds of apples for $6 per pound, so the cost of the apples is 5 x 6 = 30 dollars.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tomatoes and the cost of the apples: 10 + 30 = 40.

So, the total amount Mark spent is 40 dollars.
