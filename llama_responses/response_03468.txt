Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Pepe is 4 feet 6 inches tall. 4 feet 6 inches is the same as 4.5 feet.

2. Frank is half a foot taller than Pepe, so Frank is 4.5 feet + 0.5 feet = 5 feet.

3. Larry is one foot taller than Frank, so Larry is 5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet.

4. Big Joe is one foot taller than Larry, so Big Joe is 6 feet + 1 foot = 7 feet.
