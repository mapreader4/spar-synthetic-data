Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Martha buys 1 latte for $4.00 every morning, 5 days a week, so she spends 5 x $4.00 = $20.00 per week on lattes.
2. 3 days a week, she buys an iced coffee for $2.00, so she spends 3 x $2.00 = $6.00 per week on iced coffee.
3. Total weekly coffee spending is $20.00 (lattes) + $6.00 (iced coffee) = $26.00.
4. To cut her spending by 25%, she needs to reduce her weekly spending by 25% of $26.00. 25% of $26.00 is $6.50.
5. So, Martha needs to reduce her spending by $6.50 per week.

Since Martha buys 52 weeks worth of coffee in a year, she will save $6.50 x 52 = $338.00 in a year.
