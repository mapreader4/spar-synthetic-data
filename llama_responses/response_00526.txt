Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Mack writes for 60 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 30 minutes, which means he writes 2 pages in total.

On Tuesday, Mack writes for 45 minutes at a rate of 1 page every 15 minutes, which means he writes 3 pages in total.

On Wednesday, Mack writes 5 pages.

To find the total number of pages written, I add the pages written on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.

Answer: 10
