Let's break this down step by step.

Tina saved $27 in June, so she has $27 left over from June.

Then, she saved $14 in July, so she has $27 - $14 = $13 left over from June and July.

Next, she saved $21 in August, so she has $13 - $21 = $8 left over from June and July and August.

Then, she spent $5 on books, so she has $8 - $5 = $3 left over.

Finally, she spent $17 on new shoes, so she has $3 - $17 = -$14 left.

So, Tina has $14 left.
