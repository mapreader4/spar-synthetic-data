Let's break this down step by step.

Let's let's say Phoebe's current age is 10 years. We know that Raven will be 4 times as old as Phoebe in 5 years. So, if Phoebe is 10 years old now, Raven will be 4 times 10 years old in 5 years. 

Let's calculate 4 times 10 years: 4 x 10 = 40.

So, Raven will be 40 years old in 5 years.

Answer: 40
