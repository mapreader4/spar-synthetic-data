Let's start by calculating the total cost of making all the pies.

Benny plans to make 10 pumpkin pies, which cost $3 each, so the total cost of making the pumpkin pies is 10 x $3 = $30.

He also plans to make 12 cherry pies, which cost $5 each, so the total cost of making the cherry pies is 12 x $5 = $60.

The total cost of making all the pies is the sum of the costs of making the pumpkin and cherry pies, which is $30 + $60 = $90.

Benny wants to make a profit of $20, so the total revenue from selling all the pies must be $90 + $20 = $110.

Since there are a total of 10 + 12 = 22 pies, the revenue per pie is $110 รท 22 = $5.
