Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* Jacob had 8 fish at the beginning.
* Alex caught 7 times as many fish as Jacob, so Alex caught 7 x 8 = 56 fish.
* Alex lost 23 fish back to the lake, so Alex now has 56 - 23 = 33 fish.
* Jacob needs to beat Alex by just 1 fish, so Jacob needs to have 1 more fish than Alex.

Now, let's find out how many fish Jacob needs to catch to beat Alex by 1 fish:

* Alex has 33 fish, and Jacob needs to have 1 more fish than Alex. So, Jacob needs to have 33 + 1 = 34 fish.
* Since Jacob started with 8 fish, he needs to catch 34 - 8 = 26 more fish to beat Alex by 1 fish.

Answer: 26
