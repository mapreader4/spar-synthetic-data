Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the number of cats that are spotted. We know that a third of the total number of cats are spotted. Let's call this number x.

x = (1/3) * 120

x = 40

Now, we know that a quarter of the spotted cats are fluffy. Let's call this number y.

y = (1/4) * 40

y = 10

Now, we know that the total number of spotted cats is 40, and the number of fluffy cats is 10. To find the total number of fluffy cats, we add the two numbers together:

40 + 10 = 50

Answer: 50
