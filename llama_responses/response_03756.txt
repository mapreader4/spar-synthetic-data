Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. The number of Doberman puppies is 20.
2. The number of Schnauzers is unknown.
3. The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is unknown.
4. Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3 x 20 = 60.
5. 5 less than 60 is 55.
6. The equation is: 55 = the number of Schnauzers.

So, the number of Schnauzers is 35.

Answer: 35
