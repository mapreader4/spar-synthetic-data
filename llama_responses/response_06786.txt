Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Sandy's current age is 12. Her goal is to grow her fingernails to 26 inches. She is currently 2 inches away from her goal. 

Sandy's fingernails grow at a rate of 1/10 of an inch per month. So, to grow 24 more inches, it will take her 24/10 = 2.4 months.

So, Sandy will be 12 + 2.4 = 14.4 years old when she achieves the world record. 

Answer: 14.4
