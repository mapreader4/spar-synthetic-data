Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the speed of the spacecraft is x miles per hour. 

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a time difference of 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

The distance from New Orleans to Dallas is 448 miles. 

The time it took for the first spacecraft to travel this distance is 448 / x = t, where t is the time in hours. 

The time it took for the second spacecraft to travel the same distance is t + 0.5 hours. 

We know that the first spacecraft landed at 3:30 pm, so the time it took for it to travel the distance is 3.5 hours. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

448 / x = 3.5 

x = 127.11

The speed of the first spacecraft is 127.11 miles per hour. 

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later, so it traveled for 3.25 hours. 

The time it took for the second spacecraft to travel the distance is 448 / x = 3.25. 

x = 137.5

The speed of the second spacecraft is 137.5 miles per hour. 

The difference in speed is 10.39 miles per hour.
