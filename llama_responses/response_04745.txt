Let's start by letting x be the number of stickers Jerry has. Since Jerry has three times as many stickers as George, we can set up the equation 3x = x. Then, George has 6 fewer stickers than Fred, so we can set up another equation as 3x - 6 = 18. We can then solve for x by adding 6 to both sides of the equation to get 3x = 24. Finally, we can divide both sides by 3 to get x = 8.
