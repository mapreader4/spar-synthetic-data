Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by counting the sheep. Mary thinks there are 7 sheep, but she double-counted them. So, she actually counted them 2 times, so the correct number of sheep is 7 / 2 = 3.5.

Now, let's move on to the pigs. Mary forgot to count 3 pigs. So, she didn't count them at all. We add the 3 pigs to the 3.5 sheep to get the total number of animals. 3.5 + 3 = 6.5.

So, Mary actually has 6.5 animals. However, we can't have a fraction of an animal, so we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 6.

Answer: 6
