Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the age of Dara in six years. Since Dara will be half the age of Jane in six years, and Jane is currently 28 years old, we can set up an equation to solve for Dara's age in six years. Let's call Dara's age in six years "x".

We know that Dara will be half the age of Jane in six years, so we can set up the equation as:

x = 28 / 2 = 14

We can simplify the right side of the equation to get:

x = 14

So, Dara's age in six years will be 14. To find the current age of Dara, we need to subtract 6 years from 14 to get:

Dara's current age = 14 - 6 = 8

So, Dara is currently 8 years old.

Since the minimum age required to be employed at the company is 25 years, we need to find the difference between Dara's current age and the minimum age required. We can do this by subtracting 8 (Dara's current age) from 25:

25 - 8 = 17

Answer: 17
