Let's break this down step by step.

Zayne started with 30 bracelets and made $60 from selling bracelets for $5 each. This means that the number of bracelets he sold is equal to the total amount of money he made divided by the price per bracelet.

Let's call the number of bracelets sold x. Then, we can set up the equation:

5x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 60 รท 5
x = 12

So Zayne sold 12 bracelets.

Now, to find the total amount of money he made, we can multiply the number of bracelets sold by the price per bracelet:

12 x 5 = 60

Answer: 60
