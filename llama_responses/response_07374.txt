Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of pumpkin pies. She baked 4 whole pumpkin pies.

She sold 1 whole pumpkin pie, so we subtract 1 from the total number of pumpkin pies, leaving us with 4 - 1 = 3.

She gave 1 whole pumpkin pie to her friend, so we subtract 1 from the remaining pumpkin pies, leaving us with 3 - 1 = 2.

The remaining pumpkin pies were each sliced into 6 pieces. So, 2 pumpkin pies were sliced into 6 pieces each, which means 2 x 6 = 12 pieces.

Her family ate 2/3 of the total 12 pieces. 2/3 of 12 is the same as 4/6, which means 4 pieces.

So, the number of pieces of pumpkin pie left is 12 - 4 = 8.
