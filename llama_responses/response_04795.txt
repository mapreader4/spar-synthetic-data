Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The bedrooms each take 20 minutes to clean, and there are 3 bedrooms, so the total time to clean the bedrooms is:

3 bedrooms x 20 minutes per bedroom = 60 minutes

2. The living room takes as long as the 3 bedrooms combined, so the time to clean the living room is:

60 minutes

3. The bathroom takes twice as long as the living room, so the time to clean the bathroom is:

60 minutes x 2 = 120 minutes

4. The total time to clean the house is:

60 minutes (bedrooms) + 60 minutes (living room) + 120 minutes (bathroom) = 240 minutes

5. The outside takes twice as long as cleaning the house, so the time to clean the outside is:

240 minutes x 2 = 480 minutes

6. James splits the chores with his 2 siblings, so the total time he works is:

240 minutes (house) + 480 minutes (outside) = 720 minutes

7. To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60:

720 minutes รท 60 = 12 hours

Answer: 12
