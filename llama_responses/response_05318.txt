Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the stay. The motel charges $280 per week, so for 3 months, it would be 3 x 280 = $840.

Since the motel offers a discount for longer stays, it charges $1000 per month. So, Casey will pay $1000 for the 12 weeks, or 4 months.

To find the amount saved, we need to subtract the 3-month stay cost from the 4-month stay cost:

$1000 - $840 = $160

So, Casey saves $160 by paying monthly.
