Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sean needs to replace 2 light bulbs in the bathroom and kitchen, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 bulbs.

He also needs to replace 4 bulbs in the basement.

And he needs to replace 1/2 of the amount in the garage. 1/2 of 4 is 2 bulbs.

So, in total, Sean needs 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 bulbs.

The bulbs come 2 per pack, so to find out how many packs he needs, we can divide the total number of bulbs by 2.

8 รท 2 = 4.

Sean needs 4 packs of light bulbs.
