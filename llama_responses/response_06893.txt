Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Convert the time taken by Samuel into minutes.
Samuel took 30 minutes to finish his homework, which is equivalent to 30 minutes.

Step 2: Convert the time taken by Sarah into minutes.
Sarah took 1.3 hours to finish her homework, which is equivalent to 80 minutes.

Step 3: Subtract the time taken by Sarah from the time taken by Samuel.
Sarah took 80 minutes, and Samuel took 30 minutes. To find the difference, subtract 80 - 30 = 50.

Answer: 50
