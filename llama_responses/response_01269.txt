To find the total revenue for the day, we need to calculate the total cost of the returns. The cost for a federal return is $50, the cost for a state return is $30, and the cost for a quarterly return is $80. The number of federal returns is 60, the number of state returns is 20, and the number of quarterly returns is 10.

The total revenue is the sum of the cost of the returns. So, the total revenue for the day is:

$50 * 60 + $30 * 20 + $80 * 10 = $30 * 60 + $80 * 10

$300 + $600 + $800 = $1800

The answer is: 1800.
