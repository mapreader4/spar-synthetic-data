Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Julia buys food for both the parrot and the rabbit for a total of $30 per week.
2. The rabbit has food for 5 weeks, and the parrot has food for 3 weeks.
3. The weekly cost of the rabbit food is $12, so for 5 weeks, the total cost of the rabbit food is 5 x $12 = $60.
4. The parrot has food for 3 weeks, so the total cost of the parrot food is 3 x (unknown cost per week) = 3x.
5. The total cost of food for both animals is $30, so the cost of the parrot food is $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 - $60 = $30 -
