Let the original price be P dollars. The reduced price is P - 50% = 0.5P. The sales tax is 5% of the reduced price, so it is 0.05(0.5P) = 0.025P. The total cost is the reduced price plus the sales tax, which is P - 0.5P + 0.025P = 0.025P. This can be written as P - 0.525. So the total cost is 0.525P. The problem asks for the total cost, which is 0.525P. So the answer is 0.525P.
