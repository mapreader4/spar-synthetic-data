Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mike buys 200 acres of land for $70 per acre. So the cost of the land is 200 x 70 = 14000 dollars.

2. He sold half of the acreage for $200 per acre. So he sold 100 acres of land for 100 x 200 = 20000 dollars.

3. The total profit he made is the difference between the cost of the land and the amount he sold it for: 20000 - 14000 = 6000.

Answer: 6000
