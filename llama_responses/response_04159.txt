Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the given information that it takes 120 days for a butterfly to become a butterfly. We know that the butterfly spends 3 times as much time as a larva as in a cocoon. So, let's say the time spent in a cocoon is x days. We can set up an equation based on this information:

120 = 3x

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 120 / 3
x = 40

So, each butterfly spends 40 days in a cocoon.
