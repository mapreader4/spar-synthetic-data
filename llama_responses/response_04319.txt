Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tammy has 10 orange trees, which means she can pick 10 x 12 = 120 oranges each day. 

Tammy sells 6-packs of oranges for $2 each, so she can make 120 / 6 = 20 packs of oranges each day. 

Since she sells 20 packs each day, she will sell 20 x 7 = 140 packs in a week. 

In 3 weeks, she will sell 140 x 3 = 420 packs. 

Each pack is worth $2, so she will earn 420 x 2 = 840 dollars. 

Answer: 840
