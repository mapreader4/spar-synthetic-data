Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information given that the house has a total area of 2,300 sq ft.

The guest bedroom is a quarter of the size of the master bedroom suite, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the size of the master bedroom suite. Then, the guest bedroom will be 1/4 of x.

We can set up the equation as follows:

x + (1/4x) = 2,300 - 1,000

To solve for x, we can add 1,000 to both sides of the equation to get:

x + (1/4x + 1,000) = 2,300

Now, we can subtract 1,000 from both sides of the equation to get:

1/4x = 1,300

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get:

x = 1,300 * 4

x = 5,200

Answer: 5,200
