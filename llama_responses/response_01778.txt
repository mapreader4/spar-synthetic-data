Let's break it down step by step.

Dorothy spent $53 to buy doughnut ingredients.
She made 25 doughnuts.
Each doughnut sells for $3.

So, to find her profit, we need to subtract the cost of the ingredients from the total revenue.

Cost of ingredients: $53.
Revenue: 25 * 3 = 75.

Profit = Revenue - Cost = 75 - 53 = 22.

Answer: 22
