Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. We know that the company needs 1.5 grams of sugar for every chocolate bar.
2. The company produces 36 chocolate bars in one minute.
3. So, in one minute, the company will use 1.5 * 36 = 54 grams of sugar.
4. Since the company produces chocolate bars for 2 minutes, it will use 2 * 54 = 108 grams of sugar.

Answer: 108
