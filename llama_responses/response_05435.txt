Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Convert the given percentage to a decimal. 80% is 0.8 in decimal form.

Step 2: Calculate the daily protein intake. 2 grams per kilogram of body weight is the daily protein intake. 80 kg is the body weight. So, the daily protein intake is 2 * 80 = 160 grams.

Step 3: Calculate the weekly protein intake. 7 days in a week, so the weekly protein intake is 7 * 160 = 1120 grams.

Answer: 1120
