Let's break it down step by step.

The total cost of the system is $20,000.  This includes the cost of 2 conditioning zones, each with 5 vents.  To find the cost per vent, we need to divide the total cost by the number of vents.

Cost per vent = Total cost / Number of vents
= 20000 / 10
= 2000

Answer: 2000
