Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first identify the given information:

1. Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, which means the total cost of the soft drinks is 2 x 4 = 8 dollars.
2. Benny also bought 5 candy bars, and the total cost of the candy bars is not given.
3. The total amount of money spent is 28 dollars, which is the sum of the cost of the soft drinks and the cost of the candy bars.

Now, let's set up an equation based on the information:

Let x be the cost of each candy bar. Then, the total cost of the candy bars is 5x. The total cost of the soft drinks and the candy bars combined is 8 + 5x = 28.

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

8 + 5x = 28

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

5x = 20

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 20 / 5

x = 4

So, the cost of each candy bar is 4 dollars.
