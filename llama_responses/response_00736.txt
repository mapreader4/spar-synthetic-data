Let's break it down step by step.

Hilary bought 3 samosas at $2 each, so the cost of the samosas is 3 * 2 = 6 dollars. She also bought 4 orders of pakoras at $3 each, so the cost of the pakoras is 4 * 3 = 12 dollars. The cost of the mango lassi is $2. So, the total cost of the food items is 6 + 12 + 2 = 20 dollars. The tip is 25% of the total cost, so the tip is 0.25 * 20 = 5 dollars. The total cost, with the tip, is 20 + 5 = 25 dollars.

Answer: 25
