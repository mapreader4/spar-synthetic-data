Let's break this problem down step by step.

Tony can lift 90 pounds in the curl exercise. In the military press, he can lift twice the weight he can curl, so he can lift 2 x 90 = 180 pounds in the military press.

In the squat exercise, he can squat 5 times the weight he can lift in the military press, so he can squat 5 x 180 = 900 pounds.

Answer: 900
