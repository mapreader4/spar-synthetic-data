Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Mark played 20 minutes initially.
2. Then, he rested for some time.
3. He then played for another 35 minutes.
4. The total time he was on the field is the sum of the time he played initially and the time he played after the rest.

We can find the total time he was on the field by adding 20 minutes and 35 minutes.

20 + 35 = 55

Answer: 55
