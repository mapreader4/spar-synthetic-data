Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Rodney gets a commission of $25 for each system he sells. We also know that the total commission was $175. We also know that the first street gave him half the sales that the second street did, so let's call the number of sales on the second street "x".

The first street gave him half the sales of the second street, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

0.5x = x

We know that the total commission was $175, so we can set up another equation to represent this:

0.5x + x + (x) = 175

We can subtract 0.5x from both sides of the equation to get:

x + x = 175 - 0.5x

We can then subtract x from both sides to get:

x = 175 - 0.5x - x

Since Rodney sold only one system on the fourth street, we know that the total number of sales was 1 + x. We can substitute this into the equation:

x + 1 = 175 - 0.5x - x

We can then solve for x by subtracting 175 from both sides:

x = 174 - 0.5x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by -0.5:

x / -0.5 = 174 - x

x = 348

So, Rodney sold 348 / 0.5 = 696 systems on the second street.
