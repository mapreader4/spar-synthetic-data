Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "Mike has three times as many cookies as Millie." This means that if Millie has 4 cookies, Mike has 4 * 3 = 12 cookies.

Now, the problem says that Frank has "three less than half the number of cookies as Mike". Since Mike has 12 cookies, half of 12 is 6. So, Frank has 12 - 3 = 9 cookies.
