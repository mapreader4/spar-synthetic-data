Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's calculate the amount of water that fills the pool in each hour:

* Hour 1: 8 gallons
* Hour 2-3: 10 gallons x 2 = 20 gallons
* Hour 4: 14 gallons
* Hour 5: 14 - 8 = 6 gallons (because 8 gallons were lost due to the leak)

To find the total amount of water that fills the pool, we add up the gallons from each hour:

8 + 20 + 14 + 6 = 48

So, 48 gallons of water fill the pool.
