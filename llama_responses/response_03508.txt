Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hour to drive to work in the morning.
2. He takes 1.5 hours to drive back home in the evening.
3. The morning and evening traffic is similar.
4. He drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning.

We want to find the average speed of his return journey.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Mr. Maxwell drives in the morning:

1 hour = 60 minutes = 30 miles (since 1 hour = 60 minutes, and 1 hour = 60 minutes)

Step 2: Calculate the distance Mr. Maxwell drives in the evening:

1.5 hours = 90 minutes = 45 miles (since 1.5 hours = 90 minutes, and 1 hour = 60 minutes, so 1.5 hours = 1.5 * 60 = 90)

Step 3: Since the morning and evening traffic is similar, the distance driven in the morning and evening is the same. Therefore, the distance driven in the evening is also 30 miles.

Step 4: Calculate the average speed of the return journey:

Total distance driven in the evening = 30 miles
Time taken in the evening = 1.5 hours
Average speed = Total distance / Time = 30 miles / 1.5 hours = 20 mph
