Let's start by identifying the information given. The problem states that "six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan". This means that the number of ducks at Lake Michigan is 6x2, or 12. Since we know that Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of ducks at North Pond. 

Let's do that now.

Let x be the number of ducks at North Pond. Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

x = 6x2

We know that 6x2 is 12, so we can substitute 12 for x:

x = 12

So, the number of ducks at North Pond is 12.
