Let's think step by step.

Let's say the number of cards in the box is x.

Sasha added 48 cards, so the new total number of cards is x + 48.

Then, Karen took out 1/6 of the cards, which is 1/6 × (x + 48). So, the new total number of cards is x + 48 - 1/6 × (x + 48).

We know that the new total number of cards is 83. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 48 - 1/6 × (x + 48) = 83.

We can solve for x by subtracting 48 from both sides of the equation:

x + 48 - 1/6 × (x + 48) = 83

Subtracting 48 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x - 1/6 × (x + 48) = 35

Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to get rid of the fraction:

6(x - 1/6 × (x + 48)) = 210

This simplifies to:

6x - x - 48 = 210

Adding 48 to both sides of the equation gives us:

6x - x = 258

Adding x to both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 258 + x = 258

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 0

So, the original number of cards in the box is 0 + 48 = 48.

Answer: 48
