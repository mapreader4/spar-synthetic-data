Let's break down the information step by step.

Let's say the kindergarten library bought 2 models, and the elementary library bought 2 x 2 = 4 models. So the total number of models is 6.

The school bought more than 5 models, so the reduction is 5%. The reduction is on each model, so the total reduction is 5% of 6 models, which is 0.3 models.

The total price for the 6 models is 6 * 100 = 600. The reduction is 0.3 models, so the final price is 600 - 0.3 * 100 = 600 - 30 = 570.

The school paid 570 dollars.
