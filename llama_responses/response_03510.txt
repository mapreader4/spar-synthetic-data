Let's break down the problem step by step:

Alfred wants to save $1,000.00 over 12 months, but he has $100.00 left over from last year's holiday to put towards this year's goal. This means he already has a head start of $100.00.

To find out how much he needs to save each month, we need to subtract the $100.00 from the total amount he wants to save. So, the amount he needs to save is:

$1,000.00 - $100.00 = $900.00

Since he wants to save this amount in 12 months, we need to divide the amount by 12:

$900.00 รท 12 = $75.00

So, Alfred needs to save $75.00 each month to reach his goal in 12 months.
