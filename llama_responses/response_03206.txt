To find the amount of money the company will earn, we need to calculate the total number of computers produced in a week and multiply it by the price per computer.

A week has 7 days. Since the factory produces 1500 computers per day, the total number of computers produced in a week is:

1500 * 7 = 10500

The company sells each computer for 150 dollars. To find the total amount of money earned, we multiply the total number of computers by the price per computer:

10500 * 150 = 157500

Answer: 157500
