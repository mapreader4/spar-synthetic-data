Let's start by identifying the amount of water that the cask can store. The problem states that the cask stores 20 gallons, and the barrels store 3 gallons more than twice as much as the cask. So, the barrels store 20 * 2 = 40 gallons. Since there are 4 barrels, we can subtract 4 * 3 = 12 gallons from 40 gallons. So, the total amount of water James can store is 40 - 12 = 28 gallons.
