Let's break down the problem step by step.

The elevator needs to move down 20 floors in total. It takes 15 minutes to travel down the first half of the floors, which is 10 floors (since 20/2 = 10). This means the remaining 10 floors need to be traveled.

The elevator then takes 5 minutes per floor to travel down the next 5 floors. This takes a total of 5 x 5 = 25 minutes.

The elevator then takes 16 minutes per floor to finish traveling down the final 5 floors. This takes a total of 5 x 16 = 80 minutes.

In total, the elevator took 15 minutes + 25 minutes + 80 minutes = 120 minutes to reach the bottom.

To convert this to hours, we can divide the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes รท 60 = 2 hours
