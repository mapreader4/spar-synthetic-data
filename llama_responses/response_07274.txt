Let's break this down step by step:

1. 20% of the job candidates have experience with Excel. Let's denote this as 0.2.

2. 70% of the candidates are willing to work day shifts. Let's denote this as 0.7.

3. We want to find the probability that the manager picks a candidate who knows Excel and is willing to work nights. This is a conditional probability problem, so we need to multiply the two probabilities together.

4. The probability that the candidate knows Excel is 0.2.

5. The probability that the candidate is willing to work nights is 0.7.

6. We multiply the two probabilities together to get 0.2 x 0.7 = 0.14.
