Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, let's find out how many doughnuts the bakery has in total. Each box has 10 doughnuts, and they sold 27 boxes. So, they sold a total of:

27 boxes x 10 doughnuts per box = 270 doughnuts

The bakery made a total of 300 doughnuts. To find out how many doughnuts they have left, we subtract the number of doughnuts they sold from the total number of doughnuts they made:

300 doughnuts - 270 doughnuts = 30 doughnuts

So, the bakery has 30 doughnuts left at the end of the day. Since they give away any leftover doughnuts, the answer is:

Answer: 30
