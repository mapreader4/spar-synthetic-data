Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the amount of federal taxes removed from Bobby's paycheck. 1/3 of $450 is:

$450 x 1/3 = $150

Next, we need to calculate the amount of state taxes removed from Bobby's paycheck. 8% of $450 is:

$450 x 0.08 = $36

Now, let's add the federal and state taxes together to get the total amount of taxes removed:

$150 + $36 = $186

Next, we need to subtract the health insurance payment, life insurance payment, and city fee from the paycheck:

$450 - $50 - $20 - $10 = $370

Finally, we need to subtract the total amount of taxes from the paycheck:

$370 - $186 = $184

Answer: 184
