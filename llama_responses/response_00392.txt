Let's break this down step by step.

First, the clothes take 30 minutes to wash. The towels take 60 minutes to wash, because they take twice as long as the clothes. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels, so they take 45 minutes to wash. 

The total time for washing the clothes, towels, and sheets is 30 + 60 + 45 = 135 minutes.

Answer: 135
