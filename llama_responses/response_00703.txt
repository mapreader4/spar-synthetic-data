To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many avocados Georgie has in total.

Georgie already has 5 avocados. Her sister buys 4 more, so Georgie has a total of 5 + 4 = 9 avocados.

Since Georgie needs 3 avocados to make her grandmother's guacamole recipe, we can divide the total number of avocados by 3 to find out how many servings she can make.

9 avocados divided by 3 is 9 รท 3 = 3.

Answer: 3
