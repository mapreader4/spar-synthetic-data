Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Saheed made x dollars.

Since Kayla made four times as much money as Saheed, Kayla made 4x dollars.

We know that Kayla made $30 less than Vika. So, Vika made 84 + 30 = 114 dollars.

Since Kayla made 4x, and Vika made 114, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

4x = 114 - 30

x = 84

So, Saheed made 84 dollars.
