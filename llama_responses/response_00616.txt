Let's break down the time into smaller parts. The first 15 minutes, Kris and her brother blow up balloons at a rate of 2 balloons per minute. That means they blow up a total of 15 * 2 = 30 balloons. Then, after 15 minutes, Kris's brother doubles his speed and they blow up balloons at a rate of 2 * 2 = 4 balloons per minute. They blow up balloons for 15 minutes, so they blow up a total of 15 * 4 = 60 balloons. In total, they blow up 30 + 60 = 90 balloons. Answer: 90
