Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the total number of bottles Don can buy from all shops.

Shop A sells 150 bottles, shop B sells 180 bottles, so together, Don can buy 150 + 180 = 330 bottles.

Step 2: We know that Don can buy 550 bottles in total. So, the number of bottles he buys from shop C is the difference between the total bottles he can buy and the number of bottles he buys from shops A and B.

550 - 330 = 220.

Answer: 220
