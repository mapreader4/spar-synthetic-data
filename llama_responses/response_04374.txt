Let's break this problem down step by step.

Phoebe eats 1 serving and gives her dog 1 serving of peanut butter for a bedtime snack. So, for every day, Phoebe and her dog will need 2 servings of peanut butter. 

There are 30 days in a month. So, the total number of servings needed is 2 servings per day x 30 days = 60.

Each jar of peanut butter has 15 servings. So, we need to find out how many jars she will need to make sure she and her dog have enough peanut butter for 60 servings. 

To find the number of jars needed, we divide 60 servings by 15 servings per jar. 

60 servings / 15 servings per jar = 4 jars.
