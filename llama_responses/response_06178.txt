Let's break this down step by step.

Ibrahim has 55 euros in savings. He spends 20 euros, so he has 55 - 20 = 35 euros left.

He wants to buy an MP3 player for 120 euros and a CD for 19 euros. The total cost is 120 + 19 = 139 euros.

Ibrahim has 35 euros, which is less than the 139 euros he needs. He lacks 139 - 35 = 104 euros.

Answer: 104
