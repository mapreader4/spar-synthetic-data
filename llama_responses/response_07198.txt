Let's start by letting x be the number of marbles Stuart had initially.

We know that after Betty gave Stuart 40% of her marble collection, the number of marbles in Stuart's collection increased to 80. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 0.4x = 80

We can then solve for x by subtracting 0.4x from both sides of the equation:

x - 0.4x = 80 - 0.4x

x = 80 / 0.6

x = 133.33

Since we cannot have a fraction of a marble, we can round this number to the nearest integer. The closest integer to 133.33 is 133.

So, Stuart initially had 133 marbles.
