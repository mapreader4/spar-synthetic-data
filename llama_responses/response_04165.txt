Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the pattern of how many sandwiches Paul eats on each day.

Day 1: Paul eats 2 sandwiches.
Day 2: Paul doubles the number of sandwiches from the first day, so he eats 2 * 2 = 4 sandwiches.
Day 3: Paul doubles the number of sandwiches from the second day, so he eats 4 * 2 = 8 sandwiches.

Now, we want to know how many sandwiches Paul would eat if he studied for 6 days in a row.

Let's add up the number of sandwiches Paul would eat on each day.

Day 1: 2 sandwiches
Day 2: 4 sandwiches
Day 3: 8 sandwiches
Day 4: Paul doubles the number of sandwiches from the previous day, so he eats 8 * 2 = 16 sandwiches.
Day 5: Paul doubles the number of sandwiches from the previous day, so he eats 16 * 2 = 32 sandwiches.
Day 6: Paul doubles the number of sandwiches from the previous day, so he eats 32 * 2 = 64 sandwiches.

So, if Paul studied for 6 days, he would eat 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 76 sandwiches.

Answer: 76
