Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first identify the given information.

* 10% of their output is nickel.
* 60% of their output is iron.
* The rest is copper.

We are given that the total output is 100% of the three types of ore. So, the total output is 100%. So, let's set up an equation.

Let's say the total output is 100% of the three types of ore. We know that 10% is nickel, 60% is iron, and the rest is copper. So, we can set up an equation like this:

10% + 60% + (100 - 10% - 60%) = 30%

The 30% is the copper. So, to find the copper, we can multiply the total output by 30% to get the copper.

30% of 720 tons is 216 tons.

Answer: 216
