Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the amount of milk each cow produces:

* Bess produces 2 pails of milk per day
* Brownie produces 3 times that amount, so Brownie produces 2 x 3 = 6 pails of milk per day
* Daisy produces 1 pail more than Bess, so Daisy produces 2 + 1 = 3 pails of milk per day

Now, let's find the total amount of milk produced by each cow per day:
* Bess: 2 pails
* Brownie: 6 pails
* Daisy: 3 pails

To find the total amount of milk produced per day, we add the amount of milk produced by each cow: 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 pails

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7:
11 pails/day Ã— 7 days = 77 pails

Answer: 77
