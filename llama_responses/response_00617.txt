Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the base fine for speeding, which is $50.

Next, we need to calculate the additional penalties for the speed. Mark was going 45 miles per hour over the speed limit, which is 30 miles per hour. To find the additional fine, we multiply the number of miles per hour he was going over the speed limit by the fine for speeding, which is $2 per mile. So, the additional fine is 45 x 2 = $90.

The fine is doubled because he was in a school zone, so we multiply the fine by 2 again. The fine is now 90 + 90 = $180.

The judge also makes Mark pay $300 in court costs, and he has to pay his lawyer $80 for three hours of work. So, we add these to the total fine. 180 + 300 + 240 = $720.

So, Mark owes a total of $720 for his speeding ticket.
