Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the amount Gina would tip if she is a good tipper. Since she tips at least 20%, she would tip 20% of the bill, which is 0.2 x 26 = 5.2.

Now, to find out how many more cents Gina would need to tip to be considered a good tipper, we need to subtract 5% from 5.2. 5.2 - 5 = 0.2.

So, Gina would need to tip 0.2 more cents to be considered a good tipper.
