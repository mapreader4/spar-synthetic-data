Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

* Christine picked 10 pounds of strawberries.
* Rachel picked twice as much as Rachel. If Rachel picked x pounds, then Christine picked 2x pounds of strawberries.
* The total amount of strawberries picked by both Christine and Rachel is 10 + 2x pounds.

We need to find the total amount of strawberries needed to make a pie, which is 3 pounds per pie. Let's set up an equation to represent this.

Let x be the number of pies that can be made.

3x = 10 + 2x

We can solve for x by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 10 + 2x
3x - 10 = 2x

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

x = (2x) / 1
x = 5

So, the number of pies they can make is 5.
