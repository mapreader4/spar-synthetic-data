To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total distance Lexi wants to run, which is 3 and one-fourth miles. This can be written as 3.25 miles.

Next, we need to convert the total distance into laps. To do this, we need to find out how many times a quarter of a mile is in 3.25 miles.

To do this, we can divide 3.25 by a quarter, which is the same as dividing by 0.25. When we do this, we get:

3.25 รท 0.25 = 13

So, Lexi needs to run 13 laps.
