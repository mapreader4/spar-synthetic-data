To find the number of large pizzas sold, we can first find the number of small pizzas sold and then subtract that from the total pizzas sold.

Let's say the number of small pizzas sold is x. Then, the number of large pizzas sold is 40 - x.

We know that the number of small pizzas sold is 8, so we can set up an equation: 8 = x. We can solve this equation to find that x = 32. This means that the number of large pizzas sold is 32.

Answer: 32
