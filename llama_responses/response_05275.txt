Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Bert has 4x stamps. Ernie has 3x stamps. We know Peggy has 75 stamps. We can write an equation to represent this information.

Bert's stamps = 4x
Ernie's stamps = 3x
Peggy's stamps = 75

We can represent this as an equation:

4x = 3x + 75

We can subtract 3x from both sides to get:

x = (3x + 75)/3
x = 25

So Peggy needs to add 25 stamps to her collection to have a collection as large as Bert's collection.
