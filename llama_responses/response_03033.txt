Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the distances traveled by the lawn chair and the birdhouse:

* The lawn chair was blown twice as far as the car was transported, and the car was transported 200 feet. So, the lawn chair was blown 200 x 2 = 400 feet.
* The birdhouse flew through the air three times farther than the lawn chair had been blown. Since the lawn chair was blown 400 feet, the birdhouse flew 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

So, the birdhouse flew 1200 feet.

Answer: 1200
