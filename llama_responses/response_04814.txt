Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Mindy has 7 less than 9 times as many emails as phone messages. We can represent this as the equation 9x - 7 = 93, where x is the number of emails. We need to isolate the number of emails, which is the variable x.

To do this, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation to get 9x = 100. Then, we can divide both sides by 9 to get x = 100/9, which is x = 11.

Answer: 11
