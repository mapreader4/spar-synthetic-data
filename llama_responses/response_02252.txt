Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's assume Mary and Jimmy start from the same point, so the distance between them is initially 0 miles. Then, Mary runs at a rate of 5 miles per hour and Jimmy runs at a rate of 4 miles per hour.

After 1 hour, Mary will have run a distance of 5 miles and Jimmy will have run a distance of 4 miles.

So, the distance between them will be the sum of the distances they have run. That is, 5 + 4 = 9 miles.

Answer: 9
