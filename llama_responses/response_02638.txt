Let's start by letting x be the number of cents Sarah has. We know that Bridge and Sarah together have 3 dollars, which is 300 cents. We can write this as the equation 3x + 50 = 300. To solve for x, we can subtract 50 from both sides of the equation to get 3x = 250. To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 3, which gives us x = 250/3 = 83.33. But since the question asks for the number of cents, which is an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, the number of cents Sarah has is 83.
