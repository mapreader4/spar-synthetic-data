Let's break it down step by step.

Mark reads 2 hours each day. To find the total time he reads in a day, we multiply 2 hours by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, Mark reads 2 * 7 = 14 hours per week.

He wants to increase his time spent on reading books by 4 hours. So, we add 4 hours to his total weekly reading time. 14 + 4 = 18.

Answer: 18
