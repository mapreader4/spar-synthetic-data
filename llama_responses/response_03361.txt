Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the difference in their ages.

Agnes is 25 years old, and Jane is 6 years old. To find the difference in their ages, we subtract 25 - 6 = 19.

So, Agnes is 19 years older than Jane.

To find in how many years Agnes will be twice as old as Jane, we need to multiply 19 by 2.

19 * 2 = 38.

So, Agnes will be 38 years old when she is twice as old as Jane.
