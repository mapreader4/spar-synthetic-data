Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of papayas Jake can eat in one week, which is the total of the number of papayas his brother and his father can eat in one week, which is 3 + 5 + 4 = 8 papayas.

Since Jake can eat 3 papayas in one week, and his brother can eat 5 papayas in one week, his father can eat 4 papayas in one week, the total number of papayas they can eat in one week is 3 + 5 + 4 = 8 papayas.

To account for 4 weeks, we need to multiply the total number of papayas they can eat in one week by 4, which is 8 * 4 = 32 papayas.

So, Jake needs to buy 32 papayas from the farmer's market.
