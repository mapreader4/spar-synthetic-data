Let's break it down step by step.

Patsy needs 6 appetizers per guest, and she has 30 guests. To find the total number of appetizers she needs, we multiply 6 by 30, which gives us 180 appetizers.

She's making 3 dozen deviled eggs, which is 36, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, which is 24, and 2 dozen kebabs, which is 24. So in total, she's making 36 + 24 + 24 = 84 appetizers.

To find out how many more she needs to make, we subtract the number of appetizers she's making from the total number she needs, which is 180 - 84 = 96. 

Answer: 96
