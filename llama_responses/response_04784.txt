Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information.

* The number of lions is 200.
* The number of leopards is twice the number of lions.
* The number of elephants is half the combined number of lions and leopards.

Let's denote the number of lions as L, the number of leopards as 2L, and the number of elephants as E.

We know that L = 200, so we can substitute this value into the equations to solve for E and 2L.

The number of elephants is half the combined number of lions and leopards, so we can set up the equation E = (L + 2L)/2.

We know that L = 200, so we can substitute this value into the equation.

E = (200 + 2(200))/2

E = (200 + 400)/2

E = 300

The total population of the three animals in the park is the sum of the number of lions, leopards, and elephants.

The total population is L + 2L + E.

The total population is 200 + 400 + 300.

The answer is:

Answer: 900
