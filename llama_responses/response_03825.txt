Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 37 jellybeans in the jar.

1. Pat removed 15 jellybeans. So, there are 37 - 15 = 22 jellybeans left in the jar.

2. Pat added 5 of the removed jellybeans back in. So, there are now 22 + 5 = 27 jellybeans in the jar.

3. Then, Pat removed 4 more jellybeans. So, there are 27 - 4 = 23 jellybeans in the jar.

Answer: 23
