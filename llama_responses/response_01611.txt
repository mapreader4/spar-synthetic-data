Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the first day, where they traveled 200 miles.

Then, on the second day, they traveled 3/4 as far as the first day. So, they traveled 200 * 3/4 = 150 miles.

Now, for the third day, they traveled 1/2 as many miles as the first two days combined. The first two days, they traveled 200 + 150 = 350 miles. So, they traveled 1/2 * 350 = 175 miles on the third day.

To find the total number of miles traveled for 3 days, we add up the miles for each day:

200 + 150 + 175 = 525

Answer: 525
