To find the total number of people carried by the bus system in 13 weeks, we can multiply the number of people carried each day by the number of days in 13 weeks.

The number of people carried each day is 1,200,000. The number of days in 13 weeks is 13.

So, we multiply 1,200,000 by 13 to get the total number of people carried in 13 weeks.

1,200,000 x 13 = 15,600,000

Answer: 15,600,000
