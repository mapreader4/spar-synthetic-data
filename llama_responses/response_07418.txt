To solve this problem, I will assume that each cap weighs one ounce. 

Let's say the total weight of the caps is 18 pounds. 

We know that 7 caps weigh one ounce, so the total weight of 1 cap is 1 ounce. 

If we divide 18 pounds by 1 ounce, we get the total number of caps. 

18 / 1 = 18 

Answer: 18
