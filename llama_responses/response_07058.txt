Let's break this down step by step.

Nellie played with her 6 sisters and her 8 brothers in hide and seek, so that's 6 + 8 = 14 kids.

Then, she played with all 22 of her cousins, which is an additional 22 kids.

To find the total number of kids Nellie played with, we add 14 and 22 together: 14 + 22 = 36.

So, Nellie played with 36 kids in total.
