Let's break it down step by step.

The recipe book cost $6. The baking dish cost twice as much as the recipe book, so it cost 2 * 6 = $12. The five ingredients cost $3 each, so that is 5 * 3 = $15. The apron cost a dollar more than the recipe book, so it cost 6 + 1 = $7.

Adding all the costs together, Liz spent 6 + 12 + 15 + 7 = $34. So the answer is:
