Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jonathan eats 2500 calories every day, except for Saturday, when he consumes an extra 1000 calories.  So, on Saturday, he consumes 2500 + 1000 = 3500 calories.  On all other days, he consumes 2500 calories.  So, his average daily caloric intake is (2500 + 2500 + 3500)/7 = 2750 calories.

2. Jonathan burns 3000 calories every day.  This is his daily caloric expenditure.

3. To find his weekly caloric deficit, we need to subtract his weekly caloric intake from his weekly caloric expenditure.  7 * 2750 = 19250 calories for his daily caloric intake and 7 * 3000 = 21000 calories for his daily caloric expenditure.  His weekly caloric deficit is 21000 - 19250 = 17050 calories.

Answer: 17050
