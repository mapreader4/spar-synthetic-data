Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many customers the Sandwich Shop serves in an 8-hour day. Since they serve a sandwich every 5 minutes, we can find the total number of minutes in an 8-hour day:

60 minutes/hour * 8 hours = 480 minutes

Now, we can divide the total number of minutes by 5 (the time it takes to serve a sandwich):

480 minutes / 5 minutes/sandwich = 96 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 4 strips of jalapeno pepper. Since each jalapeno pepper makes 8 slices, we can find the total number of jalapeno peppers required:

96 sandwiches * 4 strips/sandwich = 384 strips

Now, we can divide the total number of strips by 8 (the number of slices per jalapeno pepper):

384 strips / 8 slices/jalapeno = 48 jalapeno peppers

Answer: 48
