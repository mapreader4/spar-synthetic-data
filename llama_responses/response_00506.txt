Let's break it down step by step.

Let's find the total distance Terese runs on each of the days.

Monday, Terese runs 4.2 miles.
Tuesday, Terese runs 3.8 miles.
Wednesday, Terese runs 3.6 miles.
Thursday, Terese runs 4.4 miles.

To find the average distance Terese runs on each of the days, we need to add up the distance she runs on each day and then divide by the number of days.

Let's add up the distance:

4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 11.6

There are 4 days. So, to find the average, we divide the total distance by 4:

11.6 / 4 = 2.9

Answer: 2.9
