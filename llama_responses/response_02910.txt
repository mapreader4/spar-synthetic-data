To find the number of passengers that step on and off a train at the station within an hour, we need to find the total number of passengers that step on and off the train within the 60 minutes.

The train leaves the station every 5 minutes, so it leaves the station 12 times in an hour. The number of passengers that leave the station is 12 x 200 = 2400. The number of passengers that board the train is 12 x 320 = 3840.

So, the total number of passengers that step on and off the train at the station within an hour is 2400 + 3840 = 6240.

Answer: 6240
