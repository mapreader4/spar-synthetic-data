Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's start by identifying how much Orlando gained weight.  Orlando gained 5 pounds.
2. Jose gained 2 pounds more than Orlando gained, so Jose gained 5 + 2 = 7 pounds.
3. Fernando gained 3 pounds less than half of what Jose gained, which is 7 / 2 = 3.5 pounds less 3.5 = 3 pounds.
4. So, the total amount of weight gained is Orlando's 5 pounds + Jose's 7 pounds + Fernando's 3 pounds = 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 pounds.
