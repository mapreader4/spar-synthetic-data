To find the number of hours Alani needs to baby-sit to earn $75, we can set up a proportion. We know that Alani earns $45 for 3 hours of baby-sitting. So, we can set up the proportion as follows:

$\frac{45}{3} = \frac{x}{x}$

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:

$\frac{45}{3} = \frac{x}{x} * 15$

This gives us:

x = 75

So, Alani needs to baby-sit for 75 hours to earn $75.
