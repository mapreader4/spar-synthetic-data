Let's break down the cost of each item:

Sonja: $3 for the bread, $23 for the platter of cold cuts, so total cost for Sonja is $3 + $23 = $26.

Barbara: $1 for the soda for each person, so for 5 people, she will spend $5. She will also buy 2 boxes of crackers for $2 each, so total cost for Barbara is $5 + $4 = $9.

Mario and Rick will split the cost of 2 packages of Cheese Doodles for $3 each, so the total cost for them is $6. This will be split between the two of them, so each will spend $3.

Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4.

The total cost for the rest of the office is $26 + $9 + $6 = $41.

Sonja will spend $26, which is $15 more than the rest of the office.
