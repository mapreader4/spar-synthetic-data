Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of fireflies that danced initially. We are told that there were three fireflies that danced initially.

Then, we are told that they were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies. "A dozen" means 12, so we can say that the total number of fireflies that joined the three initial fireflies is 12 - 3 = 9.

Now, we are told that two of the fireflies flew away. We can subtract 2 from the total number of fireflies, which is 9, to get 9 - 2 = 7.

So, the number of fireflies that remained is 7.

Answer: 7
