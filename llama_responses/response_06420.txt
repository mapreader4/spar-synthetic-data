Let's break down Rich's route step by step.

1. Rich walks 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.
2. Then, he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road.
3. So, his total distance so far is 20 + 200 = 220 feet.
4. Then, he makes a left and walks double his total distance so far, which is 2 x 220 = 440 feet.
5. His new total distance is 220 + 440 = 660 feet.
6. Then, he walks half the total distance up to this point, which is 660 / 2 = 330 feet.
7. His final total distance is 660 + 330 = 990 feet.
8. Since he walks the same path all the way back home, his total distance is doubled to 990 x 2 = 1980 feet.

Answer: 1980
