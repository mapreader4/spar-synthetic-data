Let's break this down step by step.

Jan starts with 65 gallons of water. She uses 7 gallons for the cars, so she has 65 - 7 = 58 gallons left.

Then, she uses 11 fewer gallons than the two cars to water the plants, so she uses 7 gallons for the plants. 7 gallons for the plants, so she has 58 - 7 = 51 gallons left.

Then, she uses half of the remaining gallons of water to wash the plates and clothes. Half of 51 is 25.5, but we can't use decimal numbers, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 25.

So, Jan uses 25 gallons to wash her plates and clothes.
