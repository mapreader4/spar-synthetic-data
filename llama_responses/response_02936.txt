Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of blue and red cars. We know that one-third of the total number of cars are blue, so we can find the number of blue cars by multiplying the total number of cars by 1/3:

516 cars * 1/3 = 172 cars

We know that one-half of the total number of cars are red, so we can find the number of red cars by multiplying the total number of cars by 1/2:

516 cars * 1/2 = 258 cars

Now, the total number of blue and red cars are 172 + 258 = 430. We know that the total number of cars is 516, and the number of blue and red cars is 430, so the number of black cars must be the difference between the total number of cars and the number of blue and red cars:

516 - 430 = 86

Answer: 86
