Let's first find Antoinette's weight. Let's say Antoinette's weight is x kilograms. Then, since Rupert's weight is 2 times Antoinette's, we can write an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2x = 98

We can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to get:

x + x = 98 - 7

We can subtract 7 from both sides again to get:

x = 91

So, Antoinette weighs 91 kilograms.
