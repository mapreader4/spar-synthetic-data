Let's break it down step by step.

Rita started with $400.

She bought 5 dresses, each costing $20, so she spent 5 x 20 = $100 on dresses.

She bought 3 pairs of pants, each costing $12, so she spent 3 x 12 = $36 on pants.

She bought 4 jackets, each costing $30, so she spent 4 x 30 = $120 on jackets.

She also spent $5 on transportation, so she spent an additional $5.

So, she spent $100 + $36 + $120 + $5 = $241.

She started with $400, so she has $400 - $241 = $159 left.

Answer: 159
