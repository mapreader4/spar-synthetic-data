Let's break this down step by step.

Mell ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake, so her total cost is:

2 cups of coffee = 2 x $4 = $8
1 piece of cake = $7
Total cost for Mell = $8 + $7 = $15

Two of her friends also ordered the same: 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake, so their total cost is also:

2 cups of coffee = 2 x $4 = $8
1 piece of cake = $7
Total cost for each friend = $8 + $7 = $15

Each of these friends also bought a bowl of ice cream, so their total cost is:

$15 (for coffee and cake) + $3 (for ice cream) = $18

Since there are two friends, the total cost for their orders is:

2 x $18 = $36

Adding Mell's cost to the total cost for her friends, the total cost for all three is:

$15 (Mell) + $36 (friends) = $51
