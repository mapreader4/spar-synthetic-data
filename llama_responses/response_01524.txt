Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with Max. Max attended 40 college courses in 2 years, so he attended 20 courses per year. Since Sid attended four times as many college courses as Max, so he attended 80 college courses in the same period.

So, the total number of college courses attended by both Max and Sid is 40 + 80 = 120.
