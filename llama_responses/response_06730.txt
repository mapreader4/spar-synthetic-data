Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of carrots that were used. The cook used 2/5 of the carrots initially. This means that 2/5 of the 300 carrots were used. So, we can set up an equation to represent the remaining number of carrots:

300 - (2/5) =?

To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 5:

300 * 5 = 1500

So, the cook used 1500 carrots.

To find the number of carrots not used, we need to subtract the total used from the total:

300 - 1500 = 100

Answer: 100
