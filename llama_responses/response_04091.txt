Let's break it down step by step:

1. The office has an even number of men and women. Let's assume the total number of people in the office is even. Let's call this number x.

2. Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor. This means that 4 men and 6 women are removed from the office floor.

3. The number of women working on the office floor is reduced by 20%. Let's find 20% of the total number of people. We can find this by multiplying the total number of people by 0.2.

4. The total number of people is x. So, we can multiply x by 0.2 to find the number of women removed.

5. The number of women removed is 20% of the total number of people. So, we can subtract 20% of x from x to get the new number of women working on the office floor.

6. Since the number of women removed is 6, we can set up the equation: 20% of x = 6.

7. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.2. We get:

0.2x = 6

8. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5. We get:

x = 6 / 0.2

9. The result of the division is 30.

Answer: 30
