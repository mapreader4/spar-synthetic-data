Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by calculating the total amount of money the farmer earned from selling the potatoes. Each bundle of potatoes was sold for $1.90, and there were 25 bundles. So the total amount of money earned from selling the potatoes is:

25 * 1.90 = 47.50

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the farmer earned from selling the carrots. Each bundle of carrots was sold for $2, and there were 20 bundles. So the total amount of money earned from selling the carrots is:

20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the amount earned from selling the potatoes and the amount earned from selling the carrots:

47.50 + 40 = 87.50

So, the total amount of money the farmer got from selling all his harvested crops is 87.50.
