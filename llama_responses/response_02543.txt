Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the amount of water Matthew drinks in a day. He drinks 4 glasses of water per day, and each glass is 5 ounces. So, the total amount of water he drinks in a day is 4 * 5 = 20 ounces.

Now, we need to find out how many times he can fill the 35-ounce water bottle. To do this, we can divide 35 ounces by the amount he drinks in a day, which is 20 ounces. 35 รท 20 = 1.75.

So, Matthew will fill the 35-ounce water bottle 1.75 times each week.
