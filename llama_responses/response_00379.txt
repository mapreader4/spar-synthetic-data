Let's break this down step by step:

1. John buys a piano for $500.

2. He hires a teacher for 20 lessons at $40 per lesson.

3. He gets a 25% discount on the teacher's services.

4. To find the total cost of the teacher's services, we need to calculate the cost of 20 lessons at $40 per lesson and then multiply it by 0.75 (because of the 25% discount).

$40 x 20 = $800

$800 x 0.75 = $600

5. To find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the piano and the cost of the teacher's services.

$500 + $600 = $1100

Answer: 1100
