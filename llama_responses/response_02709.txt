Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start with the information given: Class A is twice as big as Class B. This means that the size of Class A is 2 * Class B.

We are also given that Class A is also a third the size of Class C. So, Class A is (1/3) * Class C.

Now, we know that Class B has 20 people in it. If Class A is 2 * Class B, then Class A has 2 * 20 = 40 people in it.

We are asked to find the size of Class C. We know that Class A is (1/3) * Class C. So, we can set up an equation to solve for Class C:

2 * Class B = Class A = 40
(1/3) * Class C = Class A

We can solve for Class C by multiplying both sides by 3:

Class C = (2 * 40) / 3
Class C = 80 / 3
Class C = 26.67

So, there are 26 people in Class C.
