Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let the number of employees hired in the second week be x.

Since the number of employees hired on the first week was 200 more than the second week, the number of employees hired on the first week is x + 200.

The number of employees hired on the third week is 150 more than the second week, so the number of employees hired on the third week is x + 150.

The number of employees hired on the fourth week is twice the number hired in the third week, which is 2(x + 150) = 2x + 300.

We know that the number of employees hired on the fourth week is 400, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 300 = 400

Subtracting 300 from both sides gives:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 50

So, the number of employees hired on the second week is 50.

The number of employees hired on the first week is 50 + 200 = 250.

The number of employees hired on the third week is 50 + 150 = 200.

To find the average number of employees hired per week, we add up the number of employees hired in each week and divide by 4:

(250 + 50 + 200 + 400) / 4 = 900 / 4 = 225

Answer: 225
