Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by counting the number of stripes on each type of hat.

* 4 hats with 3 stripes each = 4 * 3 = 12 stripes
* 3 hats with 4 stripes each = 3 * 4 = 12 stripes
* 6 hats with no stripes = 6 * 0 = 0 stripes
* 2 hats with 5 stripes each = 2 * 5 = 10 stripes

Now, let's add up the number of stripes on each type of hat:

12 + 12 + 0 + 10 = 24

Answer: 24
