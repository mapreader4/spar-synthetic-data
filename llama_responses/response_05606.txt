Let's break this down step by step.

Gunther has 3 hours of free time available, which is equal to 180 minutes.

He needs to vacuum the carpets for 45 minutes, so that's 45 minutes taken away from his free time.

He needs to dust the furniture for 60 minutes, so that's another 60 minutes taken away from his free time.

He needs to mop the floors in his kitchen for 30 minutes, so that's 30 minutes taken away from his free time.

He has 3 cats, and it takes him 5 minutes to brush each cat, so he needs to brush his cats for a total of 15 minutes (3 x 5 = 15).

So, the total time Gunther spends cleaning is 45 + 60 + 30 + 15 = 150 minutes.

To find out how much free time he has left, we subtract the total time spent cleaning from the total free time:

180 (total free time) - 150 (time spent cleaning) = 30

So, Gunther will have 30 minutes of free time left after he cleans his apartment.

Answer: 30
