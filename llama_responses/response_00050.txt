Let's break this problem down step by step.

Gerald wants to save up money for his baseball supplies, which cost $100 in total. He has 4 months to save up.

Let's find out how much he needs to save each month.

We know that he charges $10 for each chore. So, we can set up an equation:

Let's say x be the number of chores he needs to do each month. Then, we can set up an equation:

10x = 100 / 4

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10:

x = 100 / 4

x = 25

So, Gerald needs to do 25 chores each month to save up for his baseball supplies.
