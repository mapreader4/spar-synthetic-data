Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, there are 300 athletes at the camp.

For 4 hours, 28 athletes leave the camp per hour, so the total number of athletes leaving is:

28 athletes/hour * 4 hours = 112 athletes

So, there are 300 - 112 = 188 athletes left in the camp.

Then, for 7 hours, 15 athletes arrive per hour, so the total number of athletes arriving is:

15 athletes/hour * 7 hours = 105 athletes

So, the total number of athletes in the camp after the new group arrives is:

188 (remaining athletes) + 105 (new athletes) = 293 athletes

The camp gate is shut, and everyone goes to bed. The difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is:

300 (initial athletes) - 293 (final athletes) = 7 athletes

Answer: 7
