Let's break this problem down step by step.

Jerry was in the pool for 3 minutes.

Elaine stayed in the pool for twice as long as Jerry, so Elaine was in the pool for 2 x 3 = 6 minutes.

George could only stay in the pool for one-third as long as Elaine, so George was in the pool for 1/3 x 6 = 2 minutes.

Kramer, who accidentally locked himself in the bathroom, could not find the pool, so he was not in the pool at all.

To find the combined total of minutes that Jerry and his friends were in the cold water, we add up the minutes each of them was in the pool:

3 (Jerry) + 6 (Elaine) + 2 (George) = 11

Answer: 11
