Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the electrician. Since the electrician makes double what a worker is paid, and the plumber makes 250% of a worker's salary, we can write an equation for the electrician's salary as 2x, where x is the worker's salary.

The plumber's salary is 250% of the worker's salary, so we can write an equation for the plumber's salary as 0.25x.

The total labor cost for the day is the sum of the electrician's salary and the plumber's salary, which is 2x + 0.25x.

The worker's salary is not specified, so we can let's call it w. The electrician's salary is 2w and the plumber's salary is 0.25w.

The total labor cost is 2w + 0.25w.

To find the total labor cost, we need to substitute the worker's salary in for w. This gives us 2w + 0.25w = 2.25w.

Answer: 2.25w
