Let's break it down step by step:

Georgia bought one dozen carnations (12) for each of her 5 teachers. That's a total of 12 * 5 = 60 carnations. She also bought one carnation for each of her 14 friends, so that's another 14 carnations. In total, she bought 60 + 14 = 74 carnations. Each carnation costs $0.50, so the total cost would be 74 * 0.50 = 37.00.

Answer: 37.00
