Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information.

* Ryan got 5 books from the library.
* The total number of pages is 2100.
* Ryan's brother read 1 book a day that was 200 pages each.
* They finished the books in a week, which means 7 days.

Now, let's find the number of pages Ryan read per day. We can find this by subtracting the total number of pages by the number of books his brother read.

The total number of pages Ryan read is 2100.
The number of pages his brother read is 200 * 7 = 1400.
To find the number of pages Ryan read per day, we subtract the number of pages his brother read from the total number of pages:

2100 - 1400 = 700

Answer: 700
