Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with Rubert. Rubert has 4 times the number of candies James has. James has 3 times the number of candies Adam has. So, let's write an equation to represent this information:

Let's call the number of candies Rubert has 4 times the number of candies James has "R" and the number of candies James has "J". So, the equation is:

R = 4J

Now, let's think about the number of candies Adam has. We know that Adam has 6 candies, so let's write an equation for Adam's number of candies in terms of "A":

A = 6

Now we can write the equation for the total number of candies the three of them have:

R + J + A = 4(3) + 6

We can multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then we add 6 to get the total number of candies:

12 + 6 = 18

Answer: 18
