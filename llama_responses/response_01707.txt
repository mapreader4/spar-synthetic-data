Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Anais has more toys than Kamari.
* The total number of toys is 160.

Let's use the given information to set up an equation. Let's say Kamari has x toys. Then, we can write the equation:

x + (number of toys Anais has) = 160

We know that Anais has 30 more toys than Kamari, so we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to get:

x + (number of toys Anais has - 30) = 160

The number of toys Anais has is 30 more than Kamari, so the number of toys Anais has is 30 + x. So, we can replace x with 30 + x:

30 + x = 160

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 130

So, the number of toys in Kamari's box is 130.
