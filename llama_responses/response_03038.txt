Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by using the information given in the problem: the spacecraft traveled from Planet X to Planet Y in 8 hours less than twice the number of hours in a typical earth day. Let's call the number of hours in a typical earth day t. Then, we can write an equation to represent the distance traveled by the spacecraft:

Distance = Speed * Time

We know that the distance between the two planets is 4,000 parsecs. We can plug this value into the equation:

4,000 parsecs = Speed * t

Now, we know that a typical earth day has 24 hours, which is equal to 24 hours. So, the number of hours in a typical earth day is 24. Since the spacecraft traveled in 8 hours less than 2 * 24 hours, we can write:

t = 2 * 24 - 8

t = 40

Now, we can plug this value back into the equation:

4,000 = Speed * 40

Speed = 4,000 / 40

Speed = 100

So, the average speed of the Starship Conundrum during this voyage was 100 parsecs per hour.
