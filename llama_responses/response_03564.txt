Let's break this problem down step by step.

The total cost of the items Tina bought is $50 for the bread, $150 for the ham, and $200 for the cake. We can find the total cost by adding these amounts together:

$50 + $150 + $200 = $300

The cost of the ham and bread is $50 + $150 = $200. So, the percent of the cost that is the ham and bread is:

($200 / $300) * 100 = 66.67%

Answer: 66.67
