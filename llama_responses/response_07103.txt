Let's think step by step:

Harry wants to buy 14 balloons, and a pack of 10 balloons is cheaper and costs $3. So, to buy 14 balloons, he needs to buy 1.4 packs of balloons. Each pack costs $3, so 1.4 packs would be 1.4 x $3 = $4.2. However, since he can only buy whole packs, he will need to buy 2 packs of balloons, which would cost 2 x $3 = $6. This is more than the 4.2 he would have needed for 1.4 packs. Therefore, he will have $2 left over, which is the change. Answer: 6
