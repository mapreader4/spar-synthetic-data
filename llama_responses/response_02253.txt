Let's break this problem down step by step.

Ines had $20 in her purse initially.

She bought 3 pounds of peaches, which are $2 per pound. So, the total cost of the peaches is 3 x 2 = 6 dollars.

So, the cost of the peaches is subtracted from her initial amount of money, which is $20. So, she has:

$20 - 6 = $14

Answer: 14
