Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Lola's 10 breeding rabbits had 10 times as many kittens as the number of breeding rabbits Lola has. So, Lola has 10 breeding rabbits.

Step 2: Half of the kittens got adopted, so 10 / 2 = 5 kittens got adopted. So, Lola had 10 - 5 = 5 kittens remaining.

Step 3: In the next spring, Lola's 10 breeding rabbits had a total of 60 kittens, with 4 of the kittens being adopted. So, 60 - 4 = 56 kittens.

Step 4: Including the breeding rabbits, Lola has 10 breeding rabbits + 56 kittens = 66.

Answer: 66
