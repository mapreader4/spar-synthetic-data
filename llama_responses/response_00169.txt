Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the current rate of production.

Borris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. So, the current rate of production is 90 / 6 = 15 kilograms per month.

Step 2: Determine the new rate of production.

Borris wants to increase the production by 20%. This means that the new rate of production will be 1.2 * 15 = 18 kilograms per month.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of grapes needed in a year.

Borris needs to know how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year. So, we can multiply the new rate of production by the number of months in a year to find the total amount of grapes needed.

18 * 12 = 216 kilograms.

Answer: 216
