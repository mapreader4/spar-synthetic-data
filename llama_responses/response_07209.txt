Let's break it down step by step.

The price of 1 caramel is $3, so the price of 4 candy bars is 4 x 3 = $12. The price of 6 candy bars is 6 x? Since the price of 1 caramel is $3, the price of 6 candy bars is 6 x 3 = $18. The price of 3 caramel is 3 x? Since the price of 1 caramel is $3, the price of 3 caramel is 3 x 3 = $9. The price of 1 cotton candy is half the price of 4 candy bars, which is 1/2 x 12 = $6. To find the total cost of 6 candy bars, 3 caramel, and 1 cotton candy, we add up the prices: 18 + 9 + 6 = 33. The answer is: Answer: 33
