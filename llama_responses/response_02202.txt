Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* There are 5 classes.
* Each class uses 2 whiteboards.
* Each whiteboard needs about 20ml of ink for a day's use.
* Ink costs 50 cents per ml.

Let's calculate the total amount of ink needed for a day:

5 classes * 2 whiteboards * 20ml = 100ml of ink needed for a day

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the ink needed for a day:

100ml * 50 cents/ml = 5000 cents

So, the cost of the ink needed for a day would be:

Answer: 50.
