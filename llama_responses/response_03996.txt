Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices.
* Buzz decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8.
* Buzz's ratio is 5, so it means that for every 5 slices, Buzz will eat 8 slices.

To find the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate, we need to multiply the total number of slices (78) by the ratio of 5:8. 

Let's do that:

78 * 5 = 390

Now, we need to find the number of slices that the waiter ate. To do this, we need to divide the total number of slices by 5:

390 รท 5 = 78

So, the waiter ate 78 - 78 = 0 slices of pizza.
