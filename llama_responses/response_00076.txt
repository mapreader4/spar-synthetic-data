Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the cucumbers. We know that there are 60 cucumbers. Now, we know that there are twice as many peppers as cucumbers, so there are 2 x 60 = 120 peppers.

Now, let's add the potatoes to this. We know there are 237 potatoes. We need to add the peppers to this. To do this, we can add the 120 peppers to the 237 potatoes.

237 + 120 = 357.

Answer: 357
