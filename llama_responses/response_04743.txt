To find the total number of tires changed, we need to multiply the number of vehicles of each type by the number of tires per vehicle.

There are 12 motorcycles and each motorcycle has 2 tires. 12 * 2 = 24.

There are 10 cars and each car has 4 tires. 10 * 4 = 40.

To find the total number of tires changed, we add the number of tires changed on the motorcycles and the number of tires changed on the cars.

24 + 40 = 64

Answer: 64
