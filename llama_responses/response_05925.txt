Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cases in California and Texas.

In California, there were half the number of cases as New York, so if New York had 2000 cases, California had 2000 / 2 = 1000 cases.

In Texas, there were 400 more cases than California, so if California had 1000 cases, Texas had 1000 + 400 = 1400 cases.

Now, we need to add the number of cases in New York, California, and Texas.

2000 (New York) + 1000 (California) + 1400 (Texas) = 3400

Answer: 3400
