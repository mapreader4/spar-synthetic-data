Let's start by using the information given to find the number of books that the librarian bought last year. Two years ago, the librarian bought 300 books, and the year before that, she bought 300 books. So, the total number of books bought in the last two years is 300 + 300 = 600.

The librarian donated 200 books this year. So, the number of books the librarian has is 500 - 600 + 200 = 700. There were 500 books in the library 5 years ago. So, the number of books in the library now is 700 - 500 = 200.
