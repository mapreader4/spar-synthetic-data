Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of friends with Ron is x.

The pizza was cut into 12 slices, and each of the friends ate 4 slices. So, the total number of slices eaten is 4 * x.

We know that the total number of slices eaten is equal to the total number of slices in the pizza, which is 12. So, we can set up an equation:

4 * x = 12

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 12 / 4
x = 3

So, there were 3 friends with Ron.
