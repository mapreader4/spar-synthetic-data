Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. For the first 5 days, Tom charges a fee of $100, so the cost for the first 5 days is $100.

2. For the remaining days, Tom charges a fee of $60 per day, so the cost for the remaining days is $60 x 5 = $300.

3. To find the total cost, we add the cost for the first 5 days and the cost for the remaining days: $100 + $300 = $400.

Answer: 400
