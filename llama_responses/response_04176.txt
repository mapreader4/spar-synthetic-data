Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Daisy and Rose have x dogs. Each dog has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs/paws is 4x.

We know that there are 24 legs/paws in the pool. So, we can set up an equation:

4x = 24

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 24 / 4

x = 6

Answer: 6
