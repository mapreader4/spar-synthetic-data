Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Linda wants to do two coats. Since a gallon of paint can cover 400 sq. ft., we know that she will need 2 times that amount of paint to do two coats.

2 x 400 = 800

So, Linda will need 800 sq. ft. of paint to do two coats.

Since the wall area is 600 sq. ft., we can divide the wall area by the amount of paint needed to find out how many gallons of paint Linda needs.

600 sq. ft. รท 800 sq. ft. = 0.75

So, Linda will need 0.75 gallons of paint to do two coats.

Answer: 0.75
