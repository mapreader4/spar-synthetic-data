Let's break this down step by step.

Ivan had $10 initially.

He spent 1/5 of it on cupcakes, which is the same as 2 dollars. So, he has 10 - 2 = $8 left.

Then, he spent some money on a milkshake, and he had only $3 left.

Let's call the amount of money he spent on the milkshake x.

So, 8 - x = 3.

To find the value of x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation.

x = 8 - 3 = 5.
