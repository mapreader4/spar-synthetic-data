Let's break it down step by step:

Stormi washes 3 cars for $10 each, so she spends 3 x $10 = $30.

She mows 2 lawns for $13 each, so she spends 2 x $13 = $26.

In total, she spends $30 + $26 = $56.

The bicycle costs $80, so she needs $80 - $56 = $24 more to afford the bicycle.

Answer: 24
