Let's break this down step by step.

1. There are 42 apples in a crate.
2. 12 crates of apples were delivered to a factory.
3. 4 apples were rotten and had to be thrown away.
4. The remaining apples were packed into boxes that could fit 10 apples each.

So, the total number of apples is 42 - 4 = 38.
5. Since each box can fit 10 apples, the number of boxes needed is 38 / 10 = 3.83.

So, the answer is: Answer: 3
