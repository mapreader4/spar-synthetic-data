Let's break it down step by step:

On Monday, they sold 12 bouquets.
On Tuesday, they sold three times that many bouquets, so they sold 12 * 3 = 36 bouquets.
On Wednesday, they sold a third of the amount they sold the day before, which is 12 + 36 = 48. So they sold 12 + 36 + 12 = 60 bouquets.

Answer: 60
