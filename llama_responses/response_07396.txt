Let's break down the problem step by step.

The restaurant charges $8.00 for one serving. There are 16 servings in a bottle of spirits. So, the total cost for 1 bottle would be:

8.00 * 16 = 128.00

Since the bottle costs $30.00, the restaurant would make a profit of:

30.00 - 128.00 = 22.00

So, the answer is: Answer: 22.00
