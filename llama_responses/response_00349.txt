Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "A farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, and 4 more goats".

Let's let "x" be the number of cows the farmer has. Then, we know that the farmer has 4 more goats than cows. So, the number of goats is x + 4.

The total number of animals the farmer has is the sum of the number of pigs and the number of goats. We know that the number of pigs is 2x, so the total number of animals is 2x + (x + 4).

The total number of animals is 56, so we can set up the equation 2x + (x + 4) = 56.

Now, we need to solve for x. Let's subtract 4 from both sides of the equation. 2x + (x + 4) - 4 = 56 - 4. This simplifies to 2x + x = 52.

Now, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get x = 26.

So, the farmer has 26 goats.
