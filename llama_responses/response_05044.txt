Let's first identify the number of half-day students. We are given that 25% of the total number of students are half-day students. To find the number of half-day students, we multiply 25% of the total number of students with the total number of students. The total number of students is 80. 25% of 80 is 25/100 of 80, or 20. The number of full-day students is then 80 - 20 = 60.
