Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total width of the splashes made by the pebbles. Since each pebble makes a splash that is 1/4 meter wide, and TreQuan tosses 6 pebbles, the total width of the splashes made by the pebbles is:

6 x 1/4 = 1.5 meters

Next, we need to find the total width of the splashes made by the rocks. Since each rock makes a splash that is 1/2 meter wide, and TreQuan tosses 3 rocks, the total width of the splashes made by the rocks is:

3 x 1/2 = 1.5 meters

Now, let's find the total width of the splashes made by the boulders. Since each boulder makes a splash that is 2 meters wide, and TreQuan tosses 2 boulders, the total width of the splashes made by the boulders is:

2 x 2 = 4 meters

Finally, we need to add up the total widths of the splashes made by the pebbles, rocks, and boulders to find the total width of all the splashes. This is:

1.5 + 1.5 + 4 = 7 meters
