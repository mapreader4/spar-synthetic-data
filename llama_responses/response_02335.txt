Let's start by first finding the total number of slices of bread. Since each loaf of bread was sliced into 15 slices, and there are 4 loaves, the total number of slices of bread is:

15 * 4 = 60

Since there are 10 friends, to find out how many slices each of them ate, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of friends:

60 รท 10 = 6

So, each of the 10 friends ate 6 slices of bread.
