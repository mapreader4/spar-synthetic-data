Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Javier has already played 20 games, and he has averaged 2 hits in each game. So, the total number of hits he has is 2 * 20 = 40.

Step 2: Javier has 10 games left to play. To find the total number of hits he needs to get to an average of 3 hits per game, we need to find the total number of hits he needs in total.

Let's call the total number of hits he needs x. We can set up an equation: 40 (current total hits) + x (hits in remaining games) = 3 (hits per game) * (total games).

Step 3: We know that Javier has 10 games left to play. So, the total number of hits he needs is 3 * 30 = 30.

Answer: 30
