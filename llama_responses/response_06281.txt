Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* Jenna catches an eel that's 1/3 as long as Bill's.
* The combined length of their eels is 64 inches.

We can represent the information in an equation:

Let x be the length of Jenna's eel. Then, the combined length of their eels is 64 inches, so we can set up the equation:

x + (1/3)x = 64

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:

(1/3)x * 3 = 64

This simplifies to:

x = 64 / 3

x = 21.33

So, the length of Jenna's eel is 21.33 inches.
