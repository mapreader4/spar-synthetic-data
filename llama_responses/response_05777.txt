Let's break this down step by step.

Peter is buying 16 pounds of bone-in chicken. He's also buying half that amount in hamburgers, which is 16 / 2 = 8 pounds. Then, he's buying 2 more pounds of hot dogs than hamburgers, so that's 8 + 2 = 10 pounds of hot dogs. The sides will weigh half the amount of hot dogs, so that's 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of sides.

So, in total, Peter will buy 16 pounds of chicken, 8 pounds of hamburgers, 10 pounds of hot dogs, and 5 pounds of sides. That's a total of 16 + 8 + 10 + 5 = 39 pounds of food.
