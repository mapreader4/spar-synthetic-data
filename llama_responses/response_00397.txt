The total cost of the gift is the original total cost divided by the number of people who are paying for it. If 4 people dropped out, that means that 6 people are paying for the gift. The cost is split equally among 6 people, so each person's share is 1/6 of the total cost. The total cost is the original cost divided by the number of people paying, so if the cost is $x, then 1/6 of the cost is x/6. We can solve for x by multiplying the cost by 6 to get the cost for 1/6 of it. 1/6 of the cost is 8, so x = 8 * 6 = 48. The cost is 48.
