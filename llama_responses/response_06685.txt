Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of pizzas Craig made on their first day. The problem states that Heather made four times as many pizzas as Craig made, so if Craig made x pizzas, Heather made 4x pizzas. The problem also states that Craig made 40 pizzas on their first day, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

4x = 40

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 40 / 4
x = 10

So Craig made 10 pizzas on their first day.

Now, we know that Heather made 20 fewer pizzas than Craig's number on their second day. Since Craig made 10 pizzas on their first day, Heather made 10 - 20 = 10 pizzas on their second day.

The problem also states that Craig made 60 more pizzas on their second day than their first day, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

10 + 60 = 70

So Craig made 70 pizzas on their second day.

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas the two made together in the two days. We can add the number of pizzas they made on each day together:

10 + 70 = 80

Answer: 80
