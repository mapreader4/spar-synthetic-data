Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total amount of money the company wants to make in an entire year. The total amount is $60,000. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can divide the total amount by 12 to find the amount they need to make per month:

$60,000 รท 12 = $5,000

So, the company needs to make $5,000 per month to reach the desired total of $60,000 in a year.

Answer: 5000
