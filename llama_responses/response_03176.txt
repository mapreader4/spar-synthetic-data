Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by using the information that Matthew is two years older than Rebecca. This means that Rebecca is 3 years old.

We know that Matthew is four years younger than Freddy. So, we can set up an equation to find Freddy's age.

Let's call Freddy's age 'x'. Then, we know that Matthew is x + 2 years old, and Rebecca is x - 4 years old.

We can set up an equation: x + 2 = x - 4 + 35.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 35 - 4. Solving for x, we get x = 19.

So, Freddy is 19 years old.
