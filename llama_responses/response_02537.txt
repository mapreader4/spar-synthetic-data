Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the jar of hot sauce is x ounces.  The number of servings is x / 0.5 = 2 ounces.  We know that James uses 3 servings a day.

Let's set up an equation to represent the number of days the jar of hot sauce will last.  The equation is x - (3 * 0.5) = 2.

The question is asking how many days will the jar of hot sauce last.  So, we need to solve for x.

To do this, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation.  We get x - 3 * 0.5 = 2 + 2.

To solve for x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation to both sides of the equation.  We get x - 3 * 0.5 + 2 = 2 + 2.

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation.  We get x - 3 * 0.5 = 4.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 1.  We get 1 * x = 4.

So, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.  We get x = 4 / 1.

x = 4 / 1 = 4.

Answer: 4
