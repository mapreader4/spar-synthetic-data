Let's break it down step by step.

Bob drove for 1 and a half hours at 60 mph. 1 and a half hours is the same as 1.5 hours. 1.5 hours at 60 mph is equal to 90 miles. 

Then Bob drove for 2 hours at 45 mph. 2 hours at 45 mph is equal to 90 miles. 

So, in total, Bob drove for 90 + 90 miles. 90 + 90 is equal to 180 miles.

Answer: 180
