To find the total number of egg whites needed, we need to find the total number of egg whites needed for both cakes and then divide it by 2.

The recipe requires 8 egg whites for each cake, and since there are 2 cakes, the total number of egg whites needed is 8 x 2 = 16.

Since every 2 tablespoons of aquafaba is equivalent to 1 egg white, we need to divide the total number of egg whites by 2 to find the total number of tablespoons of aquafaba needed.

16 egg whites / 2 = 8 tablespoons of aquafaba.

Answer: 8
