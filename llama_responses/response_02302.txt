Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the price in 2001 was x. Since the price decreases by $35 each year, we know that the price in 2009 is 35 less than the price in 2001.

We know that the price in 2001 is $1950. So, the price in 2009 is 35 less than $1950.

Let's subtract 35 from 1950 to find the price in 2009.

1950 - 35 = 1915

So, the price in 2009 was $1915.

Answer: 1915
