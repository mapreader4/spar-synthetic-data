Let's break it down step by step.

1. There are 13 stripes in total.
2. The first stripe is red, and half of the remaining stripes are also red.
3. So, half of 13 is 6.5, but since we can't have half of a stripe, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.
4. The first stripe is red, and 7 of the remaining stripes are also red.
5. So, there are 7 red stripes.

Answer: 7
