Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of poets is x.

Since there are 50 more poets than treehuggers, we know that the number of poets is 50 more than the number of treehuggers.

The number of poets is 50 more than the number of treehuggers, so we can set up the equation:

x + 50 = 50

Subtract 50 from both sides to get:

x = 50 - 50
x = 0

So, there are 0 poets at the party.
