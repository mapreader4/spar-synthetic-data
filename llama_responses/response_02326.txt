Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that Amanda's garden contains 20 flowers and Peter's garden contains 3 times as many flowers as Amanda's, so Peter's garden contains 3 x 20 = 60 flowers.

Then, Peter gave 15 flowers to his brother, which means that there are 60 - 15 = 45 flowers left in his garden.

Answer: 45
