Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cars that cost less than $15000. Since 15% of the cars cost less than $15000, we can set up an equation:

15% of 3000 cars cost less than $15000.

Let's find 15% of 3000:

15% of 3000 = 0.15 x 3000 = 450

So, 450 cars cost less than $15000.

Now, let's identify the number of cars that cost more than $20000. Since 40% of the cars cost more than $20000, we can set up an equation:

40% of 3000 cars cost more than $20000.

Let's find 40% of 3000:

40% of 3000 = 0.4 x 3000 = 1200

So, 1200 cars cost more than $20000.

Now, let's find the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000. To find this out, we can add the number of cars that cost less than $15000 and the number of cars that cost more than $20000:

450 + 1200 = 1650

Answer: 1650
