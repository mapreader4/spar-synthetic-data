Let's break it down step by step.

Jerry pierces someone's nose for 20 dollars. So, he makes 20 dollars per nose. He pierces 6 noses, so he makes 6 x 20 = 120 dollars for the noses.

Jerry pierces someone's ears for 50% more than the nose, so he pierces the ears for 20 + 50 = 70 dollars each. He pierces 9 ears, so he makes 9 x 70 = 630 dollars for the ears.

In total, Jerry makes 120 + 630 = 750 dollars.
