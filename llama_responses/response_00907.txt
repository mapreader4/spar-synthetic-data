Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that the store received 20 pallets of paper products. We are told that half of the pallets were paper towels, so we can find half of 20, which is 10, were paper towels. A quarter of the pallets were paper tissues, which is a quarter of 20, which is 5. A fifth of the pallets were paper plates, which is a fifth of 20, which is 4. 

The remaining pallets were paper cups. To find the number of paper cups, we can subtract the number of paper towels, paper tissues, and paper plates from the total number of pallets. We have 20 - 10 - 5 - 4 = 5. Therefore, the store received 5 pallets of paper cups.
