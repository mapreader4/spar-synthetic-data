Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* There are 10 cases of bottled water.
* Each case contains 20 bottles.
* 70 bottles of water were used during the first game.
* After the first game, there are 20 bottles left.

Let's use a variable, say 'b', to represent the number of bottles used during the second game.

We know that the total number of bottles used during both games is 70, and we know that 70 - 20 = 50 bottles were used during the second game.

So, the answer is: Answer: 50
