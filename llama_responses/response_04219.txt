Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the given information: James listens to 200 beats per minute and 2 hours of music a day.

To find the total number of beats James hears in a day, we can multiply the number of beats per minute by the number of minutes in a day:

200 beats per minute x 60 minutes per hour = 12000 beats per hour

Since James listens to 2 hours of music a day, we can multiply the number of beats per hour by the number of hours in a day:

12000 beats per hour x 2 hours = 24000 beats

Answer: 24000
