Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Jeremy's age is x.

Amy is 1/3 the age of Jeremy, so Amy's age is x/3.

Chris is twice as old as Amy, so Chris's age is 2 * (x/3) = 2x/3.

The total age of the three of them is 132.

So, we can set up an equation:

x + x/3 + 2x/3 = 132

We can combine the fractions by finding the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 3. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

x + x + 2x = 132*3

Subtract x from both sides of the equation:

x + x = 132*3 - 2x

Combine like terms:

x = 132*3 - x

Distribute the 3:

x = 396 - x

Now, subtract x from both sides of the equation to get:

x - x = 396

Add x to both sides to get:

2x = 396

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 198

Answer: 198
