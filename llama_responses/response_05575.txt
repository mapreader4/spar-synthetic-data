Let's say the aunt gave each of them x dollars. Since Jade had 38 dollars, and Julia had half of that amount, we know that Julia had 19 dollars. If their aunt gave them an equal amount of money, then Jade and Julia received the same amount. So, if we add the amounts together, we get 38 + 19 = 57. But, they received a total of 97 dollars, so the aunt must have given them 40 dollars each. So, the answer is:

Answer: 40
