To solve this problem, I will first find the total number of stickers that Paige has, which is 100 + 50 = 150. Then, I will divide this total by 4 to find out how many stickers each of her 4 friends will get. 150 divided by 4 is 37.5. Since Paige is not giving stickers to her friends, but instead to 3 friends, I will divide 150 by 3 to find out how many stickers she will have left. 150 divided by 3 is 50. Therefore, Paige will have 50 stickers left.
