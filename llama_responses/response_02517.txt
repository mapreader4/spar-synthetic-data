Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The house was purchased for $80000.
2. The house was sold for a 20% profit, which means the selling price is 120% of the original price, or 1.2 * 80000 = 96000.
3. The broker's commission is 5% of the original price, which is 0.05 * 80000 = 4000.
4. The total selling price is the sum of the selling price and the broker's commission: 96000 + 4000 = 100400.

Answer: 100400
