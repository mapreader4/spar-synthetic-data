Let's break it down step by step.

The first lock stalls the raccoons for 5 minutes. The next lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock, which means it stalls them for 5 - 3 * 3 = 9 minutes.

When Karen tries both locks at once, it stalls the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone. The second lock stalls them for 9 minutes, so it stalls them for 9 * 5 = 45 minutes.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 45
