Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "Brandon has been fired from half the businesses in town and has quit from a third of them."

First, we can find half of the 72 businesses: 72 / 2 = 36.

Then, we can find a third of that: 36 / 3 = 12.

So, Brandon can still apply to 36 - 12 = 24 businesses.
