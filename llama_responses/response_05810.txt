Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of students at the school. We are given that 64 is 100% of the students, and 32% of the students are seventh graders. So, to find the number of seventh graders, we can multiply 32% of the students by multiplying 64 by 0.32.

32% of 64 = 64 * 0.32 = 20

So, the number of seventh graders is 20.
