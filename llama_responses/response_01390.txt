To find the total cost of the coffee, we can multiply the number of coffees of each type by the cost of each type, then add them up.  There are 20 days in 1 week.  In the morning, Nancy buys 2 coffees, for a total cost of 2 x 3.00 = $6.00.  In the afternoon, she buys 1 coffee, for a total of 1 x 2.50 = $2.50.  The total cost of her coffee for the week is 6 + 2.50 = $8.50.
