Let's start by finding the number of cookies that Javier's wife took, which is 0.3 x 200 = 60.

Then, Javier's daughter took 40 cookies, leaving 200 - 60 - 40 = 100 cookies. Then, Javier ate half of the remaining cookies, which is 100 รท 2 = 50.

So, the number of cookies that Javier did not eat is 100 - 50 = 50.
