Let's break this problem down step by step.

Braden had $400 in his money box initially.

If the Raptors beat the Bulls and Braden wins the bet, he and Bryan will give him twice as much money as Braden had in his money box. Twice as much money as Braden had is 2 x 400 = 800.

So, if Braden wins the bet, he will receive 800 dollars from Bryan. Adding this to the 400 he had initially, we get:

400 + 800 = 1200

So, the total amount of money Braden had in his money box after winning the bet is:

Answer: 1200
