Let's solve this problem step by step.

Mary had 89 stickers initially.

She used 3 stickers on the front page of her journal.

So, the number of stickers left is 89 - 3 = 86.

Then, she used 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal.

So, the number of stickers left is 86 - (7 * 6) = 86 - 42 = 44.

Answer: 44
