Let's break this down step by step:

Let's first find the price of the $300 lens. Since it has a 20% discount, the price is 80% of $300. We can write this as an equation:

$300 * 0.8 = $240

This is the price of the $300 lens after the 20% discount. So, the original price is $300.

Now, let's find the price of the $220 lens. The price of the $220 lens is the price without the 20% discount. We can write this as an equation:

$220 is the price without the 20% discount. To find the price with the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $220. We can write this as an equation:

$220 * 0.2 = $44

This is the price without the 20% discount. So, we need to add this to the original price of $220 to find the price with the 20% discount:

$220 + $44 = $264

The price with the 20% discount is $264. The original price is $300, so the discount is:

$300 - $264 = $36

Mark saves $36 by buying the cheaper lens.
