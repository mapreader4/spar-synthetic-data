Let's start by identifying the number of woodwind players. There are 4 times as many percussion players as woodwind players, and there are 4 woodwind players. Therefore, there are 4 woodwind players. There are twice as many brass players as woodwind players, which is 2 x 4 = 8. So, the total number of brass players is 8.
