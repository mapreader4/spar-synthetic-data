Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of hours Natasha exercised. Natasha exercised for 30 minutes every day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, Natasha exercised 7 x 30 minutes, which is 210 minutes. To convert this to hours, we can divide 210 minutes by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and we get 3.5 hours.

Now, let's find the number of hours Esteban exercised. Esteban exercised for 10 minutes on each of 9 days. So, Esteban exercised 9 x 10 minutes, which is 90 minutes. To convert this to hours, we can divide 90 minutes by 60, and we get 1.5 hours.

To find the total number of hours Natasha and Esteban exercised, we can add 3.5 hours and 1.5 hours. 3.5 + 1.5 is 5 hours.

Answer: 5
