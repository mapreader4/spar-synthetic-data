Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the number of dancers. We know that a fourth of the 140 kids are dancers, so we can set up an equation: 1/4 * 140 = 35.

Now, of the 35 dancers, 25 danced the slow dance. So, we can set up another equation: 25 =?.

To solve this, we can subtract 25 from 35 to find the number of dancers who did not slow dance: 35 - 25 = 10.

So, the answer is: Answer: 10.
