Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sheena can sew one dress in 12 hours. There are 5 dresses to be sewn, so it will take her 5 x 12 hours to sew all the dresses.

To find the number of hours it will take her to sew all the dresses, we multiply the number of dresses by the number of hours it takes to sew one dress:

5 dresses x 12 hours = 60 hours

So, it will take Sheena 60 hours to complete all the dresses.
