Let the cost of 1 kg of oranges be x. Let the cost of 1 kg of apples be y. We know that the cost of 1 kg of apples is 2x that of 1 kg of oranges. We can set up an equation to solve for y. 

Let's set up an equation to solve for y. The equation would be x + 2y = 12. Since we know that the cost of 1 kg of apples is 2x that of 1 kg of oranges, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation. The equation would become x + 2x = 12. 

We can solve for x in the equation. The equation is an equation of the form x + 2x = 12. We can solve the equation by subtracting 2x from both sides. The equation becomes x = 6. 

So, Betty paid 6 for 1 kg of apples.
