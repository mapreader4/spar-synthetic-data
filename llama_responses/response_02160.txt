Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say John's shirt costs x dollars.  If his shirt is 60% more than his pants, then we can set up an equation to solve for x.

x + 0.6x = 50 + x

We can subtract 50 from both sides of the equation to get:

0.4x = x

So, we know that 0.4x = x, which means that x = 125.

So, John's shirt cost 125.
