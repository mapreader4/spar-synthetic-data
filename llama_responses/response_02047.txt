Let's break it down step by step.

John buys a vacuum cleaner for $250.  The price of the vacuum cleaner is $250.

John buys a dishwasher for $450.  The price of the dishwasher is $450.

John has a $75 off coupon.  He can subtract the $75 off the total cost.

To find the total cost, we add the price of the vacuum cleaner and the price of the dishwasher, and then subtract the $75 off.

$250 + $450 = $700

$700 - $75 = $625

John spent $625.
