Let's break this down step by step.  First, we know Miles has 5 fingers on his hands.  He has 5 fingers on his hands, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 fingers on his fingers, since he has 3 fewer trumpets than fingers.  He also has 2 heads, so he has 2 + 2 = 4 trombones.  He has 2 guitars and 1 + 2 = 3 French horns, since he has one fewer French horn than guitars.  So, the total number of musical instruments Miles owns is 5 + 4 + 3 = 8.  Answer: 8.
