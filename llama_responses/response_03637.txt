Let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: First, let's find the total number of trips she needs to make. She needs to carry 17 objects, and she can carry 3 objects at a time. To find the total number of trips, we can divide 17 by 3.

So, Gretchen must make at least 6 trips to the surface of the water to carry all 17 objects.
