Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that there are 10 gallons of juice. Each gallon has 10 cups, so we can multiply 10 gallons by 10 cups to find the total number of cups: 10 x 10 = 100 cups.

Since 100 cups of juice were originally bought, but 5 cups were left, we need to subtract 5 from 100 to find the number of cups that were drunk: 100 - 5 = 95.

Answer: 95
