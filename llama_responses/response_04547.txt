Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's say the number of tickets sold during one of the three days be x.

The total amount of money earned is $4x.

The total amount of money earned is equal to the total amount of money earned on all three days. So, we can set up an equation.

4x = 3x.

Now, we can solve for x.

x = 320.

So, the number of tickets sold during one of the three days is 320.

Answer: 320
