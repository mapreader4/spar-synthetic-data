Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the distance from home to school. We are given that Shane drives 10 miles every day. Since there are 180 days in a semester, we can multiply 10 miles by 180 to find the total distance from home to school and back:

10 miles/day * 180 days = 1800 miles

Now, we can find the total distance Shane drives in an 80 day semester from home to school and back by adding the round trip distance to the total distance:

1800 miles * 2 = 3600 miles

Answer: 3600
