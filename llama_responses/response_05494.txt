Let's think step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost of the movie ticket for an adult. It's $8. The cost of a child's ticket is $3. We are told that the adult has $35 to spend.

Let's think about how much the cost of the adult's ticket would be. The cost of the adult's ticket is $8. The cost of the child's ticket is $3. The total cost of the adult's ticket is $8.

Now, let's think about how much money the adult has left over after spending on the adult's ticket. The adult has $35. The cost of the adult's ticket is $8. So, the adult has $35 - $8 = $27 left.

Now, let's think about how much the adult can spend on the child's ticket. The cost of the child's ticket is $3. The adult has $27. The cost of the child's ticket is $3. So, the adult can afford to buy the ticket for the child.

To find the number of children the adult can take, we can divide the amount the adult has left over by the cost of the child's ticket. The adult has $27. The cost of the child's ticket is $3. So, the number of children the adult can take is $27 รท $3 = 9.
