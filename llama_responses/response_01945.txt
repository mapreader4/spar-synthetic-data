Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by listing the items Diego can buy:

1. A pound of watermelon
2. A pound of grapes
3. A pound of oranges

Next, we need to find the total number of pounds of fruit Diego can buy. Let's add the pounds of each item:

1 pound of watermelon + 1 pound of grapes + 1 pound of oranges = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 pounds

So, Diego can buy 3 pounds of fruit in total.
