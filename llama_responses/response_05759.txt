Let's break it down:

Jonathan's name has 8 letters: J-O-H-N-A-T-H-A-N
Jonathan's surname has 10 letters: J-O-H-N-S-T-O-N

His sister's name has 5 letters for the first name and 10 letters for the second name. So, let's add the letters together: 5 + 10 = 15

The total number of letters in their names is 8 + 10 + 15 = 33. So, the answer is:
