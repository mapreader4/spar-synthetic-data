Let's break it down step by step.

The cost of women's haircuts is $48. The cost of children's haircuts is $36. 

Let's calculate the total cost of the haircuts: 

$48 (women's haircuts) + $36 (children's haircuts) = $84

Now, if Tayzia wants to give a 20% tip, we need to calculate 20% of the total cost:

$84 * 0.20 = $16.80

The total cost with the tip would be:

$84 + $16.80 = $100.80

So, the total cost with the tip would be $100.80.
