Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. At the beginning of the day, Kevin has 15 phones that need to be repaired.
2. Kevin successfully repairs 3 phones, leaving him with 15 - 3 = 12 phones left to repair.
3. A client drops off 6 more phones that need fixing, adding to the total number of phones Kevin needs to repair. 12 + 6 = 18 phones.
4. A coworker offers to help Kevin and fix half of the damaged phones. To find half of 18 phones, we need to divide 18 by 2: 18 รท 2 = 9.

So, Kevin will fix 9 phones and his coworker will fix the remaining 9 phones.

Answer: 9
