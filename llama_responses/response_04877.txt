Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. Brianna reads two books a month. This means that she reads a total of 2 books each month. Since she has 6 new books as a gift, that's 6 books. She bought 8 new books, so she has a total of 6 + 8 = 14 new books. She plans to borrow 2 fewer new books from the library. This means she will borrow 14 - 2 = 12 new books from the library.

2. Since she has 12 new books to read, and she already has 6 books as a gift and 8 books she bought, she has a total of 6 + 8 = 14 old books. She will need to reread 14 - 14 = 0 books to have 2 books to read a month. So, the answer is:

Answer: 0
