Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, Didi sold 10 cakes, each with 8 slices. So, she sold a total of:

10 cakes x 8 slices per cake = 80 slices

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Didi raised from selling each slice. She sold each slice for $1, so she raised:

80 slices x $1 per slice = $80

Next, a local business owner donated 50 cents for each slice sold. So, Didi raised an additional:

80 slices x 50 cents per slice = $40

Finally, a second business owner donated a quarter for each slice sold. So, Didi raised an additional:

80 slices x 25 cents per slice = $20

To find the total amount of money Didi raised, we add up the money she raised from selling each slice, plus the money she raised from the two business owners' donations:

$80 + $40 + $20 = $140

Answer: 140
