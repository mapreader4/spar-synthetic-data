Let's break this down step by step.

Paul had 80 chickens initially.

He sold 12 chickens to his neighbor before leaving the farm.

So, he had 80 - 12 = 68 chickens left.

Then, he sold 25 more chickens at the gate before the market opens.

So, he had 68 - 25 = 43 chickens left.

Answer: 43
