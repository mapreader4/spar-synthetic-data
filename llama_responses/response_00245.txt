To find the total number of pieces of fruit, we can multiply the number of crates by the number of oranges in each crate, and then add the result to the number of boxes, and then multiply the total by the number of nectarines in each box.

Number of oranges in crates: 12 x 150 = 1800
Number of nectarines in boxes: 16 x 30 = 480
Total number of fruit: 1800 + 480 = 2280

Answer: 2280
