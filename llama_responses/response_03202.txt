Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The new babysitter charges $12/hour, which is $4 less than the original babysitter ($16 - $12 = $4). So, the difference in cost per hour is $4.
2. The kids scream twice per babysitting gig, so the extra charge for screaming is $6 ($3 x 2 = $6).
3. The total cost of the new babysitter would be $12 per hour plus the extra $6 for screaming, which is $18 per hour.
4. Milly usually hires the babysitter for 6 hours, so the total cost would be $18 per hour x 6 hours, which is $108.
5. The original babysitter would cost $16 per hour x 6 hours, which is $96.
6. To find the difference in cost, subtract the new babysitter's cost from the original babysitter's cost: $108 - $96 = $12.
