Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the given information:

1. The ratio of sugar to cream cheese is 1:4.
2. The cheesecake uses 2 cups of sugar.
3. The cheesecake uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese.
4. She uses 2 teaspoons of vanilla.

From the ratio of sugar to cream cheese, we can find the total amount of cream cheese used. 2 cups of sugar is equal to 8 parts of cream cheese (since 2 cups is 8/1 of the total). So, the total amount of cream cheese is 8 parts.

From the information about vanilla, we know that 2 teaspoons of vanilla is used for every 2 cups of cream cheese. So, the total amount of vanilla used is 2/2 = 1 teaspoon for 1 part of cream cheese. Since the total amount of cream cheese is 8 parts, the total amount of vanilla used is 1 x 8 = 8 teaspoons.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs used. The cheesecake uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla for every 2 cups of cream cheese. Since 8 teaspoons of vanilla is used, we can find the total number of eggs used. 8 teaspoons of vanilla is used for 8 parts of cream cheese. So, the total number of eggs used is 8/2 = 4.
