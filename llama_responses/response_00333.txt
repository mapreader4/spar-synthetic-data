Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kantana buys 2 chocolates for herself and 1 for her sister every Saturday. That means she buys a total of 3 chocolates per Saturday.

She buys an additional 10 chocolates for her friend Charlie on the last Saturday.

So, in total, Kantana buys 3 chocolates on each of the 4 Saturdays, plus the additional 10 chocolates. That's a total of:

3 chocolates x 4 = 12 chocolates
12 + 10 = 22

Answer: 22
