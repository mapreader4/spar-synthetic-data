Let's break down the information given. We know that Tim buys 3 goats for 400 dollars each, so the total cost of the goats is 3 x 400 = 1200. He gets twice as many llamas which cost 50% more each. The llamas cost 50% more than the goats, so the cost of the llamas is 50% of 400. 50% of 400 is 200. 3 goats cost 1200 and 2 llamas cost 400, so the total cost of all the animals is 1200 + 400 = 1600.
