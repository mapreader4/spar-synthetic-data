Let's break this down step by step.

1. Brandon has 20 baseball cards.
2. Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon, so Malcom has 20 + 8 = 28 cards.
3. Malcom gives half of his cards to his friend Mark, which is 28 / 2 = 14 cards.
4. After giving away 14 cards, Malcom has 28 - 14 = 14 cards left.

Answer: 14
