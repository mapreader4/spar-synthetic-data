Let's break this problem down step by step.

Monica is saving money, so we know that she is putting money into her moneybox. Every week, she puts $15 into her moneybox. So, we can say that the total money Monica put into her moneybox is:

15 * 60 = 900

The moneybox got full after 60 weeks. So, Monica took all the money out and took it to the bank. She repeated this process 5 times. So, the total amount of money Monica took to the bank is:

900 * 5 = 4500

Answer: 4500
