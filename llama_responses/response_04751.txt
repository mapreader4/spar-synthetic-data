Let's break it down step by step:

1. Billy made 49 sandwiches.
2. Katelyn made 47 more sandwiches than Billy. So, Katelyn made 49 + 47 = 96 sandwiches.
3. Chloe made a quarter of the amount that Katelyn made. So, we need to find a quarter of 96. To find a quarter of a number, we can divide it by 4. 96 รท 4 = 24.
4. So, Chloe made 24 sandwiches.

Answer: 49 + 47 + 24 = 120.
