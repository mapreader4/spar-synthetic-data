Let's break down the information given:

1. The quarterback throws 50 passes in total.
2. He throws twice as many passes to the right as he does to the left.
3. He throws 2 more passes to the center than he did to the left.

Let's denote the number of passes to the left side of the field as x.

Since the quarterback throws twice as many passes to the right as to the left, we can write an equation to represent this information:

2x = 50 / 2 = 25

So, the number of passes to the left side is 25.

He throws 2 more passes to the center than he did to the left. So, the number of passes to the center is 25 + 2 = 27.

Now, we can add the number of passes to the left and the center:

25 + 2 = 27

So, the quarterback threw 27 passes to the left side of the field.
