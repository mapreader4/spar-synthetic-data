To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation to represent the age of Jennifer's sister Jordana. Let's say Jordana's age can be represented by the variable 'x'. 

In ten years, Jennifer will be 30 years old. So, we can set up the equation like this:

x + 10 = 30

We know that Jennifer's sister Jordana is three times Jennifer's age, so we can represent that with a multiplication factor of 3:

x = 3 * x

We can now solve for x, the current age of Jordana:

x = 30 - 10
x = 20

Jordana is currently 20 years old.
