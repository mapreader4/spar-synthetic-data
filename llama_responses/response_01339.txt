Let's break down the problem step by step.

The plumber bought 10 meters of copper and 5 meters of plastic pipe. The total number of meters is 10 + 5 = 15.

Each meter of copper costs $4, so the cost of 10 meters of copper is 10 * 4 = 40. Each meter of plastic pipe costs $4, so the cost of 5 meters of plastic pipe is 5 * 4 = 20.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of copper and plastic pipe: 40 + 20 = 60.

Answer: 60
