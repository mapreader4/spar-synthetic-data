Let's break down the problem step by step.

The woman can either buy a single 16 oz package of store-brand butter for $7, or she can buy an 8oz package of store butter for $4 and use a coupon to get an additional two 4oz packages that normally sell for $2.0 each at a 50% discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 2 additional 4oz packages with the 50% discount:

Cost of each 4oz package = $2.0
Discount = 50% of $2.0 = $1.0
Price after discount = $2.0 - $1.0 = $1.0

Total cost of 2 additional 4oz packages = 2 x $1.0 = $2.0

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the 8oz package and the 2 additional 4oz packages:

Cost of 8oz package = $4.0
Cost of 2 additional 4oz packages = $2.0
Total cost = $4.0 + $2.0 = $6.0

Since the total cost of buying the 8oz package and the 2 additional 4oz packages is $6.0, which is lower than the cost of the single 16oz package ($7.0), the woman can buy the butter at the lower price.
