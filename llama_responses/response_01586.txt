To solve this problem, we can start by converting the given time to hours and minutes to just hours. 2 hours and 20 minutes is equal to 2.3333333 hours. Then, we can divide the total distance by the time to find the speed. 

Distance = Distance / Time = Speed

Distance = 280 / 2.3333333 = 120

Answer: 120
