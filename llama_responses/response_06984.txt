Let's break it down step by step:

Yvonne wrote 400 words.
Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne, so Janna wrote 550 words.
After removing 20 words, they removed 20 words.
Adding back 2 times as many words as they removed, they added 40 words.
The original 550 - 20 is 530 words. Then add 40 to get the total number of words, which is 570.

Answer: 570
