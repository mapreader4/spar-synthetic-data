Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the total number of rhinestones Andrea needs, which is 45.

She bought a third of what she needed, which is 45 / 3 = 15.

Then, she found a fifth of what she needed in her supplies, which is 45 / 5 = 9.

So, the total amount of rhinestones she has now is 15 + 9 = 24.

To find the amount of rhinestones she still needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total amount she needs:

45 - 24 = 21

Answer: 21
