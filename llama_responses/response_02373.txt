Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of adults on the bus. The problem states that children make up 25% of the bus riders, so we can set up an equation to represent the number of children on the bus.

Let's call the number of children on the bus "x". Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

25% of the total number of riders on the bus is the number of children, which is x.

We know that the total number of riders is 60, so we can write the equation as:

0.25x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.25 to get:

x = 60 / 0.25

x = 240

So, the number of adults on the bus is 24.

Answer: 24
