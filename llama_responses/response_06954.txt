Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate how many cups of berries Martin eats in a day. Since Martin eats 1/2 cup of berries every day, and there are 1 cup in a pack, we know he eats 1/2 * 2 = 1 berries per day.

Next, we need to find out how many days are in a 30-day period. 30 days in a month.

Now, we can multiply the number of berries Martin eats per day by the number of days in a month to find the total number of berries he will eat in a 30-day period. 1 * 30 = 30 berries.

Now, we can multiply the number of berries Martin will eat in a 30-day period by the cost of 1 pack of berries to find the total cost. 30 * 2.00 = 60.00.

So, Martin will spend 60.00 on berries in a 30-day period.
