Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information: the final score is 37-23, and a touchdown is worth 7 points and a field goal is worth 3 points.

Let's say the Seattle Seahawks scored x touchdowns and y field goals. The total points for the touchdowns would be 7x, and the total points for the field goals would be 3y. The total points scored would be 7x + 3y.

We know that the total points scored by the Seattle Seahawks is 37, so we can set up an equation:

7x + 3y = 37

We can subtract 23 from both sides of the equation to get:

7x + 3y = 37 - 23

We can then subtract 23 from both sides of the equation to get:

7x = 14

So, the Seattle Seahawks scored 14 touchdowns.

Answer: 14
