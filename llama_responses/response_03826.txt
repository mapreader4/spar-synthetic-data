Let's break down the information we have. We know that Greg spent 300 dollars on a shirt and shoes, and that he spent 9 times as much on shoes as he did on a shirt. 

Let's let x be the amount spent on a shirt. Then, we can set up the equation 300 = x + 9x. 

To solve for x, we can subtract 300 from both sides of the equation. 300 - 9x = x. 

So, the amount spent on a shirt is 300 - 300 / 9 = 33. 

Answer: 33
