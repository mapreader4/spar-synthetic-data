Let's break this problem down step by step.

Anna needs 8 red tulips for each eye, which means she needs a total of 2 * 8 = 16 red tulips for the eyes.

She also needs 18 red tulips for the smile, which is the width of the face. 

To make the yellow background of the face, she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile. So, she needs 9 * 18 = 162 yellow tulips for the background.

The total number of tulips Anna needs is the sum of the number of tulips for the eyes and the background: 16 + 162 = 178.

Answer: 178
