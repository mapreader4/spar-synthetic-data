Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding Mr. Cruz's initial weight. He originally weighed 70 pounds.

In the first month, he gained 20 pounds. So, his weight after the first month is:

70 + 20 = 90

In the second month, he gained 30 pounds. So, his weight after the second month is:

90 + 30 = 120

So, Mr. Cruz's weight after the two months is 120 pounds.

Answer: 120
