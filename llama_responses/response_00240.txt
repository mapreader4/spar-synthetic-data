Let's first find the total number of bouncy balls Kate bought. Since each pack has 18 bouncy balls, and Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls and 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls, the total number of bouncy balls Kate bought is 7 * 18 + 6 * 18 = 126. 

Now, we need to find how many more red bouncy balls Kate bought than yellow bouncy balls. Since Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls and 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls, and each pack has 18 bouncy balls, Kate bought 7 * 18 = 126 - 6 * 18 = 126 - 108 = 18 red bouncy balls more than yellow bouncy balls.
