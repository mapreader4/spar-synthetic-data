Before Cameron broke his right arm, he could type 10 words per minute. In 5 minutes, he could type 10 x 5 = 50 words.

After he broke his arm, he could type 8 words per minute. In 5 minutes, he could type 8 x 5 = 40 words.

The difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is 50 - 40 = 10.
