To find the total distance Tamika drove, we can multiply the speed by the time. For Tamika, we have a speed of 45 miles per hour and a time of 8 hours, so the distance is 45 * 8 = 360 miles. For Logan, we have a speed of 55 miles per hour and a time of 5 hours, so the distance is 55 * 5 = 275 miles. The total distance Tamika drove is the sum of these two distances, which is 360 + 275 = 635 miles. Answer: 635
