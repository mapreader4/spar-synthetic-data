Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find out how many times the cat's bowl was refilled. Since the bowl is refilled every 3 days, and the cat ate for 3 days, the bowl was refilled 1 time.

The cat's original weight is 420 grams. Since the cat ate 14 grams, the remaining weight of the bowl is 420 - 14 = 406 grams.

The cat's bowl is refilled 1 time, so the total weight of the bowl is 420 grams.
