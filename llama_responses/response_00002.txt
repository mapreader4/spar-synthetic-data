Let's break this down step by step.

Betty needs $100 for the wallet, and she has half of that, so she has $50. Her parents give her $15, and her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, so that's 2 x $15 = $30. So, she now has $15 + $30 = $45. To buy the wallet, Betty needs $100 - $45 = $55 more.
