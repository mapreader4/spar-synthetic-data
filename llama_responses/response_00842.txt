Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the total amount of meatballs Antonio wants to make: 4 pounds.  Since each meatball requires 1/8 of a pound of hamburger, we can set up a proportion to find the number of meatballs he'll make: 4 pounds / 1/8 = 32.

Since there are 8 family members, each of whom will eat an equal number of meatballs, we can set up a proportion to find the number of meatballs each person will eat: 32 / 8 = 4.

So, the number of meatballs Antonio will eat is 4.
