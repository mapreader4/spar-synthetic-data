Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Omi is twice as old as Kimiko.
* Arlette is 3/4 times as old as Kimiko.

We can use the information that Kimiko is 28 years old to set up an equation to solve for the age of Omi and Arlette.

Since Omi is twice as old as Kimiko, that means Omi is 2 x 28 = 56 years old.

Arlette is 3/4 times as old as Kimiko, so Arlette is 3/4 x 28 = 21 years old.

Now, to find the average age of the three, we add up the ages and divide by 3:

(56 + 21 + 28) / 3 = 35

So, the average age is 35.

Answer: 35
