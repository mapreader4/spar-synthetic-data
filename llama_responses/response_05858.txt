Let's break it down step by step.

Marion's bike costs $356.

Stephanie's bike is worth twice as much, so we can multiply $356 by 2 to find the price of her bike. $356 * 2 = $712.

Now, we need to find the total price of their bikes. We can add the cost of Marion's bike to the cost of Stephanie's bike. $356 + $712 = $1068.

Answer: 1068
