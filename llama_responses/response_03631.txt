Let's think about this step by step.

Let's start by identifying what we know:

1. Codger has 3 shoes.
2. He wants to buy 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes.
3. The stores only sell shoes in pairs.

To have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes he needs.

Let's find the number of pairs of shoes he needs:

3-piece set of shoes = 3 shoes
5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes = 5 x 3-piece sets of shoes

So, to have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes, Codger needs to buy:

3-piece set of shoes = 3 shoes
3-piece set of shoes = 3 shoes
3-piece set of shoes = 3 shoes
3-piece set of shoes = 3 shoes
3-piece set of shoes = 3 shoes

In total, he needs to buy 15 shoes.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 15
