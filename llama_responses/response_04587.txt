Let's break this down step by step:

Chantel makes 2 friendship bracelets every day for 5 days. So she makes a total of 2 x 5 = 10 bracelets.

Then, she gives away 3 bracelets to her friends at school. So she has 10 - 3 = 7 bracelets left.

Next, she makes 3 friendship bracelets every day for 4 days. So she makes a total of 3 x 4 = 12 bracelets. Then, she gives away 6 bracelets to her friends at soccer practice. So she has 7 - 6 = 1 bracelet left.

So, in the end, Chantel has 1 bracelet left.
