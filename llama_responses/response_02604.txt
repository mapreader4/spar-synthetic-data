Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying how many stickers Andrew gave away.

Daniel received 250 stickers, so that's 250 stickers taken away from the 750 total stickers Andrew had.

Fred received 120 more stickers than Daniel. So, Fred received 120 + 250 = 370 stickers.

Andrew kept the remaining stickers, which is 750 - 250 - 370 = 380.

Answer: 380
