Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine the initial number of each type of silverware Stephanie wants to buy.

* Spoons: 5
* Butter knives: 5
* Steak knives: 5
* Forks: 5

Total initial number: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20

Step 2: Determine the number of extra pieces Stephanie wants to buy.

* Spoons: 10
* Butter knives: 10
* Steak knives: 10
* Forks: 10

Total extra number: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Step 3: Add the initial number and the extra number to get the total number of each type of silverware.

* Spoons: 5 + 10 = 15
* Butter knives: 5 + 10 = 15
* Steak knives: 5 + 10 = 15
* Forks: 5 + 10 = 15

Step 4: Determine the number of each type of silverware Stephanie decides to buy after adjusting the quantities.

* Spoons: 15 - 4 = 11
* Butter knives: 15 - 4 = 11
* Steak knives: 15 - 5 = 10
* Forks: 15 - 3 = 12

Step 5: Add up the number of each type of silverware to get the total number of silverware Stephanie will buy.

* Spoons: 11
* Butter knives: 11
* Steak knives: 10
* Forks: 12

Total number of silverware: 11 + 11 + 10 + 12 = 44

Answer: 44
