Let's break this problem down step by step.

Day 1: Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.

Day 2: She spends 2 times the time she spent on the phone the day before, so she spends 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.

Day 3: She spends 2 times the time she spent on the phone the day before, so she spends 10 * 2 = 20 minutes.

Day 4: She spends 2 times the time she spent on the phone the day before, so she spends 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.

Day 5: Her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long, so she doesn't spend any time on the phone.

To find the total time Jill spent talking to her boyfriend, we need to add up the time she spent on each day:

5 + 10 + 20 + 40 = 75

Answer: 75
