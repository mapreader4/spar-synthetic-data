To solve this problem, we can let x be the distance that Hiro walked. Then, Rajesh walked 10 kilometers less than 4 times that distance. So, the equation is 10 + x - 4x = 25.

We can solve this equation by adding 4x to both sides, so the equation becomes 5x = 25. Then, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 5, so x = 5.

Answer: 5
