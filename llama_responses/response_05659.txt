Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. In October, there were 100 visitors.
2. The number of visitors in November increased by 15%. So, the number of visitors in November is 100 + (15% of 100) = 100 + 15 = 115.
3. In December, there were 15 more visitors than in November. So, the number of visitors in December is 115 + 15 = 130.
4. To find the total number of visitors for these three months, we add the number of visitors in October, November, and December: 100 + 115 + 130 = 345.

Answer: 345
