Let's break it down step by step.

Tom needs 10 different vaccines, each of which costs $45, so the total cost of the vaccines is 10 x 45 = $450. The doctor's visit costs $250, and insurance will cover 80% of the total medical bills. 80% of 450 + 250 is 0.8 x 700 = 560, so insurance will cover $560 of the total cost.  So, Tom will have to pay the remaining amount. The total cost of the trip is $1200, and insurance covered $560, so Tom will have to pay $1200 - $560 = $640.

Answer: 640
