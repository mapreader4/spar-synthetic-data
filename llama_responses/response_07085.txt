Let's break this problem down step by step.

Classroom A has raised:

* $20 from each of 2 families = 2 x $20 = $40
* $10 from each of 8 families = 8 x $10 = $80
* $5 from each of 10 families = 10 x $5 = $50

In total, Classroom A has raised $40 + $80 + $50 = $170.

The goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need, we need to subtract the amount they have from the goal:

$200 - $170 = $30

Answer: 30
