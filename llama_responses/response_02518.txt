To find the amount of MB of data Elsa has left, we need to subtract the amount of data used for YouTube and Facebook from the total amount of data.

Elsa gets 500 MB of cell phone data each month. She spends 300 MB watching YouTube and 2/5 of what's left on Facebook. 

Let's convert the fraction 2/5 to a decimal: 2/5 = 0.4. So, Elsa spends 0.4 MB on Facebook.

So, Elsa spends a total of 300 MB on YouTube and 0.4 MB on Facebook, which is 300.4 MB.

So, the amount of data left is 500 - 300.4 = 199.6 MB.

Answer: 199.6
