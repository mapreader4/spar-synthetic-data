Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of blouses Brie needs to wash.

Brie has 12 blouses in her closet, and she has 75% of those in her hamper. To find the number of blouses in her hamper, we multiply 12 by 75% to get:

12 x 0.75 = 9

So, Brie needs to wash 9 blouses.

Next, let's calculate the number of skirts she needs to wash.

Brie has 6 skirts in her closet, and she has 50% of those in her hamper. To find the number of skirts in her hamper, we multiply 6 by 50% to get:

6 x 0.5 = 3

So, Brie needs to wash 3 skirts.

Finally, let's calculate the number of slacks she needs to wash.

Brie has 8 slacks in her closet, and she has 25% of those in her hamper. To find the number of slacks in her hamper, we multiply 8 by 25% to get:

8 x 0.25 = 2

So, Brie needs to wash 2 slacks.

In total, Brie needs to wash 9 blouses, 3 skirts, and 2 slacks, which is a total of:

9 + 3 + 2 = 14

Answer: 14
