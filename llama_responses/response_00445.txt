To find the cost of 2 bags of peanut butter cups, we need to find 75% off the cost of 1 bag. 

1 bag of peanut butter cups was $6.00. 

We can find 75% off 1 bag by multiplying 1 bag by 0.75. 

1 * 6.00 * 0.75 = 4.50

The cost of 1 bag is 4.50. 

For 2 bags, we need to multiply 4.50 by 2. 

4.50 * 2 = 9.00

So, the cost of 2 bags of peanut butter cups is 9.00.
