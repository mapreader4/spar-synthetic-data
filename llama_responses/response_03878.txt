Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of candy bars sold. Each member sold an average of 8 candy bars, and there are 20 members in the group. So, the total number of candy bars sold is:

20 members * 8 candy bars per member = 160 candy bars.

Now, each candy bar costs $0.50. So, the total amount of money earned is:

160 candy bars * $0.50 per candy bar = 80 dollars.

So, the answer is: Answer: 80
