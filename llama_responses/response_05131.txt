Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first identify the information given to us:

* Connor scored 2 points.
* Amy scored 4 more points than Connor, so Amy scored 2 + 4 = 6 points.
* Jason scored twice the score of Amy, which is 6 * 2 = 12 points.

To find the total score of their team, we add Connor's 2 points to Amy's 6 points and Jason's 12 points. So, the total score is 2 + 6 + 12 = 20.

Answer: 20
