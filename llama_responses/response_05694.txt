Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the length of the first movie: 2 hours.

Next, the second movie is 50% longer than the first movie. 50% of 2 hours is 1 hour. 50% of 2 hours is 1 hour. 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours. So, the length of the second movie is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

The third movie is 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous 2 movies. 2 + 3 hours = 5 hours. So, the length of the third movie is 5 - 1 = 4 hours.

To find the total length of the movie marathon, we add the length of the three movies: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 hours. So, the answer is: Answer: 9
