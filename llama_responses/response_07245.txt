Let's break this down step by step.

Olivia gave William 10 napkins. So, William now has 10 napkins.

Amelia gave William twice the number of napkins Olivia gave him, so Amelia gave William 10 * 2 = 20 napkins.

William had 15 napkins before, and he now has 10 napkins from Olivia and 20 napkins from Amelia, so William has 10 + 20 = 30 napkins now.

Answer: 30
