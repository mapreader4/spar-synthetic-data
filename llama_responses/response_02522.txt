Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of one large puzzle. The cost of a large puzzle is given to be $15.

Next, let's find the cost of one small puzzle. The cost of a small puzzle is given to be $3.

Now, let's find the cost of 1 large and 3 small puzzles. Since we already know the cost of 1 large puzzle is $15, and the cost of 1 small puzzle is $3, we can find the cost of 1 large and 3 small puzzles by multiplying the cost of 1 large puzzle by 3, and then adding the cost of 3 small puzzles.

So, the cost of 1 large and 3 small puzzles would be:

15 * 3 + 3 = 45

Answer: 45
