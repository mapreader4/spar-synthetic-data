Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. The problem states that 20% of the students are in the band. We are trying to find the number of students who go to the middle school. We can use the information that 20% of the students are in the band. We can start by converting the percentage to a decimal: 20% = 0.2. We know that 0.2 is the decimal equivalent of 20%.

Next, we know that the total number of students is 168. We can multiply the total number of students by the decimal 0.2 to get the number of students who go to the middle school: 168 * 0.2 = 33.2. We can round this number down to the nearest whole number, which is 33. Answer: 33.
