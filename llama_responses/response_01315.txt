Let's break this down step by step.

Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven at once, so the total number of pies in the oven is 5.

Marcus bakes 7 batches of pies, which means there are 7 * 5 = 35 pies in total.

Marcus then slips and drops 8 of them, which leaves 35 - 8 = 27 pies left.

Answer: 27
