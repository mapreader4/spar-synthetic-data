Let's break this problem down step by step.

On Monday, Daniel delivers 20 yards of fabric. On Tuesday, he delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivers on Monday, so he delivers 20 * 2 = 40 yards of fabric. On Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday, which is 40 / 4 = 10 yards of fabric.

The total amount of fabric delivered is 20 + 40 + 10 = 70 yards. Since each yard of fabric costs $2, the total cost of the fabric is 70 * 2 = $140.

The cost of yarn is 1/2 of the cost of fabric, so it is 140 / 2 = $70.

Answer: 70
