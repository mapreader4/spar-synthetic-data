Let's break down the problem step by step.

Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream. To make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, she will need to make 2 quarts of ice cream.

For the berries, she will need 8 cups (4 cups for strawberry and 4 cups for raspberry). Since the berries come in 2 cup packages, she will need 4 packages (8 cups / 2 cups per package).

The cost of the berries is 4 packages x $3.00 per package = $12.00.

For the heavy cream, she will need 4 cups (2 cups for strawberry and 2 cups for raspberry). Since the heavy cream comes in 4 cup containers, she will need 1 container.

The cost of the heavy cream is $4.00 per container.

In total, the cost of the berries and heavy cream is $12.00 + $4.00 = $16.00.
