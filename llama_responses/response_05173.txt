Let's break it down step by step.

1. The first side has 6 songs, each 4 minutes long, so the total time for the first side is 6 x 4 = 24 minutes.
2. The second side has 4 songs, each 4 minutes long, so the total time for the second side is 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.
3. The total time for the mixtape is the sum of the times of the two sides: 24 + 16 = 40 minutes.

Answer: 40
