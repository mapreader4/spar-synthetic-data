Let's break down the number of pies baked per day into two variables: number of apple pies and number of cherry pies. 

Let the number of apple pies be A and the number of cherry pies be C.

We know that the total number of pies baked per week is 12, and the number of apple pies and number of cherry pies are equal to 12.

So, we have the following equations:

A + C = 12

We know that Steve bakes apple pies on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, so the number of apple pies is 3 * A. Steve bakes cherry pies on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so the number of cherry pies is 2 * C.

We can substitute the given values of A and C into the equations:

3 * A + 2 * C = 12

Now we need to solve for A and C.

We can solve for A first, because we know that 3 * A = 12 - 2 * C.

A = (12 - 2 * C) / 3

A = 4

Now we know that A = 4. So, the number of apple pies baked per day is 4.

We can now substitute A into the equation for C:

4 + C = 12

C = (12 - 4) / 2

C = 4

So, the number of cherry pies baked per day is 4.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of apple pies and number of cherry pies baked per day:

Number of apple pies - Number of cherry pies = 4 - 4

Number of apple pies - Number of cherry pies = 0
