Let's break it down step by step.

If it takes 8 days for 3 builders to build a cottage, then the rate of building is 8 days / 3 builders = 8/3 = 2.67 days per builder.

If 6 builders are working at the same rate, then it will take 2.67 days per builder. So, to build the same size cottage, it will take:

8 days / 2.67 builders = 3.00 days

So, the answer is: Answer: 3
