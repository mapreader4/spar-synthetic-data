Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: Carla had 400 chickens and 40% of the chickens died due to a disease. Let's call the number of chickens that died "x". Then, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

The equation would be: 400 - x = 40% of 400

To solve for x, we can multiply 40% by 400 by 10 to get 10 times as many chickens as the number that died due to the disease.

40% of 400 = 0.4 x 400 = x

Now, we can multiply 0.4 by 400 to get:

0.4 x 400 = 160

So, x = 160.

Answer: 160
