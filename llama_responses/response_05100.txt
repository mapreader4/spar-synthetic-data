Let's break this problem down step by step.

Malcolm has an unknown number of white lights initially.

He buys 12 red lights, which means he now has 12 fewer white lights.

Then, he buys 3 times as many blue lights as red lights, so he buys 12 x 3 = 36 blue lights. He now has 36 fewer white lights.

Next, he buys 6 green lights, so he has 36 - 6 = 30 fewer white lights.

So, if he still has 5 colored lights left to buy, that means he initially had 30 + 5 = 35 white lights.

Answer: 35
