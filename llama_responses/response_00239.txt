Let's break this down step by step.

Frank has a total of 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 12 dollars in bills. He has a total of 12 dollars.

He spends 12 dollars on peanuts, which costs 3 dollars per pound. To find the total number of pounds, we can set up a proportion. Let's do that.

Let x be the number of pounds. The total cost of the peanuts is 12 dollars, and the cost per pound is 3 dollars. So, we can set up the proportion as follows:

12 = 3x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3.

12 รท 3 = 4

So, Frank eats 4 pounds in total. Since he eats the peanuts in one week, we can find the number of pounds he eats per day by dividing the total pounds by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

4 รท 7 = 0.57

So, Frank eats 0.57 pounds of peanuts per day.
