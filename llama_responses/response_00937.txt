Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, I need to find 30% of the original price of the dress. To do this, I can multiply the original price by 0.3.

50 x 0.3 = 15

So, 30% of the original price is 15.

Now, I need to subtract this amount from the original price to find the final cost of the dress.

50 - 15 = 35

Answer: 35
