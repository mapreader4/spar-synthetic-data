Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

* Legacy has 5 bars of gold.
* Aleena has 2 bars fewer than Legacy.
* A bar of gold is worth $2200.

Since Legacy has 5 bars, and Aleena has 2 bars fewer than Legacy, we can find the number of bars Aleena has by subtracting 2 from 5:

5 - 2 = 3

So, Aleena has 3 bars of gold.

The total number of bars of gold the three have together is the sum of the number of bars each has:

5 (Legacy) + 3 (Aleena) = 8

Now, we can multiply the number of bars by the value of a bar to find the total value of gold:

8 x $2200 = $17600

Answer: 17600
