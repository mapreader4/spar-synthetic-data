Let's start by identifying the ages of the three people. Since Jenny is 5 years older than Charlie, we can write an equation to represent the age of Jenny. Let's say Jenny's age is x + 5, and Charlie's age is x. Then, we know that Charlie is 3 years older than Jenny, so we can write another equation to represent Charlie's age. Charlie's age is x + 3.

Now, we know that Jenny's age is 5 years older than Charlie's age, so we can write an equation to represent Jenny's age in terms of Charlie's age. Jenny's age is x + 5 = Charlie's age + 5 - 3. We know that Jenny's age is 5 years older than Charlie's age, so we can simplify the equation to get Jenny's age in terms of Charlie's age. Jenny's age is Charlie's age + 2.

Now, we want to find when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby. We know that Bobby's age is x + 3. When Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby, Jenny's age will be 2 times Bobby's age, or 2 x (x + 3). We can solve the equation to find the age of Jenny when she becomes twice as old as Bobby. 2 x (x + 3) = 2x + 6.

So, when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby, she will be 2x + 6 years old.
