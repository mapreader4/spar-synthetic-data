Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the given information: Nunzio eats 3 pieces of pizza every day for lunch.

We can represent this as a fraction. 3 pieces of pizza represents one-eighth of the entire pie. So, if Nunzio eats 3 pieces of pizza, that is 3/1 of the entire pie.

Now, we can multiply this fraction by 72 days to find the total number of pizzas Nunzio eats in 72 days. 3/1 * 72 = 216.

So, Nunzio eats 216 pieces of pizza in 72 days.

Answer: 216
