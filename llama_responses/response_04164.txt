Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of one kilogram of tomatoes. We know that one kilogram of cucumbers costs $5, so we can use that to find the cost of one kilogram of tomatoes. One kilogram of tomatoes is 20% cheaper than one kilogram of cucumbers. So, if one kilogram of cucumbers is $5, then one kilogram of tomatoes is 0.8 x $5 = $4. So, one kilogram of tomatoes costs $4.

Now, let's find the cost of two kilograms of tomatoes. We know that two times one kilogram of tomatoes is 2 x $4 = $8.

Now, let's find the cost of three kilograms of cucumbers. We know that three kilograms of cucumbers is 3 x $5 = $15.

So, the total cost of two kilograms of tomatoes and three kilograms of cucumbers is $8 + $15 = $23.
