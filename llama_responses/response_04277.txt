Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the numbers given in the problem:

* Stores: 2000
* Hospitals: 500
* Schools: 200
* Police stations: 20

The problem states that the new city should have half the number of stores, twice as many hospitals, 50 fewer schools, and 5 more police stations.

Let's calculate the new numbers:

* Stores: 2000 / 2 = 1000
* Hospitals: 500 * 2 = 1000
* Schools: 200 - 50 = 150
* Police stations: 20 + 5 = 25

Now, let's add up the new numbers:

1000 + 1000 + 150 + 25 = 2185

Answer: 2185
