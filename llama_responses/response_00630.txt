Let's start by setting up the ratio of red to blue candles as 5:3. We know that the ratio of red to blue is 5:3, so we can write an equation to represent this ratio. Let's use the variable r for the number of red candles and b for the number of blue candles. The equation for this ratio is r:b = 5:3. We know that Avianna has 45 red candles, so we can substitute the value of r with 45 into the equation. This gives us the equation 45:b = 5:3. We can solve for b by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3 to get b = 45 / 5 = 9. The answer is 9.
