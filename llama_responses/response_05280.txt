Let's break down the problem step by step.

Haman's father sends him to collect 10 trays of eggs. He drops 2 trays, so he has 10 - 2 = 8 trays left.

He is told to add 7 more trays for sale, so he adds 7 trays to the 8 trays he already has. 8 + 7 = 15 trays.

So, 15 trays of eggs were sold that day.
