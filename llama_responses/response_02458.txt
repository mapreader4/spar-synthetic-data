Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's find Robert's total earnings for the month. His basic salary is $1250, and he earned 10% commission on his sales of $23600. The commission is 10% of 23600, which is 2360. So, his total earnings are 1250 + 2360 = 3610.

Next, Robert allocated 20% of his total earnings to savings. 20% of 3610 is 722.

Now, to find his monthly expenses, we subtract the amount allocated to savings from his total earnings. His expenses are 3610 - 722 = 2888.

Answer: 2888
