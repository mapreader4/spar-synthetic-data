Let's start by identifying the information given. We know that Moonglow Orchard has 14 pumpkins. We are asked to find the number of pumpkins at Sunshine Orchard, which is more than three times the number of pumpkins at Moonglow Orchard.

We can represent the number of pumpkins at Sunshine Orchard as x. Then we can write the equation as 3x = 14. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. 

3x = 14
x = 14/3
x = 4.67

So, there are 4.67 pumpkins at Sunshine Orchard.
