Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of buckets of fish that each group of animals receives.

* Sharks: 4 buckets
* Dolphins: 2 buckets (since they are fed half as many buckets as the sharks)
* Other sea animals: 20 buckets (since they are fed 5 times as many buckets as the sharks)

Now, let's calculate the total number of buckets of fish that are fed in a day:

4 (sharks) + 2 (dolphins) + 20 (other sea animals) = 26

So, in a week, 7 days, the total number of buckets of fish that will be fed is:

26 * 7 = 182

So, the answer is:

Answer: 182
