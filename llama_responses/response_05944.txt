Let's start by calculating the total number of crops the farmer should have without any destruction.

For corn stalks, each row should produce 9 corn cobs, and the farmer has 10 rows. So, the total number of corn cobs the farmer should have is:

10 rows x 9 corn cobs/row = 90 corn cobs

For potatoes, each row should produce 30 potatoes, and the farmer has 5 rows. So, the total number of potatoes the farmer should have is:

5 rows x 30 potatoes/row = 150 potatoes

Now, let's calculate the total number of crops the farmer should have without any destruction:

90 corn cobs + 150 potatoes = 240 crops

However, the farmer thinks that half of his crops have been destroyed by the pests. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total number of crops and subtract that from the total:

50% of 240 crops = 0.5 x 240 = 120 crops

Now, let's subtract the destroyed crops from the total:

240 crops - 120 crops = 120 crops

Answer: 120
