Let's start by using the information that Sue has 7 purple beads. If she has 7 purple beads, and 7 is twice as many purple beads as blue beads, then she has 7/2 = 3.5 blue beads. Since she has 11 more green beads than blue beads, she has 11 - 3.5 = 7.5 green beads.

So, the total number of beads in the necklace is 7 + 3 + 7.5 = 17.5. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a bead, we must round the answer down to the nearest whole number. In this case, the total number of beads is 18.
