Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 50 racers in the race.

After 20 minutes, 30 more racers joined the race. So, the total number of racers is 50 + 30 = 80.

After another 30 minutes, the total number of racers doubled. So, the total number of racers is 80 * 2 = 160.

At the end of the race, only 130 people finished the race. So, the number of people who dropped before finishing the race is 160 - 130 = 30.

Answer: 30.
