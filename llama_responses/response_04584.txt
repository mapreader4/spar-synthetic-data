Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by letting b be the number of fish that Blaine caught. Since Keith caught twice as many fish as Blaine, Keith caught 2b fish. Then, we know that the total number of fish they caught together is the sum of the number of fish Keith caught and the number of fish Blaine caught. So, the total number of fish they caught is 3b.

So, the total number of fish they caught is 3b.
