To solve this problem, let's start by finding the height of the first rocket. The problem states that it can travel 500 feet in the air. So, the height of the first rocket is 500 feet.

The second rocket is described as traveling twice as high as the first one. This means that it travels 2 * 500 feet, or 1000 feet in the air.

The combined height of the two rockets is the sum of their heights, which is 500 + 1000. This is 1500 feet.

Answer: 1500
