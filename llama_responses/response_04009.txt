Let's start by identifying the total number of cards Jim gave away.

Jim gave 8 sets to his brother.
8 sets of cards = 8 x 13 = 104 cards

Jim gave 5 sets to his sister.
5 sets of cards = 5 x 13 = 65 cards

Jim gave 2 sets to his friend.
2 sets of cards = 2 x 13 = 26 cards

The total number of cards Jim gave away is the sum of the number of cards he gave to his brother, his sister, and his friend.
104 + 65 + 26 = 195

Answer: 195
