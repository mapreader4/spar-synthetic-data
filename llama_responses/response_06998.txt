Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many pages she has left to read. We know she is currently at page 90, and the book has 210 pages. So, she has 210 - 90 = 120 pages left to read.

Now, we know she reads at a steady pace. So, we need to find out how many hours she reads in 1 hour. Let's call this rate r. We don't know what r is, but we can find it out. An hour ago, she was at page 60. So, we know she read 60 pages in 1 hour. We can use this information to find out how many hours she reads in 1 hour. Let's divide 60 by r to get the number of hours she reads in 1 hour. 60 / r = x.

Now, we know she has 120 pages left to read. We know she reads x pages in 1 hour. So, we can multiply the number of hours she reads in 1 hour by the number of hours it will take her to finish the book. 120 / x = t. Now, we can multiply t by the number of hours it takes to read the book. t * 1 = t. t = 120 / x * 1 = 12.

So, the answer is 12 hours. Answer: 12
