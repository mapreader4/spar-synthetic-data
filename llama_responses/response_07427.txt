Let's break this down step by step.

Let's let x be Joey's current age.

We know that Joey is 9 now, so we can say that x = 9.

Now, we need to find out how old Beth is now. We know that in 5 years, Joey will be as old as Beth is now. So, if we subtract 5 from Joey's current age, we'll get Beth's current age.

Let's subtract 5 from 9, which gives us 4.

So, Beth is 4 years old now.

Answer: 4
