Let's start by letting x be the cost of the old car. We know that the new car cost twice as much as the old car, so the cost of the new car is 2x. We know that the new car cost 2000 dollars more than the old car, so we know that 2x + 2000 = 1800. So we can subtract 2000 from both sides of the equation to get x + 0 = 1800. This gives us that x = 900. So the old car cost 900 dollars. 

Answer: 900
