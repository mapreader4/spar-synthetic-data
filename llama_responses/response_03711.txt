Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the number of apples Katherine has in her fridge. She has 4 apples.

Next, let's find the number of pears she has in her fridge. She has 3 times as many pears as apples, which means she has 3 * 4 = 12 pears.

Now, let's add the number of apples and pears to find the total number of pieces of fruit she has. 4 + 12 = 16.

Answer: 16
