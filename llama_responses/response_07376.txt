Let's break it down step by step.

Janette started with 40 pieces of beef jerky.

For 5 days, she eats 1 for breakfast, 1 for lunch, and 2 for dinner each day. That means she eats a total of 4 pieces per day. So, for 5 days, she eats a total of 4 * 5 = 20 pieces.

She gives half of the remaining pieces to her brother. So, she has 40 - 20 = 20 pieces left.

Answer: 20
