Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of open parking spots on each level:

* First level: 58 open spots
* Second level: 58 + 2 = 60 open spots (since there are 2 more open spots on the second level than on the first)
* Third level: 60 + 5 = 65 open spots (since there are 5 more open spots on the third level than on the second)
* Fourth level: 31 open spots

To find the total number of open parking spots, we need to add the number of open spots on each level:

58 + 60 + 65 + 31 = 214

So, there are 214 open parking spots in all.
