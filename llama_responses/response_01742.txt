Let's calculate the average number of calls Jean answers per day.

On Monday, Jean answered 35 calls.
On Tuesday, Jean answered 46 calls.
On Wednesday, Jean answered 27 calls.
On Friday, Jean answered 31 calls.

To find the average number of calls Jean answers per day, we can add up the total number of calls she answered, then divide by the number of days.

Total number of calls = 35 + 46 + 27 + 61 + 31 = 159

Number of days = 4

Average number of calls per day = 159 / 4 = 39.75

Answer: 39
