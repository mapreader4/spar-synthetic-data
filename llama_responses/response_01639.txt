Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's assume that Andy blew up balloons for 50 minutes, and he blew 2 balloons every 5 minutes. 

Since Andy blew 50 balloons, and he blew 2 balloons every 5 minutes, we can divide 50 by 2 to get the number of times he blew balloons: 50 รท 2 = 25.

So, Andy blew balloons for 25 times, or for 25 minutes.

Answer: 25
