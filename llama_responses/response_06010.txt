Let's break this problem down step by step.

James can lift 300 pounds per hand for 20 meters, so for 10 meters, he can lift 300 * (10/20) = 150 pounds per hand.

If he can lift 30% more for 10 meters, that means he can lift 150 * (1.3) = 195 pounds per hand for 10 meters.

With lifting straps, he can lift 20% more, so that's 195 * (1.2) = 234 pounds per hand for 10 meters.

Now, if he increases his 20-meter distance without straps by 50 pounds, that means he can lift 300 * (1 + 50/300) = 350 pounds per hand for 20 meters without straps.

The question asks about lifting straps for 10 meters, so we need to scale up the lifting amount by 2/3. That's 234 * (2/3) = 156 pounds per hand for 10 meters with lifting straps.

Answer: 156
