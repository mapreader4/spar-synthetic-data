Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the cost per day: $50.00.

If Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days, we need to multiply the daily cost by the number of days:

$50.00 (cost per day) x 20 (number of days) =?

To find the total cost, we multiply 50.00 by 20:

50.00 x 20 = 1000.00

So, the total cost for Eric to rent the house for 20 days would be:

Answer: 1000.00
