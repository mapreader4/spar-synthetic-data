To find the height in inches, we can calculate the difference between the height on the 12th birthday and the height on the 8th birthday.

Height on 8th birthday: 50 inches
Height on 12th birthday = Height on 8th birthday + (12 - 8) * (1/2) = 50 + 1 = 51

So, Alexander will be 51 inches tall on his 12th birthday.
