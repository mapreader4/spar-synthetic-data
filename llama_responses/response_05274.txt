Let's break it down step by step:

1. Toms car gets 50 miles to the gallon. So, if he drives 75 miles per day, we can find out how many gallons of gas he uses in a day:

75 miles / 50 miles per gallon = 1.5 gallons

2. If he drives 75 miles per day, then in 10 days, he will drive a total of:

75 miles x 10 days = 750 miles

3. Now, to find out how much he will spend on gas, we need to multiply the total miles driven by the cost of gas per gallon:

750 miles x $3 per gallon = $2,250

So, Tom will spend $2,250 on gas in 10 days.
