To find the total number of seeds in the watermelon, we can multiply the number of slices by the number of seeds per slice.

There are 40 slices. Each slice has 20 black seeds and 20 white seeds. So, for each slice, the total number of seeds is 40.

To find the total number of seeds in the watermelon, we multiply 40 (number of slices) by 40 (number of seeds per slice):

40 x 40 = 1600

Answer: 1600
