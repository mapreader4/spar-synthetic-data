Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many tadpoles there are. Since there are 3 times as many tadpoles as fish, and there are 50 fish, that means there are 3 x 50 = 150 tadpoles.

Curtis catches 7 fish, so the number of fish decreases by 7. So, there are now 50 - 7 = 43 fish in the pond.

Now, half the tadpoles develop into frogs, so half of 150 tadpoles develop into frogs. Half of 150 is 75.

To find out how many tadpoles are left, we subtract the number of tadpoles that developed into frogs from the total number of tadpoles: 150 - 75 = 75 tadpoles.

So, there are 75 tadpoles left. To find out how many more tadpoles there are than fish, we subtract the number of tadpoles from the number of fish: 75 - 43 = 32.

Answer: 32
