Let's break this down step by step.

First, 500 people showed up and took 1 can of food each. This means Carla gave away 500 cans of food.

Then, Carla restocked with 1500 more cans of food. This doesn't change the number of cans she gave away, so we can ignore this step for now.

The next day, 1000 people showed up and took 2 cans of food each. This means Carla gave away 1000 x 2 = 2000 cans of food.

So, in total, Carla gave away 500 + 2000 = 2500 cans of food.

Answer: 2500
