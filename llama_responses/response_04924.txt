Let's break this down step by step.

Diane starts with $100.

She wins 5 hands for a total of $65, so she now has:

$100 + $65 = $165

Then, she loses all her money and owes her friends $50. To find out how much she lost, we subtract the amount she owed from the amount she had:

$165 - $50 = $115

So, Diane lost $115.
