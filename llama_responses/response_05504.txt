Let's break this down step by step.

Thomas starts with 200 books and sells them for $1.5 each. To find out how much money he makes, we can multiply 200 by 1.5.

200 * 1.5 = 300

Thomas makes 300 dollars.

Next, he uses this money to buy records. Each record costs $3, so to find out how many records he can buy, we can divide 300 by 3.

300 รท 3 = 100

Thomas can buy 100 records.

Finally, to find out how much money he has left over, we subtract the cost of the records from the money he made.

300 - (100 * 3) = 200

Thomas has 200 dollars left over.
