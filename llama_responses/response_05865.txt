Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Let's find the total number of rotten apples. We know that 40% of the 200 apples are rotten. To find the total number of rotten apples, we can multiply 40% with the total number of apples:

40% * 200 = 80

So, 80 apples are rotten.

Step 2: Now, we need to find the number of rotten apples that don't smell. We know that 70% of the rotten apples smell. To find the number of rotten apples that don't smell, we can subtract 70% from the total number of rotten apples:

80 - 70 = 10

So, 10 apples in the orchard did not smell.

Answer: 10
