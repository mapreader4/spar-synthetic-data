Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that John is 15 cm taller than Lena and 6 cm shorter than Rebeca. This means that John's height is 15 cm more than Lena's height and 6 cm less than Rebeca's height.
2. We are given John's height, which is 152 cm. This means that John's height is 152 cm.
3. Since John is 15 cm taller than Lena, and John's height is 152 cm, we can subtract 15 cm from 152 cm to find Lena's height: 152 cm - 15 cm = 137 cm.
4. Since John is 6 cm shorter than Rebeca, and John's height is 137 cm, we can add 6 cm to 137 cm to find Rebeca's height: 137 cm + 6 cm = 143 cm.
5. Finally, we can add the heights of Lena and Rebeca together: 137 cm + 143 cm = 280 cm.

Answer: 280
