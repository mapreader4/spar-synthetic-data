Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of clothes Cally has:

* White shirts: 10
* Colored shirts: 5
* Shorts: 7
* Pants: 6
Total clothes for Cally: 10 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 28

Next, let's find the total number of clothes Danny has:

* White shirts: 6
* Colored shirts: 8
* Shorts: 10
* Pants: 6
Total clothes for Danny: 6 + 8 + 10 + 6 = 30

Now, let's add the total number of clothes Cally and Danny have:

28 + 30 = 58

So, Cally and Danny washed a total of 58 clothes.
