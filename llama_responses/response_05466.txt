Let's break down the information given into smaller parts.

Grady has 20 red numbered cubes and 15 blue numbered cubes. Gage gets 2/5 of the red numbered cubes, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 red numbered cubes. Gage also gets 1/3 of the blue numbered cubes, which is 1/3 * 15 = 5 blue numbered cubes. So, Gage has 8 red numbered cubes and 5 blue numbered cubes.

To find the total number of cubes Gage has, we add the number of red cubes and blue cubes together: 8 + 5 = 13.
