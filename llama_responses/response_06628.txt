Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of paintings each group of customers bought.

* 4 customers bought 2 paintings each, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 paintings.
* The next 12 customers bought 1 painting each, so that's 12 x 1 = 12 paintings.
* The last 4 customers bought 4 paintings each, so that's 4 x 4 = 16 paintings.

To find the total number of paintings sold, we add the paintings from each group: 8 + 12 + 16 = 36.

Answer: 36
