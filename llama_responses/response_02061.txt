Let's break this down step by step.

The field is in the shape of a rectangle, so we can find the distance each player will run by finding the perimeter of the rectangle.

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Since the length of the rectangle is 100 m and the width is 50 m, the perimeter is:

100 + 50 = 150 m

Since there are 6 laps, the distance each player will run is:

150 / 6 = 25

Answer: 25
