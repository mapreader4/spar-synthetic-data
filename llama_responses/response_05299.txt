Let's break it down step by step.

1. Dianne has 1000 customers who buy books. 37% of them return their books, so we can find the number of customers who return their books by multiplying 1000 by 0.37. 1000 x 0.37 = 370.

2. Each of these customers return 1 book each, so the total number of books returned is 370 books.

3. Since each book costs 15 dollars, the total value of the returned books is 370 x 15 = 5550.

4. Dianne's total sales is the total amount of money she receives from the customers minus the value of the returned books. So, her total sales is 1000 x 15 - 5550. 1000 x 15 - 5550 = 4550.

Answer: 4550
