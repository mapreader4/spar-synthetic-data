Let's break this down step by step.

The dog that likes bonnies ate 60 of them.

The dog that likes blueberries eats 3/4 times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog. So, the dog that likes blueberries eats 3/4 * 60 = 45 blueberries.

The first dog, which likes apples, eats 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog that likes blueberries. So, the first dog eats 3 * 45 = 135 apples.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs:

Apples: 135
Blueberries: 45
Bonnies: 60

Total number of fruits eaten: 135 + 45 + 60 = 240

Answer: 240
