Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the total number of animals Zara has. She has 24 cows and 7 sheep. That is 24 + 7 = 31 animals.

Next, we need to find out how many groups of 48 animals she can make. We know that 48 is the number of animals in each group. To find out how many groups she can make, we can divide 31 by 48. 

31 รท 48 = 0.65 (we can't divide 31 by 48 exactly, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 0).

Since we're rounding down, that means Zara can make 0 groups of 48 animals. But we need to find out how many goats she has. We know she has 31 animals, and 31 - 24 (since she has 24 cows) = 7 sheep. So, she has 7 goats.
