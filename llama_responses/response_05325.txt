Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Ron's age now is 43. We know that in five years, Ron will be 43 + 5 = 48 years old.

If Ron will be four times as old as Maurice, then Maurice's age in five years will be 48 / 4 = 12.

So, Maurice's current age is 12 less than 5 years ago, which is 7.

So, Maurice's current age is 7.

Answer: 7
