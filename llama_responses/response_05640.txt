Let's break down the problem step by step.

Phantom's mom gave him $50 to buy printer-inks.

Two black printer inks which cost $11 each, so the total cost is 2 x $11 = $22.

Three red printer inks which cost $15 each, so the total cost is 3 x $15 = $45.

Two yellow printer inks which cost $13 each, so the total cost is 2 x $13 = $26.

The total cost of all the printer inks is $22 + $45 + $26 = $93.

Phantom only has $50, so he is short $93 - $50 = $43.
