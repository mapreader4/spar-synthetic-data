Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first calculate how many eggs are eaten every day.

Rhea's son and daughter eat 2 eggs every morning. Rhea and her husband eat 4 eggs every night. So, in total, 2 + 4 = 6 eggs are eaten every day.

In a week, there are 7 days. So, in a week, 7 x 6 = 42 eggs are eaten.

Rhea buys 2 trays of eggs. Each tray has 24 eggs. So, 2 x 24 = 48 eggs are bought.

In total, 48 - 42 = 6 eggs are not eaten every week.
