Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total number of fish from the white ducks. There are 3 white ducks, and for every white duck there are 5 fish, so the total number of fish from the white ducks is 3 x 5 = 15.

Next, let's identify the total number of fish from the black ducks. There are 7 black ducks, and for every black duck there are 10 fish, so the total number of fish from the black ducks is 7 x 10 = 70.

Finally, let's identify the total number of fish from the multicolored ducks. There are 6 multicolored ducks, and for every multicolor duck there are 12 fish, so the total number of fish from the multicolored ducks is 6 x 12 = 72.

To find the total number of fish in the lake, we need to add the number of fish from each type of duck. The total number of fish is 15 + 70 + 72 = 157.

Answer: 157
