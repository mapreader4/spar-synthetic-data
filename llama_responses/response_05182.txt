Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Kate buys 3 wands, 1 for herself and 2 for her friends.
* She pays the same price for all 3 wands, which means the cost of 1 wand is the same as the cost of 2 wands.
* She sells the wands to her friends for $5 more than she paid, which means the selling price is $5 more than the buying price.
* She collects $130 after the sale.

Let's let x be the cost of 1 wand. Then, the total cost of 3 wands would be 3x.

The cost of 1 wand is the same as the cost of 2 wands, so the cost of 2 wands is 2x.

Since Kate sells the wands for $5 more than she paid, the selling price is 5 + x.

The total cost of 3 wands is 3x, and the selling price is 5 + x, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 5 + x

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides:

3x - 5 = x

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

x = 130

So, the cost of 1 wand is 43.

Answer: 43
