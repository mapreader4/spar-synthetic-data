Let's break this down step by step.

The brownie costs $2.50, and Juanita is ordering it, so that's a total of $2.50.

She's also ordering 2 scoops of ice cream, which costs $1.00 per scoop, so that's a total of 2 x $1.00 = $2.00.

She's also ordering double syrup, which is 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

And she's also ordering nuts, which cost $1.50.

To find the total cost, we add up all these amounts:

$2.50 (brownie) + $2.00 (ice cream) + $1.00 (syrup) + $1.50 (nuts) = $6.00
