Let's break it down step by step.

John is buying two items.  The first item is the $150 pair of Nikes.  The second item is the $120 pair of work boots.  The total cost is the sum of the cost of both items.  To find the total cost, we add the cost of the Nikes to the cost of the work boots.

$150 + $120 = $270

Next, we need to add the 10% tax.

$270 x 0.10 = $27

Finally, we add the tax to the total cost.

$270 + $27 = $297

So, John paid $297.
