Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Cheryl harvests 16 cups of basil every week for 8 weeks. So, she harvests 16 * 8 = 128 cups of basil in total.

2. She needs 4 cups of basil to make 1 cup of pesto. So, to make pesto, she needs 1 cup of basil. 128 / 4 = 32 cups of basil is needed to make 32 cups of pesto.

3. To make 32 cups of pesto, she can harvest 32 cups of basil. Cheryl has 128 cups of basil. So, she can make 32 / 128 = 0.75 cups of pesto.
