Let's start by using a variable for the number of toys in the smaller pile. Let's call it x.

The larger pile is twice as big as the smaller one, so the number of toys in the larger pile is 2x.

The total number of toys is 120, which is the sum of the number of toys in the two piles. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 120

We can solve for x by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation:

x + 2x - 2x = 120 - 2x

This simplifies to:

x = 60

So, the number of toys in the smaller pile is 60. The number of toys in the larger pile is 2x, which is 2 x 60 = 120.
