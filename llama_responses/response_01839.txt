Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the weight of the elephant. The elephant weighs 3 tons, and a ton is 2000 pounds. So, the elephant's weight in pounds is 3 x 2000 = 6000 pounds.

Now, let's find the weight of the donkey. The donkey weighs 90% less than the elephant. The elephant weighs 6000 pounds, so the donkey weighs 6000 x 0.9 = 5400 pounds.

Now, let's add the weight of the elephant and the donkey. 6000 pounds + 5400 pounds = 11400 pounds.

Answer: 11400
