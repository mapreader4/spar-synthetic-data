Let's calculate the sum of their scores first. June earned a 97, Patty earned an 85, Josh earned a 100, and Henry earned a 94. So, the sum of their scores is:

97 + 85 + 100 + 94 = 376

Now, we need to find the average of these scores. To do this, we divide the sum by the number of scores:

376 / 4 = 94

So, their average math test score is 94. Since this is not higher than 89, Clyde won't buy them tickets to the concert.

Answer: 94
