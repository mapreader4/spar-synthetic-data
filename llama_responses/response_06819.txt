Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to convert the size of the program from GB to MB. Since there are 1000 MB in 1 GB, we can multiply 360 GB by 1000 to get the size in MB:

360 GB ร 1000 MB/GB = 360,000 MB

Next, we need to find out how many seconds it would take to download the program at the maximum speed of 50 MB/second:

360,000 MB รท 50 MB/second = 7,200 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, we can convert the seconds to minutes:

7,200 seconds รท 60 = 120 minutes

Finally, we need to convert the minutes to hours:

120 minutes รท 60 = 2 hours

So, Vicky would have to wait 2 hours until the program is fully downloaded at maximum speed.
