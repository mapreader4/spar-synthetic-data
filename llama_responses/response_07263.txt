Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of cans of food needed for the adult cats. Each adult cat eats 1 can of food per day, and there are 3 adult cats, so the total number of cans needed for the adult cats is 3 x 1 = 3 cans per day. Since there are 7 days, the total number of cans needed for the adult cats is 3 x 7 = 21 cans.

Next, let's find the total number of cans needed for the kittens. Each kitten eats 3/4 of a can per day, and there are 4 kittens. So, the total number of cans needed for the kittens is 4 x (3/4) = 3 cans per day. Since there are 7 days, the total number of cans needed for the kittens is 3 x 7 = 21 cans.

To find the total number of cans needed for all the animals, we add the cans needed for the adult cats and the cans needed for the kittens. 21 + 21 = 42 cans.

So, Sidney needs 42 cans of cat food to feed all of her animals for 7 days.
