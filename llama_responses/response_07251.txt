Let's break down the problem step by step.

The coupe is sold for $30,000. The SUV is sold for 2 times the price of the coupe, which is 2 * 30000 = 60,000. The commission is 2%. So, the total commission is 2% of the total amount earned, which is 0.02 * (30000 + 60000) = 1200. The answer is: Answer: 1200.
