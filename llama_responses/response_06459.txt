Let's start by using the information given to create an equation.

Juliet is 3 years older than her sister Maggie, and she is 10 years old. So, Maggie's age is 10 - 3 = 7.

Ralph is 2 years older than Juliet, so he is 10 + 2 = 12 years old.

Now, let's add the ages of Maggie and Ralph together:

Maggie's age + Ralph's age = 7 + 12 = 19.

Answer: 19
