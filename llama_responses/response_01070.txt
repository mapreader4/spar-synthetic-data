Let's break this down step by step.

Jason eats an omelet made using three eggs every morning. We can represent this as 3 eggs per day.

In two weeks, there are 14 days. So, to find out how many eggs Jason will consume in two weeks, we can multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days:

3 eggs per day x 14 days = 3 x 14 = 42

So, Jason will consume 42 eggs in two weeks.
