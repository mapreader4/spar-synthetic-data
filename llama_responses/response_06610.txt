Let's break down the problem step by step:

Mortdecai collects 8 dozen eggs every Tuesday and Thursday, which is 2 days in a week. So, he collects 8 * 2 = 16 dozen eggs in a week.

He delivers 3 dozen eggs to the market and 5 dozen eggs to the mall, which is a total of 3 + 5 = 8 dozen eggs.

So, he delivers 8 dozen eggs and uses 4 dozen eggs to make a pie. This leaves him with 16 - 8 - 4 = 4 dozen eggs.

Now, since 1 dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

So, Mortdecai donates 48 eggs to the charity.

Answer: 48
