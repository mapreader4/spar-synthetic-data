Let's break down the situation step by step:

Initially, there were some cookies in the jar. Lou Senior took 3 cookies out and ate them, so there are now some cookies left minus 3.

The next day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies out, but put 2 of them back, so there are now some cookies left minus 1 (the one he ate).

Then, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out and hid them, so there are now some cookies left minus 7.

Debra, Lou's wife, accused him of eating half of the cookies in the jar. This means that the number of cookies left is half of the original number of cookies.

Let's call the original number of cookies x. Since Debra accused Lou of eating half of the cookies, this means that the number of cookies left is x/2.

We know that the number of cookies left is x/2, and we also know that the number of cookies left is some cookies left minus 7 (because Louie Junior took 7 cookies). So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = some cookies left - 7

We also know that some cookies left is the original number of cookies minus 1 (because Lou Senior ate one cookie) minus 7 (because Louie Junior took 7 cookies). So, we can write:

some cookies left = x - 1 - 7

Substituting this expression into the equation above, we get:

x/2 = x - 1 - 7

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x/2 = x - 8

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

-x/2 = -8

Multiplying both sides by -2 gives:

x = 16

So, the original number of cookies was 16.

Answer: 8
