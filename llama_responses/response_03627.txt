Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Since Jeffrey takes two steps backwards for every 3 steps forward, and the distance between the house and the mailbox is 66 steps, we can find the number of times he takes 3 steps forward by dividing the total distance by 3. So, the number of times he takes 3 steps forward is 66 รท 3 = 22.

Step 2: Now, for each of these 22 times he takes 3 steps forward, he takes 2 steps backwards. So, the total number of steps he takes is 22 x 2 = 44.

Answer: 44
