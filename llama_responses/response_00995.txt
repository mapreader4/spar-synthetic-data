Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's start by letting "x" be Josh's age when he got married. When they're celebrating 30 years of marriage, Josh is 52 (52 = 22 + 30). So, Josh's age when he got married is 22.

2. Since their combined age is 5 times Josh's age when he got married, Anna's age is 5 * 22 = 110. But we know that Josh and Anna were born on August 17th, so we know that Josh and Anna's ages are the same. So, Anna's age when they got married is 110 - 22 = 88.

Answer: 88
