Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the cost of one piece of the Uno Giant Family Card. We know that the cost of one piece is $12.

Next, we need to find the total cost of 10 pieces. To do this, we can multiply the cost of one piece by 10.

12 x 10 = 120

So, the total cost of 10 pieces would be 120.

Now, Ivan was given a discount of 2 dollars for each piece. To find the discounted price, we need to subtract 2 from the total cost.

120 - 2 = 118

So, Ivan paid a total of 118 dollars.
