Let's start by identifying the total amount each person needs to contribute towards the vacation. Since there are 5 people in the family and the vacation costs $1,000, each person needs to contribute $200.

Since Jules charges $2 to start a walk and $1.25 per block, the total amount he needs to make is $200 x 5 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how many blocks he needs to walk to make that amount. We can do this by subtracting the starting fee from the total amount:

$1000 - $2 = $998

Now, we need to find how many blocks he needs to walk to make $998. Since he earns $1.25 per block, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount he earns per block:

$998 รท $1.25 = 798

So, Jules needs to walk 798 blocks in total to make the $1,000 for his family's vacation.

Answer: 798
