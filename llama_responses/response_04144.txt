Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the cost of the bread: 3$ for the loaf of bread.

Next, we have the cost of the candy bar: 2$.

And lastly, we have the cost of the turkey: 1/3 of 32$, which is 32/3 = 10.33$.

Now, let's add up the costs:

3$ + 2$ + 10.33$ = 15.33$

So, we have 32$ - 15.33$ left.
