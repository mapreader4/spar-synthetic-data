Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of pounds of food the bear eats per day. We know the bear eats up to 90 pounds of food per day.

Now, we need to find the total number of pounds of food the bear would eat in 3 weeks. To do this, we need to multiply the number of pounds of food eaten per day by the number of days.

So, we have:

* 90 pounds per day
* 3 weeks

To find the total number of pounds of food, we multiply:

90 pounds per day * 3 weeks = 90 * 3 = 270 pounds

So, the bear would eat 270 pounds of food in 3 weeks.

Answer: 270
