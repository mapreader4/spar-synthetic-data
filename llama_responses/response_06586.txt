Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the first number is x.

The second number is twice the first number, so it is 2x.

The sum of the two numbers is 33, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

We can subtract x from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 33 - 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1:

x = (33 - 2x) / 1

x = 33 - 2x

x = 33 / 2

x = 16.5

So, the second number is 16.5.
