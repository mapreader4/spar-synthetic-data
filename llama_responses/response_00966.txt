Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Ryan's party had x people. Since his party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, that means Taylor's party had x/4 people. So, the total number of people at both parties combined is x + (x/4). We know that the total number of people at both parties combined is 240. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

x + (x/4) = 240

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x + (x/4) = 240 * 4 = 240*4

This simplifies to:

4x = 960

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 240

So, there were 240 people at Ryan's party.
