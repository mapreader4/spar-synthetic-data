To solve this problem, I will break it down step by step.

Step 1: Convert the time period from months to weeks: 4 months is equal to 16 weeks.

Step 2: The tree grows at a rate of 2 feet per week. So, in 16 weeks, the tree will grow 2 x 16 = 32 feet.

Step 3: The tree is currently 10 feet tall. So, after 16 weeks, the tree will be 10 + 32 = 42 feet tall.

Answer: 42
