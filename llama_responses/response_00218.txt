Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start with the information that Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels. This means that the number of nickels Ravi has is 2 more than the number of quarters. Since Ravi has 6 nickels, we can write an equation to represent this information:

6 = (number of nickels) + 2

This equation can be simplified to:

6 = (number of nickels) - 2

To solve for the number of nickels, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(number of nickels) = 6 - 2
(number of nickels) = 4

So, Ravi has 4 nickels.

Now, let's look at the information that Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters. This means that the number of dimes Ravi has is 4 more than the number of quarters. Since we know that Ravi has 4 nickels, which is the same as 8 quarters, we can write an equation to represent this information:

(number of dimes) = (number of quarters) + 4

We can substitute the known value of quarters for quarters into the equation:

(number of dimes) = 8 + 4
(number of dimes) = 12

So, Ravi has 12 dimes.

Now, to find the total amount of money Ravi has, we can add the number of nickels and the number of dimes:

Total money = number of nickels + number of dimes
Total money = 4 + 12
Total money = 16

Answer: 16
