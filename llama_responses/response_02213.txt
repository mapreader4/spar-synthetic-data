Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Nancy agreed to pay 40% of the cost of her daughter's car insurance. This means that Nancy will pay 40% of the cost each year.

The cost of the car insurance is given as $80 per month. So, to find out how much Nancy will pay each year, we can multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost. $80 * 12 = $960.

Then, we need to multiply this by 40% to find out how much Nancy will pay each year. 40% of $960 is 0.4 * 960 = $384.

So, Nancy will pay $384 each year.
