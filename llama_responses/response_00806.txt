Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the discount on the vase.

The vase went on sale for 25% off, so the new price is 75% of the original price.

The original price was $200. 75% of $200 is $150.

Next, we need to find the amount of sales tax Donna paid.

The sales tax is 10% of the new price. 10% of $150 is $15.

To find the total amount Donna paid, we add the price of the vase and the sales tax together.

The price of the vase is $150, and the sales tax is $15. The total amount Donna paid is $165.

Answer: 165
