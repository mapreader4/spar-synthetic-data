Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Betty has x blue beads. Since Betty has 3 red beads for every 2 blue beads, that means for every 2 blue beads, she has 3 red beads. So, for every 2 blue beads, we can say that Betty has 3 red beads.

Let's find out how many blue beads Betty has. Since she has 30 red beads, we can divide 30 by 2 to find the number of times she has 2 blue beads. 30 divided by 2 is 15. Since Betty has 3 red beads for every 2 blue beads, we can multiply 15 by 3 to find the number of blue beads she has. 15 times 3 is 45. So, Betty has 45 blue beads.

Answer: 45
