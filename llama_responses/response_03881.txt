Let's start by calculating the price per ounce for the larger box. To do this, we need to divide the cost of the box by the number of ounces it contains.

Cost of larger box: $4.80
Number of ounces in larger box: 30

Price per ounce in larger box: $4.80 รท 30 = $0.16 per ounce

Now, let's calculate the price per ounce for the smaller box.

Cost of smaller box: $3.40
Number of ounces in smaller box: 20

Price per ounce in smaller box: $3.40 รท 20 = $0.17 per ounce

Now, we can compare the two prices per ounce. Since $0.16 is less than $0.17, the larger box is the better value.
