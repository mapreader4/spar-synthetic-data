Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with Sean. We know Sean has 4 dollars more than half as much money as Fritz. So, if Fritz has 40 dollars, then Sean has 40 / 2 = 20 dollars. Since Sean has 4 dollars more than that, Sean has 20 + 4 = 24 dollars.

Now, let's look at Rick. Rick has 3 times as much money as Sean. So, if Sean has 24 dollars, Rick has 3 x 24 = 72 dollars.

Now, let's add the amount of money Rick and Sean have. Rick has 72 dollars and Sean has 24 dollars. So, Rick and Sean together have 72 + 24 = 96 dollars.

Answer: 96
