Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with Cat Cafe Meow. It has 3 times as many cats as Cat Cafe Paw. Let's find out how many cats Cat Cafe Paw has. We know Cat Cafe Paw has 2 times as many cats as Cat Cafe Cool. We know Cat Cafe Cool has 5 cats. So, Cat Cafe Paw has 2 * 5 = 10 cats.

So, Cat Cafe Paw has 10 cats. Now, we can multiply this with the 3 that Cat Cafe Meow has as many cats. So, Cat Cafe Meow has 3 * 10 = 30 cats.

Therefore, in total, there are 30 cats in Cat Cafe Meow and Cat Cafe Paw.
