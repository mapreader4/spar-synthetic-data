Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by adding the grades she already has: 95% + 80% = 175%.

To get an average grade of 90%, she would need to get a total of 270 points out of 300. Since she has already gotten 175 points, she would need to get 270 - 175 = 95 more points on the third test.

So, she would need to get a 95 on the third test.
