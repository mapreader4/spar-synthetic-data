Let's break it down step by step.

Iris bought 3 jackets at $10 each, so she spent 3 x $10 = $30 on jackets.

She bought 2 pairs of shorts at $6 each, so she spent 2 x $6 = $12 on shorts.

She bought 4 pairs of pants at $12 each, so she spent 4 x $12 = $48 on pants.

To find the total amount she spent, we add up the cost of the jackets, shorts, and pants: $30 + $12 + $48 = $90.

Answer: 90
