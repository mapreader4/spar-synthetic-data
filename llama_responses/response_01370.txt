Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Hannah's son can cut 3 strands per minute.
* Hannah can cut 8 strands per minute.

To find the total number of strands that Hannah's son can cut in one minute, we multiply the number of strands per minute by the number of minutes:

3 strands per minute x 1 minute = 3

So, Hannah's son can cut 3 strands in one minute.

Now, Hannah's son is stuck to a chair with 22 strands of duct tape. We need to find the number of minutes it will take them to free him.

Let's divide the total number of strands by the number of strands that Hannah's son can cut in one minute:

22 strands รท 3 strands per minute = 22 รท 3 = 7.33

So, it will take them approximately 7.33 minutes to free her younger son.
