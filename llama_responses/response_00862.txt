To find out how many more acorns each squirrel needs to collect, we can subtract the number of acorns each squirrel needs from the total number of acorns collected by the squirrels.

Let's do that:

5 squirrels * 130 acorns / 1 squirrel = 650 acorns

Subtract 575 acorns from 650 acorns to find the number of acorns each squirrel needs to collect more:

650 - 575 = 75

Answer: 75
