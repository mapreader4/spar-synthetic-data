Let's break this down step by step.

Phoebe has two pizzas, one with pepperoni and one with cheese. Each pizza has 16 slices. Since they all eat the same amount, that means each pizza has 16 slices / 4 = 4 slices per person.

One friend eats only pepperoni, so they eat 4 slices of pepperoni. The remaining 12 slices (16 - 4 = 12) are shared among the other two friends. Since there are 2 friends, they will each eat 12 / 2 = 6 slices of cheese.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 4
