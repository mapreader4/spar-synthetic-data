Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the initial total lifting capacity:

Clean and jerk: 80 kg
Snatch: 50 kg
Total: 80 + 50 = 130 kg

Now, let's find the new clean and jerk capacity after doubling it:

New clean and jerk: 80 kg * 2 = 160 kg
New snatch: 50 kg * (1 + 0.8) = 50 kg * 1.8 = 90 kg
New total: 160 + 90 = 250 kg

So, John's new combined total lifting capacity is:

Answer: 250
