Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first pair of dumbbells are 3 lb weights, so that's 3 lb.
2. The second pair is 5 lb weights, so that's 5 lb.
3. The third pair is 8 lb pounds, so that's 8 lb.

To find the total weight of the entire system, we add the weights together:

3 lb + 5 lb + 8 lb = 16 lb

Answer: 16
