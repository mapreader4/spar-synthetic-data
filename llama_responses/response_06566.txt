Let's break this problem down step by step.

Thomas originally orders 3 dozen chairs, which is equal to 3 x 12 = 36 chairs.

Then, he finds out that 1/3 of the guests want to bring a guest of their own. This means that 1/3 of 36 guests want to bring a guest, so Thomas needs to order chairs for 12 additional guests (36 x 1/3 = 12).

Since each of these 12 guests will bring one guest, Thomas needs to order chairs for 12 more guests, making the total number of guests 36 + 12 = 48.

However, Thomas finds out that 5 of the original guests can't make it. So, he needs to subtract 5 from the total number of guests: 48 - 5 = 43.

Finally, Thomas wants to order 12 extra chairs just in case they need them.

To find the total number of chairs Thomas needs to order, we add the original 36 chairs, the additional 12 chairs for the guests who brought a guest, and the 12 extra chairs: 36 + 12 + 12 = 60.

Answer: 60
