Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first calculate the total cost of the machine. The cost of the parts is $3600 and the cost of the patent is $4500. So, the total cost is $3600 + $4500 = $8100.

Now, let's calculate the profit. The machine sells for $180. So, the profit per machine is $180.

To break even, Darryl needs to sell the machine to recover the total cost. So, the number of machines he needs to sell is:

$8100 (total cost) / $180 (profit per machine) = 45 machines.

Answer: 45
