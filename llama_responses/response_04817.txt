Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of this year's costume. Since the costume is 40% more expensive than last year's costume, which was $250, we can multiply 250 by 1.4 (which is 100% + 40%) to get the cost of this year's costume. This gives us:

250 x 1.4 = 350

So this year's costume costs $350.

Jeff has to put in a 10% deposit, which is 10% of the cost of the costume. To find 10% of the cost, we can multiply the cost by 0.1:

350 x 0.1 = 35

So the deposit is $35.

When Jeff picks up the costume, he will have to pay the deposit and the remaining amount. The remaining amount is the cost of the costume minus the deposit:

350 - 35 = 315

So Jeff will pay $315 when he picks up the costume.
