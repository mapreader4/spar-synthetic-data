Let's break down the total amount John spent into the cost of the racket and the cost of the sneakers and sports outfit.

Let's say the cost of the racket is x.

The total cost is $750, which is the sum of the cost of the racket and the cost of the sneakers and sports outfit.

We can set up the equation as follows:

x + 200 + 250 = 750

Subtract 250 from both sides to get:

x + 200 = 500

Subtract 200 from both sides to get:

x = 300

Answer: 300
