Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of junk items. We know that 70% of the items are junk, and we know that 20% are useful, so we can subtract 20% from 100% to find the number of junk items. 100% - 20% = 80%. 80% of the items are junk, and 80% of 8 items is equal to 6.4. So, the number of junk items is 6.4.
