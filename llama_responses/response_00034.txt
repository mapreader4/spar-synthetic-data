Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Ken got $x. Since Tony got twice as much as Ken, Tony got 2x.

The total amount of money shared was 1750. The total amount of money shared is the sum of the money given to Ken and Tony.

So, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

x + 2x = 1750

We can add x to both sides of the equation to get:

x + 3x = 1750

Now, we can subtract x from both sides to get:

2x = 875

So, the money given to Tony is 2x = 1750 - x = 875.
