Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Let's find the number of cookies with nuts. Sally says 1/4 of her cookies have nuts in them. 1/4 of 60 cookies is 15 cookies. So, Maria needs nuts for 15 cookies.

2. Then, let's find the number of cookies with chocolate chips. Sally says 40% of her cookies have chocolate chips in them. 40% of 60 cookies is 24 cookies. So, Maria needs chocolate chips for 24 cookies.

3. The remainder of the cookies are the ones with both nuts and chocolate chips. The total number of cookies is 60, and 15 + 24 = 39 cookies are already accounted for. So, the remainder is 60 - 39 = 21 cookies.

4. Since each cookie with nuts and chocolate chips has 2 nuts, Maria needs 2 * 21 = 42 nuts for the remainder cookies.

Answer: 42
