Let's break this problem down step by step.

Austin has 10 pairs of shoes, which is equal to 20 individual shoes. He has polished 45% of the shoes. 45% of 20 is equal to 9 shoes. So, he has polished 9 shoes.

To find out how many shoes he needs to polish, we subtract the number of shoes he has polished from the total number of shoes he has. 20 - 9 = 11. So, Austin needs to polish 11 more shoes.
