Let's break this down step by step.

Let's calculate the number of balloons Mary can inflate in 30 minutes:

Mary inflates 10 balloons per minute. So in 30 minutes, she can inflate 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.

Jess inflates 7 balloons per minute. So in 30 minutes, she can inflate 7 * 30 = 210 balloons.

Christina is late and inflates 4 balloons per minute. Since she has 15 minutes, she can inflate 4 * 15 = 60 balloons.

Now, let's add the number of balloons each person can inflate:

Mary: 300 balloons
Jess: 210 balloons
Christina: 60 balloons

Total number of balloons = 300 + 210 + 60 = 570

Answer: 570
