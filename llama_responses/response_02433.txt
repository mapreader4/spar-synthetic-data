Let's break it down step by step.

Josh starts with 100 feet of rope.

1. He cuts the rope in half, so he now has 50 feet of rope.

2. He takes one of the halves and cuts it in half again, so he now has 2 pieces, each with 25 feet of rope.

3. He grabs one of the remaining pieces and cuts it into fifths, so he now has 5 pieces, each with 5 feet of rope.
