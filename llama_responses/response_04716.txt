Let's count the number of wheels:

Bicycles: 3 bicycles, each with 2 wheels, so 3 x 2 = 6 wheels.
Tricycles: 4 tricycles, each with 3 wheels, so 4 x 3 = 12 wheels.
Unicycles: 7 unicycles, each with 1 wheel, so 7 x 1 = 7 wheels.

Adding up the number of wheels: 6 + 12 + 7 = 25 wheels.

Answer: 25
