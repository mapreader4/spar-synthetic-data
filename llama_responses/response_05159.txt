Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the number of students in the class is x.

The number of hands in the class is 2x, since each student has 2 hands.

We are given that there are 20 hands in the class, not including Peter. So, we can set up the equation:

20 = 2x

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

So, there are 10 students in the class, including Peter.

Answer: 11
