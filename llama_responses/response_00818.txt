Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's count the total number of tasks Trey has to do. He has 7 things to do to clean the house, 1 thing to do to take a shower, and 4 things to do to make dinner. So, the total number of tasks is:

7 + 1 + 4 = 12

Now, since everything takes 10 minutes to do, we need to multiply the total number of tasks by 10 to find the total time it will take to complete the tasks.

12 tasks * 10 minutes per task = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 minutes รท 60 = 2 hours
