Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start with the trumpets, which are 6 in total. Each trumpet and clarinet player carries 5 pounds of weight. So, the total weight of the trumpets and clarinets is 6 x 5 = 30 pounds.

Next, we have the trombones. There are 8 trombones, each carrying 10 pounds of weight. So, the total weight of the trombones is 8 x 10 = 80 pounds.

Now, let's move on to the tubas. There are 3 tubas, each carrying 20 pounds of weight. So, the total weight of the tubas is 3 x 20 = 60 pounds.

Finally, we have the drummers. There are 2 drummers, each carrying 15 pounds of weight. So, the total weight of the drummers is 2 x 15 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of the trumpets, clarinets, trombones, tubas, and drummers:

30 pounds (trumpets and clarinets) + 80 pounds (trombones) + 60 pounds (tubas) + 30 pounds (drummers) = 200 pounds.

Answer: 200
