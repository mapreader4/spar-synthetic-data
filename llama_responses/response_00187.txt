Let's start by using the information given that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. We can write that as an equation:

5/8 * 2 = 10

This means that 10 crayons were not yet used.

The 2 other boxes have a total of 24 - 10 = 14 crayons used. The last box has some crayons left over, and the fraction of crayons used is 2/3. So, we can find the number of crayons left by multiplying the total used crayons by 3/2:

14 * 3/2 = 21

So, the number of crayons left is 21.

Answer: 21
