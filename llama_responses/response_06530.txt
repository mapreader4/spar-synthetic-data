Let's break this down step by step.

Charles has 20 papers initially. He drew 6 pictures today, leaving him with 20 - 6 = 14 papers. Yesterday, he drew 6 pictures, leaving him with 14 - 6 = 8 papers.

When he came back from work, he drew some more pictures, so let's say he drew x pictures. We know that he has 2 papers left, so 14 - x = 2.

So, we can set up the equation: 14 - x = 2. To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation: x = 14 - 2.

x = 12.

Answer: 12
