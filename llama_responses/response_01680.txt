Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that there were 349 pieces of candy initially in the bowl.

Talitha took 108 pieces, so we subtract 108 from the total amount to get the remaining amount:

349 - 108 = 241

Then Solomon took 153 pieces, so we subtract 153 from the remaining amount:

241 - 153 = 88

So, the number of pieces of candy remaining in the bowl is 88.
