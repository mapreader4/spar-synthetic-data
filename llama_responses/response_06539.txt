Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, the total number of cars produced is 5,650,000. Then, the first supplier receives 1,000,000 cars. So, the remaining cars are:

5,650,000 - 1,000,000 = 4,650,000

The second supplier receives 500,000 more cars than the first supplier, so it receives:

1,000,000 + 500,000 = 1,500,000

The third supplier receives the same number as the first and second suppliers combined, which is:

1,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,500,000

Now, the remaining cars are:

4,650,000 - 2,500,000 = 2,150,000

The fourth and fifth suppliers receive an equal number of cars, so we can divide the remaining cars by 2:

2,150,000 / 2 = 1,075,000

So, the fourth and fifth suppliers each receive 1,075,000 cars.

Answer: 1,075,000
