To find the total cost of the bracelets, we can multiply the cost of materials by the number of bracelets made, which is 52. 52 * 3.00 = 156.00.  After giving away 8 bracelets, she has 52 - 8 = 44 bracelets left. 44 bracelets at 0.25 each is 11.00.  To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the bracelets from the revenue, we get 11.00 - 15.60 = 5.40.  The answer is: Answer: 5.40.
