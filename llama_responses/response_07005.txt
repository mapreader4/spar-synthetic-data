Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Find the surface area of the Earth. The surface area of the Earth is 510 million square kilometers.

Step 2: The moon has a surface area that is 1/5 that of the Earth. So, the surface area of the moon is 102 million square kilometers.

Step 3: The land on the moon is worth 6 times that of the land on the Earth. So, the value of the land on the moon is 6 x 80 billion dollars, which is 480 billion dollars.

Answer: 480 billion.
