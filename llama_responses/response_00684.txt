To find the time it would take to read a 250-page book, we can set up a proportion. We know that the time it takes to read a 200-page book is 20 hours. So the time it takes to read a 250-page book is proportional to the number of pages. We can set up the proportion:

Let the number of pages be x. We know that the time it takes to read 200 pages is 20 hours, so the time it takes to read 250 pages is 250/200 x 20 = 25 hours.

Answer: 25
