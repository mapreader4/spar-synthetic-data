Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by determining how many wipes Randy needs.

Randy walks his dog twice a day, so that's 2 times 120 wipes per day. 2 x 120 = 240 wipes per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days Randy wants to walk his dog. He wants to walk his dog for 360 days.

So, we multiply the wipes needed per day by the number of days. 240 wipes per day x 360 days = 86400 wipes.

So, Randy will need 864 packs of wipes to have enough wipes for 360 days.
