Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Brinley counted 100 snakes, 80 arctic foxes, and 20 leopards. Let's add these numbers together to get the total number of animals: 100 + 80 + 20 = 200.

Next, we know that there are ten times more bee-eaters than leopards. So, if there are 20 leopards, then there are 20 x 10 = 200 bee-eaters. Adding this to the total, we get 200 + 200 = 400.

Then, we know that there are half as many cheetahs as snakes. Since there are 100 snakes, half of that is 100 / 2 = 50 cheetahs.

Finally, we know that there are twice as many alligators as the total number of Arctic foxes and leopards. The total number of Arctic foxes and leopards is 80 + 20 = 100. Twice that is 100 x 2 = 200 alligators.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals: 200 + 400 + 50 + 200 = 850.

Answer: 850
