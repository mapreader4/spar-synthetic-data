Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by letting x be Jessica's current age. We know that Jessica is 6 years older than Claire. So, Claire's age can be represented as x - 6.

We also know that in 2 years, Claire will be 20 years old. So, we can set up an equation to represent Claire's age in 2 years: x + 2 = 20.

We can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get x = 18.

So, Jessica is 18 years old.
