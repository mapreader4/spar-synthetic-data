Let's start by calculating how much Jeremy spent on the jerseys. 5 jerseys at $2 each will cost 5 x 2 = 10 dollars. Then, the basketball cost 18 dollars, and the shorts cost 8 dollars. So, the total amount spent on equipment is 10 + 18 + 8 = 36 dollars. Jeremy's initial 50 dollars minus the 36 dollars spent is 50 - 36 = 14 dollars. Answer: 14.
