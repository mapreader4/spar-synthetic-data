Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of apples and pears.

Let's say the number of apples is x. Since there are two more pears than apples, the number of pears is x + 2.

The total number of fruit is 19. So, the number of bananas is 19 - (x + 2) - x = 19 - x.

Since there are three more bananas than pears, the number of bananas is x + 3.

We can write an equation to solve for x: x + 2 + x + 3 = 19.

Subtract x + 2 from both sides of the equation to get: x + 3 = 19 - 2 = 17.

So, the number of bananas is 17.

Answer: 17
