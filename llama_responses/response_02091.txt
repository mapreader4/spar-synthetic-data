Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. First, let's identify the original price of the shoes: $184.
2. The store has an 8% discount. To find the discount, we can multiply the original price by 0.08: $184 * 0.08 = $14.72.
3. To find the amount Shara saved, we subtract the discount from the original price: $184 - $14.72 = $169.28.

Answer: $169.28.
