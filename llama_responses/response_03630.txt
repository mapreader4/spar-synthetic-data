Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of doors needed for all the apartments. Each apartment has 7 doors, and there are 6 apartments per floor, and there are 12 floors. So, the total number of doors needed is:

6 doors * 12 floors = 72 doors

So, the construction company needs to buy 72 doors.
