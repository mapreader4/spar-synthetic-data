Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Sam has $75. Billy has $25 less than twice that amount. So, Billy has 2 x $25 = $50. 

To find out how much money they have together, we need to add the money they have. Sam has $75 and Billy has $50, so together they have $75 + $50 = $125.

Answer: 125
