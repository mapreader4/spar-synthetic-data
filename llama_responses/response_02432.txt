Let's break it down step by step:

Annie brought 20 brownies to school.

She gave half of them to the school administrator, which is 20 / 2 = 10.

She has 20 - 10 = 10 brownies left.

She gave half of the remaining brownies to her best friend, Carl, which is 10 / 2 = 5.

She has 10 - 5 = 5 brownies left.

She gave another 2 brownies to her friend, Simon.

She has 5 - 2 = 3 brownies left.
