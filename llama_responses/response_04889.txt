Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of chickens. We know that 1/3 of the birds are ducks, so to find the number of chickens, we subtract the number of ducks from the total number of birds.

1/3 of 15 birds are ducks. So, we multiply 1/3 x 15 = 5. So, the number of ducks is 5. Then, we subtract 5 from 15 to get the number of chickens.

The number of chickens is 15 - 5 = 10.

Now, the cost to feed the chickens is 2 dollars per bird. So, the total cost is 2 x 10 = 20.

Answer: 20
