Let's break this down step by step.

Nina has 10 dollars a week as an allowance, and she wants to save half of that. So, she can save 10 / 2 = 5 dollars a week. She needs 50 dollars to buy the game, and there is a 10 percent sales tax. The total cost of the game is 50 + 50 * 0.1 = 55 dollars.

To find out how many weeks it will take her to save up the money, we need to divide the total cost by her weekly savings. 55 / 5 = 11 weeks.
