Let's break this problem down step by step.

Hans is currently 8 years old. Annika will be three times as old as Hans. So, we can set up an equation.

Let x be Annika's current age. We know that 3x = 8, where x is Hans' current age.

So, we can solve for x.

x = 8 / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67 (not 2.67, because we're looking for an integer).

So, Annika is 2 years old now.
