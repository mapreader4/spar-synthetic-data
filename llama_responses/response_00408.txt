Let the total weight of the 3 adults be 3x140 = 420 pounds. The total weight of the 2 children is 2x64 = 128 pounds. The total weight of all the people already in the elevator is 420 + 128 = 548 pounds. The maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator should be 600 - 548 = 52 pounds. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: 52.
