Let's break it down step by step:

1. Kiki made 10 cucumber sandwiches, which were cut into 4 triangles each, so that's 10 x 4 = 40 triangles.
2. Kiki made 8 egg sandwiches, which were cut into 2 rectangles each, so that's 8 x 2 = 16 rectangles.
3. The guests ate 28 triangles, which is the total number of cucumber triangles.
4. The guests also ate 12 rectangles, which is the total number of egg rectangles.
5. To find the total number of slices of bread, we need to add the number of triangles and rectangles eaten. So, 40 (triangles) + 16 (rectangles) = 56.

Answer: 56
