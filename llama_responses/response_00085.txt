Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. We know that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, so Jolyn's age is 2 months more than Therese's age.
2. We know that Therese is 5 months older than Aivo, so Therese's age is 5 months more than Aivo's age.
3. We know that Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, so Leon's age is 2 months more than Aivo's age.

Now, let's find Jolyn's age by adding the differences:

Jolyn's age = Therese's age + 2 months
Therese's age = Aivo's age + 5 months
Therese's age = Aivo's age + 5 months
Jolyn's age = (Aivo's age + 5 months) + 2 months

Jolyn's age = Aivo's age + 7 months

So, Jolyn is 7 months older than Aivo.
