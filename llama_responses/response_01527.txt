Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of balloons the clown has initially.

The clown has 3 balloons on a string in his hand.

Then, 3 boys and 12 girls buy a balloon each.

This means that the clown starts with 3 balloons.

After 3 boys and 12 girls buy a balloon each, the clown gives out 3 balloons to the boys and 12 balloons to the girls.

So, the clown has 3 balloons left.
