Let's break it down step by step:

Let's say the original price of the shoes is x.

The shoes are 75% off, so we can set up an equation to represent the discount.

The equation would be:

x - 0.75x = 51

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 100 to get:

x = 51 * 100 / 0.75

x = 68

So, the original price of the shoes is $68.

Answer: 68
