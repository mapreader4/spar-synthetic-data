Let's start by finding the area of the box.

The area of the box is the product of its height, width, and length. The area of the box is 8 inches * 10 inches * 12 inches = 96 square inches.

Next, we need to find the area of the building block. The area of the block is 3 inches * 2 inches * 4 inches = 24 square inches.

Now, let's divide the area of the box by the area of the block. To do this, we divide 96 square inches by 24 square inches. This gives us the number of blocks that can fit into the box.

96 square inches รท 24 square inches = 4 blocks.
