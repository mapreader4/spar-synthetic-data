Let's break this down step by step.

Let's first find the cost of the basic calculator. The basic calculator costs $8.

Next, the scientific calculator costs twice the price of the basic calculator. So, the cost of the scientific calculator is 2 x 8 = 16.

The graphing calculator costs thrice the price of the scientific calculator. So, the cost of the graphing calculator is 3 x 16 = 48.

The total cost of the three calculators is the sum of the cost of the basic, scientific, and graphing calculators. So, the total cost is 8 + 16 + 48 = 72.

The math teacher has $100. So, the change she received is 100 - 72 = 28.

Answer: 28
