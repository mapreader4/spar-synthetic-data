Let's start by identifying how many pairs of shoes each person has. Scott has 7 pairs of shoes.  Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott, so Anthony has 7 * 3 = 21 pairs of shoes.  Jim has 2 less pairs of shoes than Anthony, so Jim has 21 - 2 = 19 pairs of shoes.

To find the difference in the number of pairs of shoes that Anthony has compared to Jim, we can subtract 19 from 21: 21 - 19 = 2.  Therefore, Anthony has 2 more pairs of shoes than Jim.
