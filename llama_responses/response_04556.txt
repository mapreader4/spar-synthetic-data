To find out how many hours each student in the 5th grade needs to read per day, we can first find the total number of hours the 5th grade has to read in total. The 6th grade read 299 hours in total, so the 5th grade needs to read 299 - 6 * 7 = 299 - 42 hours to beat them. To find the average number of hours per day, we divide 257 hours by 7 days, which is 36.75 hours per day. So the answer is: Answer: 36.75
