Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the number of cars that pass on each day:

Monday: 20% less than 25, so 25 - (20% of 25) = 25 - 5 = 20
Tuesday: 25
Wednesday: 2 more cars than Monday, so 20 + 2 = 22
Thursday: 10
Friday: 10
Saturday and Sunday: 5 each

Now, let's add up the number of cars for each day:

20 + 25 + 22 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 92

Answer: 92
