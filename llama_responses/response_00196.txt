Let's break it down step by step:

Kris is 24 years old now.

Herbert is 10 years younger than Kris.

To find out how old Herbert will be next year, we need to add 1 year to his age.

Herbert's age = Kris's age - 10 = 24 - 10 = 14.

So, next year, Herbert will be 14 + 1 = 15 years old.

Answer: 15
