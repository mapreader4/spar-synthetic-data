Let's break it down step by step.

Let's first find out how many balls of wool Aaron uses.

Aaron makes 10 scarves, and each scarf uses 3 balls of wool. So, Aaron uses 10 x 3 = 30 balls of wool for the scarves.

Aaron also makes 5 sweaters, and each sweater uses 4 balls of wool. So, Aaron uses 5 x 4 = 20 balls of wool for the sweaters.

Now, let's find out how many balls of wool Enid uses.

Enid makes 8 sweaters, and each sweater uses 4 balls of wool. So, Enid uses 8 x 4 = 32 balls of wool for the sweaters.

Now, let's find the total number of balls of wool Aaron and Enid use.

Aaron uses 30 + 20 = 50 balls of wool for the scarves and sweaters. So, the total number of balls of wool Aaron and Enid use is 50.
