Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the total number of 1/4 cup scoops needed to equal 6 cups. Since 1 cup is equal to 4 x 1/4 cups, we can set up a multiplication problem to find the number of scoops needed:

6 cups = 6 x?

Since 4 x 1/4 = 1, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to get:

6 x? = 6 x 6

To solve for the unknown, we can divide both sides by 6:

? = 6

So, the answer is that Michael needs 6 scoops of 1/4 cup to get 6 cups of flour.
