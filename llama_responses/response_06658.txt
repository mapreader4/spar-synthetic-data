Let's break this down step by step.

On Tuesday, Anna ate 4 apples.

On Wednesday, Anna ate double the apples she ate on Tuesday, so she ate 4 * 2 = 8 apples.

On Thursday, Anna ate half the apples she ate on Tuesday, so she ate 4 / 2 = 2 apples.

To find the total number of apples Anna has eaten, we add the apples she ate on Tuesday, the apples she ate on Wednesday, and the apples she ate on Thursday:

4 + 8 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is: Answer: 14
