Let's start by finding the total number of slices. Each cake has 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 2 x 8 = 16. A fourth of the slices are given away to his friends, which is 16 / 4 = 4 slices. A third of the remaining slices are given away to his family, which is 16 - 4 = 12 slices. Alex eats 3 slices, so we subtract 3 from the remaining 12 slices, which leaves us with 12 - 3 = 9 slices.
