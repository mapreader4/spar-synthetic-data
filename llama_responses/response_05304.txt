Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the total amount of water Gumball drank on the days with recorded data: 9 liters on Monday, Thursday and Saturday, and 8 liters on Tuesday and Sunday. This gives us a total of 9 + 9 + 8 = 26 liters of water.

We know that Gumball drank a total of 60 liters of water in the week. To find out how much he drank on Wednesday, we need to subtract the amount he drank on the other days from the total amount.

Let's subtract 26 liters from 60 liters: 60 - 26 = 34.

So, Gumball drank 34 liters of water on Wednesday.
