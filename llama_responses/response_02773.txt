Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information we know:

1. Justin is 26 years old.
2. When Justin was born, his elder sister Jessica was 6 years old.
3. James is their elder brother and is 7 years older than Jessica.

We can conclude that James is 6 + 7 = 13 years old when Justin was born.
Since Justin is 26 years old, we know that 13 + 26 = 39 years have passed since James was born.

To find the age of James after 5 years, we add 5 to 39:

39 + 5 = 44

Answer: 44
