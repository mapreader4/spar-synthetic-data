Let's break this down step by step.

The regular price of a mani/pedi is $40.00. Since they are offering 25% off the regular rate, we need to find 25% of the original price.

To find 25% of $40.00, I will multiply $40.00 by 0.25.

$40.00 x 0.25 = $10.00

So, the discount is $10.00.

Now, to find the new price, I will subtract the discount from the original price.

$40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00

Charlotte is treating herself, her daughter, and 3 granddaughters to a total of 4 mani/pedis. To find the total cost, I will multiply the discounted price by 4.

$30.00 x 4 = $120.00

Answer: 120
