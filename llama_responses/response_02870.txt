Let's break this problem down step by step.

Hanna has 300 roses. Jenna will receive 1/3 of the roses, so Jenna will receive 300 * 1/3 = 100 roses. Imma will receive 1/2 of the roses, so Imma will receive 300 * 1/2 = 150 roses.

Hanna will give 100 roses to Jenna and 150 roses to Imma. To find the total number of roses Hanna gives to her friends, we add 100 + 150 = 250 roses.

Answer: 250
