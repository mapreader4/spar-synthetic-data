Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total revenue from the tickets:

* Matinee tickets: 32 customers * $5 = $160
* Evening tickets: 40 customers * $7 = $280
* Opening night tickets: 58 customers * $10 = $580
Total ticket revenue: $160 + $280 + $580 = $1,020

Now, let's find the number of customers who bought popcorn. Since half of the customers bought popcorn, we know that 50% of the total customers bought popcorn. The total number of customers is 32 + 40 + 58 = 130. So, 50% of 130 is 65.

Let's calculate the revenue from popcorn:

* 65 customers * $10 = $650

Now, let's add the revenue from tickets and popcorn:

$1,020 (ticket revenue) + $650 (popcorn revenue) = $1,670

Answer: 1670
