To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of shark sightings in Cape May. Since Daytona Beach has 26 shark sightings a year, and Daytona Beach has 5 more than triple the number of shark sightings as Cape May, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of shark sightings in Cape May.

Let x be the number of shark sightings in Cape May.

The equation would be: 

26 = 3x

We know that Daytona Beach has 26 shark sightings, so we can substitute 26 for x in the equation:

26 = 3x

We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 26 / 3

x = 8.67

So, Cape May has 8.67 shark sightings a year.
