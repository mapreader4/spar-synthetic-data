Let's break this down step by step.

Amara had 100 pieces of clothing initially.

She donated 5 pieces to one orphanage home.

So, she has 100 - 5 = 95 pieces of clothing left.

Then, she donated 3 times 5 = 15 pieces to another orphanage home.

So, she has 95 - 15 = 80 pieces of clothing left.

Answer: 80
