Let's start by stating the information given in the problem. Aaron has 4 brothers. The problem states that the number of Bennett's brothers is two less than twice the number of Aaron's brothers. Let's call the number of Aaron's brothers x. Then, the number of Bennett's brothers would be 2x.

We know that Aaron has 4 brothers, so x = 4. Now, we can find the number of Bennett's brothers. We are told that this number is 2x - 2. Since x = 4, this number is 4 - 2 = 2. So, the number of Bennett's brothers is 2.
