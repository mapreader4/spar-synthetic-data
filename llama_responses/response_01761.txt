Let's start by identifying the given information.

Kevin sells a total of 50 crates of fruit per week. Let's subtract the number of crates of grapes (13) and mangoes (20) from the total number of crates sold. This will give us the number of crates of passion fruits he sold:

50 - 13 - 20 = 17

Answer: 17
