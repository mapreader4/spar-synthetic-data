Let's start by identifying the total number of boats. Madison makes 30 boats.

Madison sets 20 of them afloat. So, the number of boats in the water is 20.

Madison shoots 2 of the boats with flaming arrows. So, the number of boats left is reduced by 2.

To find the number of boats left, we need to subtract 2 from the original 20 boats.

20 - 2 = 18

Answer: 18
