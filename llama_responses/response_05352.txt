Let's break this down step by step:

Let's let C be the age of Cooper, D be the age of Dante, and M be the age of Maria. The sum of their ages is 31, so we can write the equation:

C + D + M = 31

We know that Maria is one year older than Dante, so M = D + 1. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

C + D + D + 1 = 31

We also know that Dante is twice as old as Cooper, so we can write D = 2C. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

C + 2C + D + 1 = 31

We can now solve for C:

C + 2C + C + 1 = 31

Combine like terms:

3C + 1 = 31

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3C = 30

So, Cooper is 10 years old.
