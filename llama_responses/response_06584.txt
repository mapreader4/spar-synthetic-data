Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find the total cost of the items without the discount.

4 T-shirts cost 4 x $20 = $80
3 pairs of pants cost 3 x $80 = $240
2 pairs of shoes cost 2 x $150 = $300

The total cost before the discount is 80 + 240 + 300 = $320.

Now, we need to find the discount. The discount is 10%, so we multiply the total cost by 0.9 to get the final cost.

0.9 x 320 = 288

Answer: 288
