Let's break down the information given into steps:

1. The town spends 15% of its annual budget on its public library.
2. Centerville spent $3,000 on its public library. So, 15% of the annual budget is equal to $3,000.

To find the annual budget, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the annual budget. Then, 15% of x is equal to 3,000. So, 0.15x = 3,000.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get rid of the decimal:

0.15x * 100 = 3000 * 100

This simplifies to:

15x = 3000 * 100

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15:

x = 3000 / 15

x = 200

Answer: 200
