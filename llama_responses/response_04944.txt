To solve this problem, I will start by identifying the total number of trips the two sons went to the park. The oldest son went 35 times, and the youngest went 15 times. So, the total number of trips is 35 + 15 = 50.

Next, I will find the total cost for the passes. The cost of each pass is $100.00, so the total cost is 2 passes x 100.00 = 200.00.

To find the cost per trip, I will divide the total cost by the total number of trips. 200.00 / 50 = 4.00.

Answer: 4.00
