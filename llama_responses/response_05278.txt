Let's start by identifying the number of water bottles in the box. There are 2 dozen water bottles. 2 dozen is 24, so there are 24 water bottles.

Since there are half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles, that means there are 12 more apple bottles. So, the total number of bottles in the box is 24 (water) + 12 (apple) = 36.
