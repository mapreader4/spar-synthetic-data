Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first calculate the time it takes to go up to the first floor, since it's an even-numbered floor. It takes 15 seconds.

Then, we need to find the time it takes to go up to the 2nd floor, 4th floor, 6th floor, 8th floor, 10th floor, and so on.

Since the pattern is 15 seconds for even-numbered floors, we can say that it takes 15 seconds to go up to the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th floor, and so on.
