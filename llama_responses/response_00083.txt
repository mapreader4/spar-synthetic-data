Let's break this down step by step.

Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats. Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats as Paityn, so Zola has 20 * 4/5 = 16 red hats. Zola has twice as many blue hats as Paityn, so Zola has 24 * 2 = 48 blue hats.

In total, Paityn and Zola have 20 + 24 + 16 + 48 = 108 hats.

If they share the hats equally, they will each get 108 / 2 = 54 hats.

Answer: 54
