Let's start by identifying the number of boots: Nancy has 6 pairs of boots, so that is 12 shoes. She has 9 more pairs of slippers than boots, which means she has 12 + 9 = 21 pairs of slippers. The number of pairs of heels is equal to three times the combined number of slippers and boots, so it is 3 * (12 + 12) = 36. The total number of shoes is 12 + 21 + 36 = 69. So, Nancy has 69 shoes.
