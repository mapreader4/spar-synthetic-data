Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate how much money Sally needs to save up for the trip.

To get to Sea World, Sally needs to save up for the following expenses:

1. Parking: $10
2. Meal pass: $25
3. Gas: The distance to Sea World is 165 miles, and her car gets 30 miles per gallon of gas. So, the number of gallons of gas she needs is 165 / 30 = 5.5. Since gas costs $3 a gallon, the cost of gas is 5.5 * 3 = $16.5. So, the total cost of gas is $16.5.

The total amount Sally needs to save up is the sum of the costs of these expenses:

$10 + $25 + $16.5 = $51.5

Step 2: Calculate how much more Sally needs to save up.

Sally already has $28 saved. To find out how much more she needs to save up, we subtract the amount she already has from the total amount needed:

$51.5 - $28 = $23.5

Answer: 23.5
