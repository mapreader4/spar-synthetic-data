Let's break this problem down step by step.

Day 1: Maria sold 30 tulips and 20 roses. So, the total amount earned on the first day is:

30 tulips * 2 = 60 dollars (since each tulip costs 2 dollars)
20 roses * 3 = 60 dollars (since each rose costs 3 dollars)
Total amount earned on day 1 = 60 + 60 = 120 dollars

Day 2: Maria doubled the previous day's sales, so she sold 2 * (30 tulips + 20 roses) = 2 * 50 = 100 flowers. Since the price of a tulip is 2 dollars and the price of a rose is 3 dollars, the total amount earned on the second day is:

100 * 2 = 200 dollars (tulips)
100 * 3 = 300 dollars (roses)
Total amount earned on day 2 = 200 + 300 = 500 dollars

Day 3: Maria sold 10% of the tulips sold on the second day, which is 10% of 100 = 10. So, she sold 10 tulips. She also sold 16 roses. The total amount earned on the third day is:

10 tulips * 2 = 20 dollars
16 roses * 3 = 48 dollars
Total amount earned on day 3 = 20 + 48 = 68 dollars

To find the total amount earned over the three days, we add up the amounts earned on each day:

120 + 500 + 68 = 688

Answer: 688
