Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's first find out how many liters of air Ross inhales in 1 minute:

We know that Ross inhales 17 breaths per minute, and each breath is 5/9 liter of air. So, in 1 minute, he inhales 17 * 5/9 = 10 liters of air.

Now, we can find out how many liters of air Ross inhales in 24 hours:

We know that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, in 24 hours, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 seconds.

We can convert seconds to minutes by dividing 1440 by 60, which gives us 24 minutes.

Now, we can find out how many liters of air Ross inhales in 24 minutes:

We know that Ross inhales 10 liters of air in 1 minute. So, in 24 minutes, he inhales 10 * 24 = 240 liters of air.

So, the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours is 240 liters.

Answer: 240
