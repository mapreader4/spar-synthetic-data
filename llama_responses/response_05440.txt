Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jaime saves $50 each week.
2. She spends $46 every 2 weeks, which is equivalent to $23 per week.
3. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save $135, we can divide $135 by $23. This is because we want to find the number of times it will take Jaime to save $135, given that she spends $23 each week.

$135 รท 23 = 5.83 (round down to the nearest whole number, since we can't save a fraction of a week)
