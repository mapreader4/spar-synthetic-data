Let's break this down step by step:

1. The two flat tires are empty, so they need 500 cubic inches of air each. That's a total of 1000 cubic inches of air needed to fill them.
2. The one tire that's 40% full has 0.4 x 500 = 200 cubic inches of air already in it.
3. The last tire that's 70% full has 0.7 x 500 = 350 cubic inches of air already in it.
4. So, in total, the tires need 1000 - 200 - 350 = 450 cubic inches of air to be filled.

Carson needs to inject 50 cubic inches of air with each pump. So, to fill the tires, it will take:

450 / 50 = 9 pumps.
