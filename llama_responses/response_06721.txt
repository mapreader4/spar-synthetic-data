Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by converting the height of the tree from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert the height of the tree from feet to inches by multiplying the height by 12.

The height of the tree is 52 feet, so we multiply 52 * 12 = 624 inches.

Now, the tree grows 5 feet each year, so in 8 years, it will grow 8 * 5 = 40 feet.

We add the initial height of the tree, 624 inches, to the height it will be after 8 years, which is 624 inches.

Answer: 624
