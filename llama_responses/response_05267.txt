To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the items James bought, then add the tax, and then find the total cost.

The cost of the milk is $3. The cost of the bunch of bananas is $2. The cost of the milk and bananas combined is $3 + $2 = $5.

Then, the 20% sales tax is 0.2 x $5 = $1. The total cost is $5 + $1 = $6.

So, James spent $6.
