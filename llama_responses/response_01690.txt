Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the total amount of centimeters that fell on Mondays.

The amount of centimeters that fell on Mondays is 7 * 1.5 = 7.5.

Now, let's find the total amount of centimeters that fell on Tuesdays.

The amount of centimeters that fell on Tuesdays is 9 * 2.5 = 22.5.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total amount of centimeters that fell on Tuesdays and the total amount of centimeters that fell on Mondays.

The difference is 22.5 - 7.5 = 15.

Answer: 15
