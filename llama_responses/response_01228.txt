Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of drums of paint the paint mixer makes in one day is x.

Then, to make 18 drums of paint, it takes him 3 days. So, the number of drums of paint the paint mixer makes in one day is 18/3 = 6.

Now, to make 360 drums of paint, we need to find out how many days it will take. We know that 360/6 = 60.

So, the paint mixer will take 60 days to make 360 drums of paint.

Answer: 60
