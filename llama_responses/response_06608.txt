Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of cardio machines:

Each gym has 10 bikes, 5 treadmills, and 5 elliptical machines, so the total number of cardio machines per gym is:

10 (bikes) + 5 (treadmills) + 5 (elliptical machines) = 20

Since there are 20 gyms, the total number of cardio machines is:

20 (gyms) x 20 (machines per gym) = 400

Now, let's find the cost of each type of machine:

Bikes cost $700 each
Treadmills cost 50% more than bikes, so treadmills cost $700 + (50% of $700) = $700 + $350 = $1050
Elliptical machines are twice as expensive as treadmills, so elliptical machines cost 2 x $1050 = $2100

Now, let's find the total cost of replacing all the cardio machines:

Bikes: 400 (machines) x $700 (cost per machine) = $280,000
Treadmills: 400 (machines) x $1050 (cost per machine) = $420,000
Elliptical machines: 400 (machines) x $2100 (cost per machine) = $840,000

The total cost of replacing all the cardio machines is:

$280,000 + $420,000 + $840,000 = $1,540,000
