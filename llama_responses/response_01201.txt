Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by finding the sum of Betty and Doug's ages.

Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts, so let's represent it as "x". Doug is 40 years old, so Betty's age is 2x.

The sum of their ages is 90, so we can set up the equation 2x + 40 = 90.

Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation to get 2x = 50.

Now we know Betty's age is 50, which is the cost of a pack of nuts.

The cost of 20 packs of nuts is 20 * x, so we can set up the equation 20x = 50.

Now, to find the cost of 20 packs of nuts, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50, so we get 20 * 50 = 1000.

So, Betty will pay 1000 for 20 packs of nuts.
