Let's break down the cost of the items:

1. Sofa: $1,250
2. 2 armchairs: 2 x $425 = $850
Total cost of furniture: $1,250 + $850 = $2,100

The total amount of the invoice is $2,430, which is the sum of the cost of the sofa and the 2 armchairs. To find the cost of the coffee table, we can subtract the total cost of the furniture from the total invoice:

$2,430 (total invoice) - $2,100 (cost of furniture) = $330

Answer: 330
