To solve this problem, we can use a percentage problem. The percentage of visitors who fell ill is 40%, which means that 40% of the total visitors fell ill. To find the number of visitors who fell ill, we can use the following formula:

Number of visitors who fell ill = Total visitors * 0.40

In this case, the total number of visitors is 500. So, the number of visitors who fell ill is:

500 * 0.40 = 200

Answer: 200
