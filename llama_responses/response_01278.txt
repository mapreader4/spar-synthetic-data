Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the length of the green piece of yarn. It is 156 cm.

The red yarn is 8 cm more than three times the length of the green yarn. So, let's find the length of the red yarn. 3 times the length of the green yarn is 3 x 156 = 468. 468 + 8 = 476.

So, the total length of the two pieces of yarn is 156 + 476 = 632. 

Answer: 632
