Let's break this down step by step:

1. The number of girls in the school is half of 100, which is 50.
2. The number of boys in the school is also half of 100, which is 50.
3. 20% of the 50 girls have dogs at home. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which is 10.
4. 10% of the 50 boys have dogs at home. To find 10% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.1, which is 5.
5. The total number of students who have dogs at home is 10 + 5, which is 15.

Answer: 15
