Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of green marbles is x. We know that the number of green marbles is half of the number of red marbles, so we can write that as an equation:

x = 38 / 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x * 2 = 76

x = 38

Now, we know that the total number of marbles is 63, which is the sum of the number of red, green, and dark blue marbles. We know that the number of red marbles is 38, and the number of green marbles is 38, so we can write that as an equation:

38 + 38 + dark blue = 63

Now, we want to solve for the number of dark blue marbles. We can subtract the number of red and green marbles from both sides of the equation:

38 + 38 = 63 - 38

63 - 38 = 25

Answer: 25
