To solve this problem, I will first find the amount Kate has. She has a third of the price of the pen, which is 30 dollars. To find a third of 30, I will divide 30 by 3, which is 10. So Kate has 10 dollars. To find the amount of money she needs, I will subtract the money she has from the price of the pen, which is 30. So, I will subtract 10 from 30, which is 20. The answer is: Answer: 20.
