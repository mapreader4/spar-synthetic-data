Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. First, let's find the daily earnings of each employee:
Robby earns $10 per hour, and works 10 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$10 x 10 = $100

Jaylen also earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$10 x 10 = $100

Miranda earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day, so her daily earnings are:
$10 x 10 = $100

2. Next, let's find the daily savings of each employee:
Robby saves 2/5 of his salary, which is:
$100 x 2/5 = $40

Jaylen saves 3/5 of his salary, which is:
$100 x 3/5 = $60

Miranda saves half of her salary, which is:
$100 x 1/2 = $50

3. Now, let's find the combined daily savings of the three employees:
$40 (Robby) + $60 (Jaylen) + $50 (Miranda) = $150

4. Finally, we need to find the combined savings for four weeks. Since they work 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks, we multiply the daily savings by 20 (5 days x 4 weeks):
$150 x 20 = $3000

Answer: 3000
