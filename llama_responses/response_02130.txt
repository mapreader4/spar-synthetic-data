Let's break it down step by step.

Let's start by calculating the cost of the second course. The second course costs $5 more than the first course, which is $15, so the second course is $15 + 5 = $20.

The cost of the dessert is 25% of the price of the second course, which is $20. To find 25% of $20, we can multiply $20 by 0.25 to get $5.

The total cost of the meal is the sum of the cost of the first course, the cost of the second course, and the cost of the dessert. The cost of the first course is $15, the cost of the second course is $20, and the cost of the dessert is $5. So, the total cost is $15 + $20 + $5 = $40.

Amelia has $60 to spend, and the total cost of the meal is $40. So, she will have $20 left after buying all those meals.
