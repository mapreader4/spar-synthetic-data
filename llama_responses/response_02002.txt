Let's break this problem down step by step.

The US flag has 50 stars, and Pete uses 3 less than half the number of stars. To find half the number of stars, we divide 50 by 2, which gives us 25. Then, we subtract 3 from 25, which gives us 22.

The US flag has 13 stripes, and Pete uses six more than twice the number of stripes. To find twice the number of stripes, we multiply 13 by 2, which gives us 26. Then, we add 6 to 26, which gives us 32.

Now, we need to find the combined total number of circles and squares on Pete's flag. We can do this by adding the number of circles (22) and the number of squares (32).

22 + 32 = 54

Answer: 54
