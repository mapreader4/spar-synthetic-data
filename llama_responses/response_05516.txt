Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "A cat has nine lives." This means that the cat has 9 lives.

Next, we know that "A dog has 3 less lives than a cat." This means that the dog has 9 - 3 = 6 lives.

Then, we know that "A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog." This means that the mouse has 6 + 7 = 13 lives.

So, the mouse has 13 lives.

Answer: 13
