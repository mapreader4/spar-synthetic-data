Let's break this down step by step.

Let's start with the information given: "the river is five feet deep in mid-May" and "the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-June".

We can write this as an equation: 5 + 10 = x, where x is the river's depth in mid-June.

So, the river's depth in mid-June is 15 feet.

Now, the problem says the river is three times deeper in mid-July than mid-June. We can write this as an equation: 3 * 15 = x.

So, we can solve for x: 3 * 15 = 45.

Answer: 45
