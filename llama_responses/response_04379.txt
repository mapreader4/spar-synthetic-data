Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Jeremy's average speed is 50 miles per hour, so to find the time it takes him to drive 600 miles, we can divide 600 by 50:

600 miles / 50 mph = 12 hours

So, Jeremy will take 12 hours to drive to his parents' house.

2. Jeremy makes a rest stop every 2 hours, and he drives for 12 hours. This means he will make 6 rest stops (12 hours / 2 hours per stop = 6 stops).

3. Each rest stop takes 15 minutes, so the total time spent on rest stops is:

6 stops * 15 minutes per stop = 90 minutes

4. Jeremy's car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons. This means he will need to refill his gas tank 15 / 18 = 0.833333... times, which we can round up to 1 time, since he can't refill a fraction of a tank.

5. Refilling his gas tank takes 10 minutes, so the total time spent refilling gas is:

1 refill * 10 minutes = 10 minutes

6. Now, we add up the total time spent driving, resting, and refilling gas:

12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes (driving time)
+ 90 minutes (resting time)
+ 10 minutes (refilling gas time)
= 820 minutes

Answer: 820
