Let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire has 24 hours in a day.
2. She has 4 hours to clean and 2 hours to cook, so she spends a total of 6 hours on these tasks.
3. The remaining hours in the day are 24 - 6 = 18.
4. She divides the remaining 18 hours into two parts: 9 hours for crafting and 9 hours for tailoring.
5. So, Claire spends 9 hours crafting.
