Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's start by finding the number of open parking spots on each level:

1. First level: 4
2. Second level: 4 + 7 = 11
3. Third level: 11 + 6 = 17
4. Fourth level: 17 + 14 = 31

Now, let's add up the number of open parking spots on each level:

4 + 11 + 17 + 31 = 62

Answer: 62
