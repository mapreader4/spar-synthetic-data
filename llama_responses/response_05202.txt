To find the total cost, we need to multiply the cost of the candy bars and chips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the candy bars is 5 students * 1 candy bar per student * 2 dollars per candy bar = 10 dollars.

The cost of the chips is 5 students * 2 bags of chips per student * 0.50 dollars per bag of chips = 10 dollars.

The total cost is 10 dollars + 10 dollars = 20 dollars.

Answer: 20
