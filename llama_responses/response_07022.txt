Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total amount of coffee beans Suki and Jimmy had. Suki had 6.5 bags of coffee beans that each weighed 22 kilograms, so she had a total of 6.5 x 22 = 143 kilograms of coffee beans. Jimmy had 4.5 bags of coffee beans that each weighed 18 kilograms, so he had a total of 4.5 x 18 = 81 kilograms of coffee beans. The total amount of coffee beans Suki and Jimmy had is 143 + 81 = 224 kilograms.

Next, we need to find how many 8-kilogram containers they can hold. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of coffee beans by the weight of each container. 224 kilograms divided by 8 kilograms is 224 รท 8 = 28. So, Suki and Jimmy used 28 containers to repackaged their coffee beans.
